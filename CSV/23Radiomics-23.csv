2017,A deep feature fusion methodology for breast cancer diagnosis demonstrated on three imaging modality datasets,"Background: Deep learning methods for radiomics/computer‐aided diagnosis (CADx) are often prohibited by small datasets, long computation time, and the need for extensive image preprocessing. Aims: We aim to develop a breast CADx methodology that addresses the aforementioned issues by exploiting the efficiency of pre‐trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and using pre‐existing handcrafted CADx features. Materials & Methods: We present a methodology that extracts and pools low‐ to mid‐level features using a pretrained CNN and fuses them with handcrafted radiomic features computed using conventional CADx methods. Our methodology is tested on three different clinical imaging modalities (dynamic contrast enhanced‐MRI [690 cases], full‐field digital mammography [245 cases], and ultrasound [1125 cases]). Results: From ROC analysis, our fusion‐based method demonstrates, on all three imaging modalities, statistically significant improvements in terms of AUC as compared to previous breast cancer CADx methods in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. (DCE‐MRI [AUC = 0.89 (se = 0.01)], FFDM [AUC = 0.86 (se = 0.01)], and ultrasound [AUC = 0.90 (se = 0.01)]). Discussion/Conclusion: We proposed a novel breast CADx methodology that can be used to more effectively characterize breast lesions in comparison to existing methods. Furthermore, our proposed methodology is computationally efficient and circumvents the need for image preprocessing."
2021,Contrast-enhanced Mammography: State of the Art.,"Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has emerged as a viable alternative to contrast-enhanced breast MRI, and it may increase access to vascular imaging while reducing examination cost. Intravenous iodinated contrast materials are used in CEM to enhance the visualization of tumor neovascularity. After injection, imaging is performed with dual-energy digital mammography, which helps provide a low-energy image and a recombined or iodine image that depict enhancing lesions in the breast. CEM has been demonstrated to help improve accuracy compared with digital mammography and US in women with abnormal screening mammographic findings or symptoms of breast cancer. It has also been demonstrated to approach the accuracy of breast MRI in preoperative staging of patients with breast cancer and in monitoring response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There are early encouraging results from trials evaluating CEM in the screening of women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Although CEM is a promising tool, it slightly increases radiation dose and carries a small risk of adverse reactions to contrast materials. This review details the CEM technique, diagnostic and screening uses, and future applications, including artificial intelligence and radiomics."
2020,Deep Learning vs. Radiomics for Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis of Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound Images: Don't Forget the Peritumoral Region,"Objective: Axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis status is important in guiding treatment in breast cancer. The aims were to assess how deep convolutional neural network (CNN) performed compared with radiomics analysis in predicting ALN metastasis using breast ultrasound, and to investigate the value of both intratumoral and peritumoral regions in ALN metastasis prediction. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 479 breast cancer patients with 2,395 breast ultrasound images. Based on the intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined intra- and peritumoral regions, three CNNs were built using DenseNet, and three radiomics models were built using random forest, respectively. By combining the molecular subtype, another three CNNs and three radiomics models were built. All models were built on training cohort (343 patients 1,715 images) and evaluated on testing cohort (136 patients 680 images) with ROC analysis. Another prospective cohort of 16 patients was enrolled to further test the models. Results: AUCs of image-only CNNs in both training/testing cohorts were 0.957/0.912 for combined region, 0.944/0.775 for peritumoral region, and 0.937/0.748 for intratumoral region, which were numerically higher than their corresponding radiomics models with AUCs of 0.940/0.886, 0.920/0.724, and 0.913/0.693. The overall performance of image-molecular CNNs in terms of AUCs on training/testing cohorts slightly increased to 0.962/0.933, 0.951/0.813, and 0.931/0.794, respectively. AUCs of both CNNs and radiomics models built on combined region were significantly better than those on either intratumoral or peritumoral region on the testing cohort (p < 0.05). In the prospective study, the CNN model built on combined region achieved the highest AUC of 0.95 among all image-only models. Conclusions: CNNs showed numerically better overall performance compared with radiomics models in predicting ALN metastasis in breast cancer. For both CNNs and radiomics models, combining intratumoral, and peritumoral regions achieved significantly better performance."
2019,Radiomics of Brain MRI: Utility in Prediction of Metastatic Tumor Type.,"Purpose To investigate the feasibility of tumor type prediction with MRI radiomic image features of different brain metastases in a multiclass machine learning approach for patients with unknown primary lesion at the time of diagnosis. Materials and methods This single-center retrospective analysis included radiomic features of 658 brain metastases from T1-weighted contrast material-enhanced, T1-weighted nonenhanced, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in 189 patients (101 women, 88 men; mean age, 61 years; age range, 32-85 years). Images were acquired over a 9-year period (from September 2007 through December 2016) with different MRI units, reflecting heterogeneous image data. Included metastases originated from breast cancer (n = 143), small cell lung cancer (n = 151), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 225), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 50), and melanoma (n = 89). A total of 1423 quantitative image features and basic clinical data were evaluated by using random forest machine learning algorithms. Validation was performed with model-external fivefold cross validation. Comparative analysis of 10 randomly drawn cross-validation sets verified the stability of the results. The classifier performance was compared with predictions from a respective conventional reading by two radiologists. Results Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the five-class problem ranged between 0.64 (for non-small cell lung cancer) and 0.82 (for melanoma); all P values were less than .01. Prediction performance of the classifier was superior to the radiologists' readings. Highest differences were observed for melanoma, with a 17-percentage-point gain in sensitivity compared with the sensitivity of both readers; P values were less than .02. Conclusion Quantitative features of routine brain MR images used in a machine learning classifier provided high discriminatory accuracy in predicting the tumor type of brain metastases. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2019,Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.,"Computer-aided detection or diagnosis (CAD) has been a promising area of research over the last two decades. Medical image analysis aims to provide a more efficient diagnostic and treatment process for the radiologists and clinicians. However, with the development of science and technology, data interpretation manually in the conventional CAD systems has gradually become a challenging task. Deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are successfully used as tools to solve this problem. This includes applications such as breast cancer diagnosis, lung nodule detection and prostate cancer localization. In this overview, the current state-of-the-art medical image analysis techniques in CAD research are presented, which focus on the convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods. The commonly used medical image databases in literature are also listed. It is anticipated that this paper can provide researchers in radiomics, precision medicine, and imaging grouping with a systematic picture of the CNN-based methods used in CAD research."
2019,Radiomics Analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer,"Purpose: To investigate whether a combination of radiomics and automatic machine learning applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of primary breast cancer can non-invasively predict axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (~80%) and a validation set (~20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application."
2020,Novel Approaches to Screening for Breast Cancer.,"Screening for breast cancer reduces breast cancer-related mortality and earlier detection facilitates less aggressive treatment. Unfortunately, current screening modalities are imperfect, suffering from limited sensitivity and high false-positive rates. Novel techniques in the field of breast imaging may soon play a role in breast cancer screening: digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast material-enhanced spectral mammography, US (automated three-dimensional breast US, transmission tomography, elastography, optoacoustic imaging), MRI (abbreviated and ultrafast, diffusion-weighted imaging), and molecular breast imaging. Artificial intelligence and radiomics have the potential to further improve screening strategies. Furthermore, nonimaging-based screening tests such as liquid biopsy and breathing tests may transform the screening landscape. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2020,Radiomics Improves Cancer Screening and Early Detection,"Imaging is a key technology in the early detection of cancers, including X-ray mammography, low-dose CT for lung cancer, or optical imaging for skin, esophageal, or colorectal cancers. Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence (AI). These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models and the significant limitations to this development, including access to well-annotated databases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.

2021,Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes Prediction by Mammographic Radiomics Features,"Rationale and Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether quantitative radiomics features extracted from digital mammogram images are associated with molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: In this institutional review board approved retrospective study, we collected 331 Chinese women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015. This cohort included 29 triple-negative, 45 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, 36 luminal A, and 221 luminal B lesions. A set of 39 quantitative radiomic features, including morphological, gray scale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmented lesion area. Three binary-classifications of the subtypes were performed: triple-negative vs. non-triplenegative, HER2-enriched vs. non-HER2-enriched, and luminal (A+B) vs. non-luminal. The Naive Bayes machine learning scheme was employed for the classification and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select most predictive features for the classifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy.

2021,Breast ultrasound tumour classification: A Machine Learning—Radiomics based approach,"Prediction of breast tumour malignancy using ultrasound imaging, is an important step for early detection of breast cancer. An efficient prediction system can be a great help to improve the survival chances of the involved patients. In this work, a machine learning (ML)—radiomics based classification pipeline is proposed, to perform this predictive modelling task, in a much more efficient manner. Multiple different types of image features of the region of interests are considered in this work, followed by a recursive feature elimination based feature selection step. Furthermore, a synthetic minority oversampling technique based step is also included in the pipeline, to deal with the class imbalance problem, that is often present in medical imaging datasets. Various ML models are considered in the subsequent model training phase, on a publicly available breast ultrasound image dataset (BUSI). From experimental analysis it has been observed that, shape, texture and histogram oriented gradients related features are the most informative, with respect to the predictive modelling task. Furthermore, it was observed that ensemble learners such as random forest, gradient boosting and AdaBoost classifiers are able to achieve significant results with respect to multiple evaluation metrics. The proposed approach achieved the state‐of‐the‐art accuracy, area under the curve, F1‐score and Mathews correlation coefficient values of 0.974, 0.97, 0.94 and 0.959, respectively, on the BUSI dataset. Such kind of impressive results suggest that the proposed approach can have a very high practical utility, in real medical diagnostic settings."
2019,Machine Learning-Based Analysis of MR Multiparametric Radiomics for the Subtype Classification of Breast Cancer,"Objective: To investigate whether machine learning analysis of multiparametric MR radiomics can help classify immunohistochemical (IHC) subtypes of breast cancer. Study design: One hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients with pathologically-proven invasive ductal carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 2,498 features were extracted from the DCE and DWI images, together with the new calculated images, including DCE images changing over six time points (DCEsequential) and DWI images changing over three b-values (DWIsequential). We proposed a novel two-stage feature selection method combining traditional statistics and machine learning-based methods. The accuracies of the 4-IHC classification and triple negative (TN) vs. non-TN cancers were assessed. Results: For the 4-IHC classification task, the best accuracy of 72.4% was achieved based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or subspace discrimination of assembled learning in conjunction with 20 selected features, and only small dependent emphasis of Kendall-tau-b for sequential features, based on the DWIsequential with the LDA model, yielding an accuracy of 53.7%. The linear support vector machine (SVM) and medium k-nearest neighbor using eight features yielded the highest accuracy of 91.0% for comparing TN to non-TN cancers, and the maximum variance for DWIsequential alone, together with a linear SVM model, achieved an accuracy of 83.6%. Conclusions: Whole-tumor radiomics on MR multiparametric images, DCE images changing over time points, and DWI images changing over different b-values provide a non-invasive analytical approach for breast cancer subtype classification and TN cancer identification."
2020,New Machine Learning Applications to Accelerate Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer: Rise of the Support Vector Machines.,"Artificial intelligence, machine learning, health care robots, and algorithms for clinical decision-making are currently being sought after in diverse fields of clinical medicine and bioengineering. The field of personalized medicine stands to benefit from new technologies so as to harness the omics big data, for example, to individualize and accelerate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in particular. In this overarching context, breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with multiple underlying molecular etiologies and each subtype displaying diverse clinical outcomes. Disease stratification for breast cancer is, therefore, vital to its effective and individualized clinical care. The support vector machine (SVM) is a rising machine learning approach that offers robust classification of high-dimensional big data into small numbers of data points (support vectors), achieving differentiation of subgroups in a short amount of time. Considering the rapid timelines required for both diagnosis and treatment of most aggressive cancers, this new machine learning technique has important clinical and public applications and implications for high-throughput data analysis and contextualization. This expert review describes and examines, first, the SVM models employed to forecast breast cancer subtypes using diverse systems science data, including transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and radiomics, as well as biological pathway, clinical, pathological, and biochemical data. Then, we compare the performance of the present SVM and other diagnostic and therapeutic prediction models across the data types. We conclude by emphasizing that data integration is a critical bottleneck in systems science, cancer research and development, and health care innovation and that SVM and machine learning approaches offer new solutions and ways forward in biomedical, bioengineering, and clinical applications."
2020,Non-Invasive Assessment of Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics,"We evaluated the performance of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of breast cancer molecular subtypes. Ninety-one breast cancer patients who underwent 3T dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping were included retrospectively. Radiomic features were extracted from manually drawn regions of interest (n = 704 features per lesion) on initial DCE-MRI and ADC maps. The ten best features for subtype separation were selected using probability of error and average correlation coefficients. For pairwise comparisons with >20 patients in each group, a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was used (70% of cases for training, 30%, for validation, five times each). For all other separations, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and leave-one-out cross-validation were applied. Histopathology served as the reference standard. MLP-ANN yielded an overall median area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (0.77–0.92) for the separation of triple negative (TN) from other cancers. The separation of luminal A and TN cancers yielded an overall median AUC of 0.8 (0.75–0.83). Radiomics and AI from multiparametric MRI may aid in the non-invasive differentiation of TN and luminal A breast cancers from other subtypes."
2021,Breast MRI for Evaluation of Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy.,"Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being used to treat early-stage triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor 2-overexpressing breast cancers, as well as locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers. The rationales for neoadjuvant therapy are to shrink tumor size and potentially decrease the extent of surgery, to serve as an in vivo test of response to therapy, and to reveal prognostic information for the patient. MRI is the most accurate modality to demonstrate response to therapy and to help ensure accurate presurgical planning. Changes in lesion diameter, volume, and enhancement are used to predict complete response, partial response, or nonresponse to therapy. However, residual disease may be overestimated or underestimated at MRI. Fibrosis, necrotic tumors, and residual benign masses may be causes of overestimation of residual disease. Nonmass lesions, invasive lobular carcinoma, hormone receptor-positive tumors, nonconcentric shrinkage patterns, the use of antiangiogenic therapy, and late-enhancing foci may be causes of underestimation of residual disease. In patients with known axillary lymph node metastasis, neoadjuvant therapy may be followed by targeted axillary dissection to avoid the potential morbidity associated with an axillary lymph node dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging, radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning methods are under investigation to improve MRI accuracy in predicting treatment response.©RSNA, 2021."
2023,A bibliometric analysis of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection,"Prostate cancer stands as one of the most prevalent cancers globally among men, exhibiting substantial geographical variations in both incidence and mortality. While developed countries bear a higher incidence, developing countries grapple with elevated mortality rates. The heightened mortality in the latter is attributed to variations in practices that impede early diagnosis. In this context, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become increasingly common to improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer. This review delves into the existing literature to scrutinize the utilization of AI and ML in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. To compile relevant literature, comprehensive searches were conducted on research databases, including SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, to identify articles related to AI or ML (AI/ML) in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Using a screening criterion, 293 reviewed research papers were identified. The two most consistent themes were predictive modeling and the application of AI/ML tools for cancer grading and radiomics. AI and ML enhance diagnostic accuracy by reducing inter-individual variation in Gleason&rsquo;s scoring and complimenting the interpretation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). A few publications reported the use of AI/ML tools that combine histopathology with MRI signals. The literature surveyed indicates a compelling potential for AI and ML to improve diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer. Emerging literature suggests the use of a combination of demographic features, clinical data, serological markers, pathological grading and radiological factors, and genomic data to propose an accurate, non-invasive diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer."
2022,Breast Tumor Classification in Digital Tomosynthesis Based on Deep Learning Radiomics,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women globally. Early and accurate detection and classification of breast tumors are critical in improving treatment strategies and increasing the patient survival rate. Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is an advanced form of mammography that aids better in the early detection and diagnosis of breast disease. This paper proposes a breast tumor classification method based on analyzing and evaluating the performance of various of the most innovative deep learning classification models in cooperation with a support vector machine (SVM) classifier for a DBT dataset. Specifically, we study the ability to use transfer learning from non-medical images to classify tumors in unseen DBT medical images. In addition, we utilize the fine-tuning technique to improve classification accuracy."
2022,A bibliometric analysis of use of Machine learning and Artificial intelligence in Prostate Cancer Detection,"Objectives: Prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers worldwide in men, with a huge geographical variation both in incidence and mortality. Whereas, the incidence is higher in developed countries, mortality is higher in developing countries. The reasons for high mortality in these countries include variation in practice leading to early diagnosis. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine learning (ML) are increasingly being used to improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer. We interrogated the published literature to review the usage of AI and ML in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Methods: Research databases such as SCOPUS, Web of Science (WoS), and Google Scholar were searched to identify articles related to AI/ML in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Key-words included (“prostate” AND “cancer”), (“machine” AND (“learn” OR “learning”)) OR (“artificial” AND (“intelligence” OR “intelligent”)). Results Using a screening criterion, 293 reviewed research papers were identified. The two most consistent themes were predictive modeling and application of AI/ ML tools for cancer grading and radiomics. AI and ML enhance the diagnostic accuracy by reducing the inter-individual variation in Gleason’s scoring, and complimenting the interpretation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). A few publications reported the use of AI/ML tools by combining histopathology and MRI signals. Conclusions: AI and ML can improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer. Literature is beginning to emerge suggesting to use a combination of demographic features, clinical data, serological markers, pathological grading and radiological factors, and genomic data, to propose accurate non-invasive diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer."
2021,Prostate Cancer Delineation in MRI Images Based on Deep Learning: Quantitative Comparison and Promising Perspective,"Prostate cancer is the most common malignant male tumor. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of prostate cancer diseases. Computer-aided diagnosis systems can help doctors to analyze MRI images and detect prostate cancer earlier. One of the key stages of prostate cancer CAD systems is the automatic delineation of the prostate. Deep learning has recently demonstrated promising segmentation results with medical images. The purpose of this paper is to compare the state-of-the-art of deep learning-based approaches for prostate delineation in MRI images and discussing their limitations and strengths. Besides, we introduce a promising perspective for prostate tumor classification in MRI images. This perspective includes the use of the best segmentation model to detect the prostate tumors in MRI images. Then, we will employ the segmented images to extract the radiomics features that will be used to discriminate benign or malignant prostate tumors."
2020,Breast Cancer Mass Detection in DCE-MRI Using Deep-Learning Features Followed by Discrimination of Infiltrative vs In Situ Carcinoma through A Machine-learning Approach,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in women. This aggressive tumour can be categorized into two main groups: in situ and infiltrative, with the latter being the most common malignant lesions. The current use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was shown to provide highest sensitivity in the detection and discrimination between benign vs. malignant lesions, when interpreted by expert radiologists. In this article, we present the prototype of a Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) system that could provide valuable assistance to the radiologist for the discrimination between in situ and infiltrating tumours. The system consists of two main processing levels: 1) Localization of possibly tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) through an iterative procedure based on intensity values (ROI Hunter) followed by a deep-feature extraction and classification method for false-positive rejection; 2) Characterization of the selected ROIs and discrimination between in situ and invasive tumour, consisting of Radiomics feature extraction and classification through a machine-learning algorithm. The CAD system was developed and evaluated using a DCE-MRI image database, containing at least one confirmed mass per image, as diagnosed by an expert radiologist. When evaluating the accuracy of the ROI Hunter procedure with respect to the radiologist-drawn boundaries, sensitivity to mass detection was found to be 75%. The AUC of the ROC curve for discrimination between in situ and infiltrative tumors was 0.70."
2017,Integrated radiomic framework for breast cancer and tumor biology using advanced machine learning and multiparametric MRI,"Abstract: Radiomics deals with the high throughput extraction of quantitative textural information from radiological images that not visually perceivable by radiologists. However, the biological correlation between radiomic features and different tissues of interest has not been established. To that end, we present the radiomic feature mapping framework to generate radiomic MRI texture image representations called the radiomic feature maps (RFM) and correlate the RFMs with quantitative texture values, breast tissue biology using quantitative MRI and classify benign from malignant tumors. We tested our radiomic feature mapping framework on a retrospective cohort of 124 patients (26 benign and 98 malignant) who underwent multiparametric breast MR imaging at 3 T. The MRI parameters used were T1-weighted imaging, T2-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) and diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). The RFMs were computed by convolving MRI images with statistical filters based on first order statistics and gray level co-occurrence matrix features. Malignant lesions demonstrated significantly higher entropy on both post contrast DCE-MRI (Benign-DCE entropy: 5.72 ± 0.12, Malignant-DCE entropy: 6.29 ± 0.06,"
2023,Develop and validate a radiomics space-time model to predict the pathological complete response in patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer: an artificial intelligence model study based on machine learning,"Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the predictive efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features at different time points of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer in patients with pathological complete response (pCR). Furthermore, we aimed to develop and validate a radiomics space–time model (RSTM) using machine learning for artificial intelligence interventions in predicting pCR in patients. Methods: Clinical and imaging data of 83 rectal cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed, and the patients were classified as pCR and non-pCR patients according to their postoperative pathological results. All patients received one MRI examination before and after neoadjuvant therapy to extract radiomics features, including pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features. Delta features were defined by the ratio of the difference between the pre- and the post-treatment features to the pre-treatment feature. After feature dimensionality reduction based on the above three feature types, the RSTM was constructed using machine learning methods, and its performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Results: The AUC values of the individual basic models constructed by pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features were 0.771, 0.681, and 0.871, respectively. Their sensitivity values were 0.727, 0.864, and 0.909, respectively, and their specificity values were 0.803, 0.492, and 0.656, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values of the combined basic model constructed by combining pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features were 0.901, 0.909, and 0.803, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values of the RSTM constructed using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier on the basis of the combined basic model were 0.944, 0.871, and 0.983, respectively. The Delong test showed that the performance of RSTM was significantly different from that of pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta models ( Conclusions: The RSTM constructed using the KNN classifier based on the combined features of before and after neoadjuvant therapy and delta features had the best predictive efficacy for pCR of neoadjuvant therapy. It may emerge as a new clinical tool to assist with individualized management of rectal cancer patients."

2022,Transformer-Based Radiomics for Predicting Breast Tumor Malignancy Score in Ultrasonography,"Breast cancer must be detected early to reduce the mortality rate. Ultrasound images can make it easier for the clinician to diagnose cases of dense breasts. This study presents a deep vision transformer-based approach for predicting breast cancer malignancy scores from ultrasound images. In particular, various state-of-the-art deep vision transformers such as BEiT, CaiT, Swin, XCiT, and Vis-Former are adapted and trained to extract robust radiomics to classify breast tumors in ultrasound images as benign or malignant. The best-performing model is used to predict the malignancy score of each input ultrasound image. Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach achieves promising results for the detection of malignant tumors of the breast on ultrasound images."
