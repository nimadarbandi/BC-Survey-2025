2017,Diagnostic Assessment of Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Women With Breast Cancer,"Importance Application of deep learning algorithms to whole-slide pathology images can potentially improve diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Objective Assess the performance of automated deep learning algorithms at detecting metastases in hematoxylin and eosin–stained tissue sections of lymph nodes of women with breast cancer and compare it with pathologists’ diagnoses in a diagnostic setting. Design, Setting, and Participants Researcher challenge competition (CAMELYON16) to develop automated solutions for detecting lymph node metastases (November 2015-November 2016). A training data set of whole-slide images from 2 centers in the Netherlands with (n = 110) and without (n = 160) nodal metastases verified by immunohistochemical staining were provided to challenge participants to build algorithms. Algorithm performance was evaluated in an independent test set of 129 whole-slide images (49 with and 80 without metastases). The same test set of corresponding glass slides was also evaluated by a panel of 11 pathologists with time constraint (WTC) from the Netherlands to ascertain likelihood of nodal metastases for each slide in a flexible 2-hour session, simulating routine pathology workflow, and by 1 pathologist without time constraint (WOTC). Exposures Deep learning algorithms submitted as part of a challenge competition or pathologist interpretation. Main Outcomes and Measures The presence of specific metastatic foci and the absence vs presence of lymph node metastasis in a slide or image using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The 11 pathologists participating in the simulation exercise rated their diagnostic confidence as definitely normal, probably normal, equivocal, probably tumor, or definitely tumor. Results The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the algorithms ranged from 0.556 to 0.994. The top-performing algorithm achieved a lesion-level, true-positive fraction comparable with that of the pathologist WOTC (72.4% [95% CI, 64.3%-80.4%]) at a mean of 0.0125 false-positives per normal whole-slide image. For the whole-slide image classification task, the best algorithm (AUC, 0.994 [95% CI, 0.983-0.999]) performed significantly better than the pathologists WTC in a diagnostic simulation (mean AUC, 0.810 [range, 0.738-0.884]; P < .001). The top 5 algorithms had a mean AUC that was comparable with the pathologist interpreting the slides in the absence of time constraints (mean AUC, 0.960 [range, 0.923-0.994] for the top 5 algorithms vs 0.966 [95% CI, 0.927-0.998] for the pathologist WOTC). Conclusions and Relevance In the setting of a challenge competition, some deep learning algorithms achieved better diagnostic performance than a panel of 11 pathologists participating in a simulation exercise designed to mimic routine pathology workflow; algorithm performance was comparable with an expert pathologist interpreting whole-slide images without time constraints. Whether this approach has clinical utility will require evaluation in a clinical setting."
2019,Trastuzumab Deruxtecan in Previously Treated HER2-Positive Breast Cancer.,"BACKGROUND Trastuzumab deruxtecan (DS-8201) is an antibody-drug conjugate composed of an anti-HER2 (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) antibody, a cleavable tetrapeptide-based linker, and a cytotoxic topoisomerase I inhibitor. In a phase 1 dose-finding study, a majority of the patients with advanced HER2-positive breast cancer had a response to trastuzumab deruxtecan (median response duration, 20.7 months). The efficacy of trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer previously treated with trastuzumab emtansine requires confirmation. METHODS In this two-part, open-label, single-group, multicenter, phase 2 study, we evaluated trastuzumab deruxtecan in adults with pathologically documented HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer who had received previous treatment with trastuzumab emtansine. In the first part of the study, we evaluated three different doses of trastuzumab deruxtecan to establish a recommended dose; in the second part, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of the recommended dose. The primary end point was the objective response, according to independent central review. Key secondary end points were the disease-control rate, clinical-benefit rate, duration of response and progression-free survival, and safety. RESULTS Overall, 184 patients who had undergone a median of six previous treatments received the recommended dose of trastuzumab deruxtecan (5.4 mg per kilogram of body weight). In the intention-to-treat analysis, a response to therapy was reported in 112 patients (60.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 53.4 to 68.0). The median duration of follow-up was 11.1 months (range, 0.7 to 19.9). The median response duration was 14.8 months (95% CI, 13.8 to 16.9), and the median duration of progression-free survival was 16.4 months (95% CI, 12.7 to not reached). During the study, the most common adverse events of grade 3 or higher were a decreased neutrophil count (in 20.7% of the patients), anemia (in 8.7%), and nausea (in 7.6%). On independent adjudication, the trial drug was associated with interstitial lung disease in 13.6% of the patients (grade 1 or 2, 10.9%; grade 3 or 4, 0.5%; and grade 5, 2.2%). CONCLUSIONS Trastuzumab deruxtecan showed durable antitumor activity in a pretreated patient population with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer. In addition to nausea and myelosuppression, interstitial lung disease was observed in a subgroup of patients and requires attention to pulmonary symptoms and careful monitoring.

2016,A Dataset for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification,"Today, medical image analysis papers require solid experiments to prove the usefulness of proposed methods. However, experiments are often performed on data selected by the researchers, which may come from different institutions, scanners, and populations. Different evaluation measures may be used, making it difficult to compare the methods. In this paper, we introduce a dataset of 7909 breast cancer histopathology images acquired on 82 patients, which is now publicly available from http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. The dataset includes both benign and malignant images. The task associated with this dataset is the automated classification of these images in two classes, which would be a valuable computer-aided diagnosis tool for the clinician. In order to assess the difficulty of this task, we show some preliminary results obtained with state-of-the-art image classification systems. The accuracy ranges from 80% to 85%, showing room for improvement is left. By providing this dataset and a standardized evaluation protocol to the scientific community, we hope to gather researchers in both the medical and the machine learning field to advance toward this clinical application."
2016,Clinical Applications of Circulating Tumor Cells and Circulating Tumor DNA as Liquid Biopsy.,"UNLABELLED ""Liquid biopsy"" focusing on the analysis of circulating tumor cells (CTC) and circulating cell-free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of patients with cancer has received enormous attention because of its obvious clinical implications for personalized medicine. Analyses of CTCs and ctDNA have paved new diagnostic avenues and are, to date, the cornerstones of liquid biopsy diagnostics. The present review focuses on key areas of clinical applications of CTCs and ctDNA, including detection of cancer, prediction of prognosis in patients with curable disease, monitoring systemic therapies, and stratification of patients based on the detection of therapeutic targets or resistance mechanisms. SIGNIFICANCE The application of CTCs and ctDNA for the early detection of cancer is of high public interest, but it faces serious challenges regarding specificity and sensitivity of the current assays. Prediction of prognosis in patients with curable disease can already be achieved in several tumor entities, particularly in breast cancer. Monitoring the success or failure of systemic therapies (i.e., chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or other targeted therapies) by sequential measurements of CTCs or ctDNA is also feasible. Interventional studies on treatment stratification based on the analysis of CTCs and ctDNA are needed to implement liquid biopsy into personalized medicine. Cancer Discov; 6(5); 479-91. ©2016 AACR."
2016,Deep Learning for Identifying Metastatic Breast Cancer,"The International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI) held a grand challenge to evaluate computational systems for the automated detection of metastatic breast cancer in whole slide images of sentinel lymph node biopsies. Our team won both competitions in the grand challenge, obtaining an area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) of 0.925 for the task of whole slide image classification and a score of 0.7051 for the tumor localization task. A pathologist independently reviewed the same images, obtaining a whole slide image classification AUC of 0.966 and a tumor localization score of 0.733. Combining our deep learning system's predictions with the human pathologist's diagnoses increased the pathologist's AUC to 0.995, representing an approximately 85 percent reduction in human error rate. These results demonstrate the power of using deep learning to produce significant improvements in the accuracy of pathological diagnoses."
2017,Classification of breast cancer histology images using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide. The diagnosis of biopsy tissue with hematoxylin and eosin stained images is non-trivial and specialists often disagree on the final diagnosis. Computer-aided Diagnosis systems contribute to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of this process. Conventional classification approaches rely on feature extraction methods designed for a specific problem based on field-knowledge. To overcome the many difficulties of the feature-based approaches, deep learning methods are becoming important alternatives. A method for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained breast biopsy images using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is proposed. Images are classified in four classes, normal tissue, benign lesion, in situ carcinoma and invasive carcinoma, and in two classes, carcinoma and non-carcinoma. The architecture of the network is designed to retrieve information at different scales, including both nuclei and overall tissue organization. This design allows the extension of the proposed system to whole-slide histology images. The features extracted by the CNN are also used for training a Support Vector Machine classifier. Accuracies of 77.8% for four class and 83.3% for carcinoma/non-carcinoma are achieved. The sensitivity of our method for cancer cases is 95.6%."
2016,Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE) for Nuclei Detection on Breast Cancer Histopathology Images,"Automated nuclear detection is a critical step for a number of computer assisted pathology related image analysis algorithms such as for automated grading of breast cancer tissue specimens. The Nottingham Histologic Score system is highly correlated with the shape and appearance of breast cancer nuclei in histopathological images. However, automated nucleus detection is complicated by 1) the large number of nuclei and the size of high resolution digitized pathology images, and 2) the variability in size, shape, appearance, and texture of the individual nuclei. Recently there has been interest in the application of “Deep Learning” strategies for classification and analysis of big image data. Histopathology, given its size and complexity, represents an excellent use case for application of deep learning strategies. In this paper, a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder (SSAE), an instance of a deep learning strategy, is presented for efficient nuclei detection on high-resolution histopathological images of breast cancer. The SSAE learns high-level features from just pixel intensities alone in order to identify distinguishing features of nuclei. A sliding window operation is applied to each image in order to represent image patches via high-level features obtained via the auto-encoder, which are then subsequently fed to a classifier which categorizes each image patch as nuclear or non-nuclear. Across a cohort of 500 histopathological images (2200 × 2200) and approximately 3500 manually segmented individual nuclei serving as the groundtruth, SSAE was shown to have an improved F-measure 84.49% and an average area under Precision-Recall curve (AveP) 78.83%. The SSAE approach also out-performed nine other state of the art nuclear detection strategies."
2016,Breast cancer histopathological image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks,"The performance of most conventional classification systems relies on appropriate data representation and much of the efforts are dedicated to feature engineering, a difficult and time-consuming process that uses prior expert domain knowledge of the data to create useful features. On the other hand, deep learning can extract and organize the discriminative information from the data, not requiring the design of feature extractors by a domain expert. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are a particular type of deep, feedforward network that have gained attention from research community and industry, achieving empirical successes in tasks such as speech recognition, signal processing, object recognition, natural language processing and transfer learning. In this paper, we conduct some preliminary experiments using the deep learning approach to classify breast cancer histopathological images from BreaKHis, a publicly dataset available at http://web.inf.ufpr.br/vri/breast-cancer-database. We propose a method based on the extraction of image patches for training the CNN and the combination of these patches for final classification. This method aims to allow using the high-resolution histopathological images from BreaKHis as input to existing CNN, avoiding adaptations of the model that can lead to a more complex and computationally costly architecture. The CNN performance is better when compared to previously reported results obtained by other machine learning models trained with hand-crafted textural descriptors. Finally, we also investigate the combination of different CNNs using simple fusion rules, achieving some improvement in recognition rates."
2014,"Prevalence, mechanisms, and management of cancer-related cognitive impairment","Abstract This review summarizes the current literature on cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) with a focus on prevalence, mechanisms, and possible interventions for CRCI in those who receive adjuvant chemotherapy for non-central nervous system tumours and is primarily focused on breast cancer. CRCI is characterized as deficits in areas of cognition including memory, attention, concentration, and executive function. Development of CRCI can impair quality of life and impact treatment decisions. CRCI is highly prevalent; these problems can be detected in up to 30% of patients prior to chemotherapy, up to 75% of patients report some form of CRCI during treatment, and CRCI is still present in up to 35% of patients many years following completion of treatment. While the trajectory of CRCI is becoming better understood, the mechanisms underlying the development of CRCI are still obscure; however, host characteristics, immune dysfunction, neural toxicity, and genetics may play key roles in the development and trajectory of CRCI. Intervention research is limited, though strategies to maintain function are being studied with promising preliminary findings. This review highlights key research being conducted in these areas, both in patient populations and in animals, which will ultimately result in better understanding and effective treatments for CRCI."
2014,Automatic detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in whole slide images with convolutional neural networks,"This paper presents a deep learning approach for automatic detection and visual analysis of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) tissue regions in whole slide images (WSI) of breast cancer (BCa). Deep learning approaches are learn-from-data methods involving computational modeling of the learning process. This approach is similar to how human brain works using different interpretation levels or layers of most representative and useful features resulting into a hierarchical learned representation. These methods have been shown to outpace traditional approaches of most challenging problems in several areas such as speech recognition and object detection. Invasive breast cancer detection is a time consuming and challenging task primarily because it involves a pathologist scanning large swathes of benign regions to ultimately identify the areas of malignancy. Precise delineation of IDC in WSI is crucial to the subsequent estimation of grading tumor aggressiveness and predicting patient outcome. DL approaches are particularly adept at handling these types of problems, especially if a large number of samples are available for training, which would also ensure the generalizability of the learned features and classifier. The DL framework in this paper extends a number of convolutional neural networks (CNN) for visual semantic analysis of tumor regions for diagnosis support. The CNN is trained over a large amount of image patches (tissue regions) from WSI to learn a hierarchical part-based representation. The method was evaluated over a WSI dataset from 162 patients diagnosed with IDC. 113 slides were selected for training and 49 slides were held out for independent testing. Ground truth for quantitative evaluation was provided via expert delineation of the region of cancer by an expert pathologist on the digitized slides. The experimental evaluation was designed to measure classifier accuracy in detecting IDC tissue regions in WSI. Our method yielded the best quantitative results for automatic detection of IDC regions in WSI in terms of F-measure and balanced accuracy (71.80%, 84.23%), in comparison with an approach using handcrafted image features (color, texture and edges, nuclear textural and architecture), and a machine learning classifier for invasive tumor classification using a Random Forest. The best performing handcrafted features were fuzzy color histogram (67.53%, 78.74%) and RGB histogram (66.64%, 77.24%). Our results also suggest that at least some of the tissue classification mistakes (false positives and false negatives) were less due to any fundamental problems associated with the approach, than the inherent limitations in obtaining a very highly granular annotation of the diseased area of interest by an expert pathologist."
2019,Mechanisms of Chemotherapy Resistance in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer—How We Can Rise to the Challenge,"Triple-negative (TNBC) is the most lethal subtype of breast cancer owing to high heterogeneity, aggressive nature, and lack of treatment options. Chemotherapy remains the standard of care for TNBC treatment, but unfortunately, patients frequently develop resistance. Accordingly, in recent years, tremendous effort has been made into elucidating the mechanisms of TNBC chemoresistance with the goal of identifying new molecular targets. It has become evident that the development of TNBC chemoresistance is multifaceted and based on the elaborate interplay of the tumor microenvironment, drug efflux, cancer stem cells, and bulk tumor cells. Alterations of multiple signaling pathways govern these interactions. Moreover, TNBC’s high heterogeneity, highlighted in the existence of several molecular signatures, presents a significant obstacle to successful treatment. In the present, in-depth review, we explore the contribution of key mechanisms to TNBC chemoresistance as well as emerging strategies to overcome them. We discuss novel anti-tumor agents that target the components of these mechanisms and pay special attention to their current clinical development while emphasizing the challenges still ahead of successful TNBC management. The evidence presented in this review outlines the role of crucial pathways in TNBC survival following chemotherapy treatment and highlights the importance of using combinatorial drug strategies and incorporating biomarkers in clinical studies."
2019,A Deep Learning Mammography-based Model for Improved Breast Cancer Risk Prediction.,"Background Mammographic density improves the accuracy of breast cancer risk models. However, the use of breast density is limited by subjective assessment, variation across radiologists, and restricted data. A mammography-based deep learning (DL) model may provide more accurate risk prediction. Purpose To develop a mammography-based DL breast cancer risk model that is more accurate than established clinical breast cancer risk models. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 88 994 consecutive screening mammograms in 39 571 women between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2012. For each patient, all examinations were assigned to either training, validation, or test sets, resulting in 71 689, 8554, and 8751 examinations, respectively. Cancer outcomes were obtained through linkage to a regional tumor registry. By using risk factor information from patient questionnaires and electronic medical records review, three models were developed to assess breast cancer risk within 5 years: a risk-factor-based logistic regression model (RF-LR) that used traditional risk factors, a DL model (image-only DL) that used mammograms alone, and a hybrid DL model that used both traditional risk factors and mammograms. Comparisons were made to an established breast cancer risk model that included breast density (Tyrer-Cuzick model, version 8 [TC]). Model performance was compared by using areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) with DeLong test (P < .05). Results The test set included 3937 women, aged 56.20 years ± 10.04. Hybrid DL and image-only DL showed AUCs of 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.75) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.64, 0.73), respectively. RF-LR and TC showed AUCs of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.72) and 0.62 (95% CI: 0.57, 0.66), respectively. Hybrid DL showed a significantly higher AUC (0.70) than TC (0.62; P < .001) and RF-LR (0.67; P = .01). Conclusion Deep learning models that use full-field mammograms yield substantially improved risk discrimination compared with the Tyrer-Cuzick (version 8) model. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

2016,AggNet: Deep Learning From Crowds for Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histology Images,"The lack of publicly available ground-truth data has been identified as the major challenge for transferring recent developments in deep learning to the biomedical imaging domain. Though crowdsourcing has enabled annotation of large scale databases for real world images, its application for biomedical purposes requires a deeper understanding and hence, more precise definition of the actual annotation task. The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy? Our experimental setup involved Annot8, a self-implemented web-platform based on Crowdflower API realizing image annotation tasks for a publicly available biomedical image database. Our results give valuable insights into the functionality of deep CNN learning from crowd annotations and prove the necessity of data aggregation integration."
2019,Stand-Alone Artificial Intelligence for Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography: Comparison With 101 Radiologists.,"BACKGROUND Artificial intelligence (AI) systems performing at radiologist-like levels in the evaluation of digital mammography (DM) would improve breast cancer screening accuracy and efficiency. We aimed to compare the stand-alone performance of an AI system to that of radiologists in detecting breast cancer in DM. METHODS Nine multi-reader, multi-case study datasets previously used for different research purposes in seven countries were collected. Each dataset consisted of DM exams acquired with systems from four different vendors, multiple radiologists' assessments per exam, and ground truth verified by histopathological analysis or follow-up, yielding a total of 2652 exams (653 malignant) and interpretations by 101 radiologists (28 296 independent interpretations). An AI system analyzed these exams yielding a level of suspicion of cancer present between 1 and 10. The detection performance between the radiologists and the AI system was compared using a noninferiority null hypothesis at a margin of 0.05. RESULTS The performance of the AI system was statistically noninferior to that of the average of the 101 radiologists. The AI system had a 0.840 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.820 to 0.860) area under the ROC curve and the average of the radiologists was 0.814 (95% CI = 0.787 to 0.841) (difference 95% CI = -0.003 to 0.055). The AI system had an AUC higher than 61.4% of the radiologists. CONCLUSIONS The evaluated AI system achieved a cancer detection accuracy comparable to an average breast radiologist in this retrospective setting. Although promising, the performance and impact of such a system in a screening setting needs further investigation."
2020,Assessment of Ki67 in Breast Cancer: Updated Recommendations From the International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group,"Abstract Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC), commonly used as a proliferation marker in breast cancer, has limited value for treatment decisions due to questionable analytical validity. The International Ki67 in Breast Cancer Working Group (IKWG) consensus meeting, held in October 2019, assessed the current evidence for Ki67 IHC analytical validity and clinical utility in breast cancer, including the series of scoring studies the IKWG conducted on centrally stained tissues. Consensus observations and recommendations are: 1) as for estrogen receptor and HER2 testing, preanalytical handling considerations are critical; 2) a standardized visual scoring method has been established and is recommended for adoption; 3) participation in and evaluation of quality assurance and quality control programs is recommended to maintain analytical validity; and 4) the IKWG accepted that Ki67 IHC as a prognostic marker in breast cancer has clinical validity but concluded that clinical utility is evident only for prognosis estimation in anatomically favorable estrogen receptor–positive and HER2-negative patients to identify those who do not need adjuvant chemotherapy. In this T1-2, N0-1 patient group, the IKWG consensus is that Ki67 5% or less, or 30% or more, can be used to estimate prognosis. In conclusion, analytical validity of Ki67 IHC can be reached with careful attention to preanalytical issues and calibrated standardized visual scoring. Currently, clinical utility of Ki67 IHC in breast cancer care remains limited to prognosis assessment in stage I or II breast cancer. Further development of automated scoring might help to overcome some current limitations."
2019,Detection of Breast Cancer with Mammography: Effect of an Artificial Intelligence Support System.,"Purpose To compare breast cancer detection performance of radiologists reading mammographic examinations unaided versus supported by an artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods An enriched retrospective, fully crossed, multireader, multicase, HIPAA-compliant study was performed. Screening digital mammographic examinations from 240 women (median age, 62 years; range, 39-89 years) performed between 2013 and 2017 were included. The 240 examinations (100 showing cancers, 40 leading to false-positive recalls, 100 normal) were interpreted by 14 Mammography Quality Standards Act-qualified radiologists, once with and once without AI support. The readers provided a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System score and probability of malignancy. AI support provided radiologists with interactive decision support (clicking on a breast region yields a local cancer likelihood score), traditional lesion markers for computer-detected abnormalities, and an examination-based cancer likelihood score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), specificity and sensitivity, and reading time were compared between conditions by using mixed-models analysis dof variance and generalized linear models for multiple repeated measurements. Results On average, the AUC was higher with AI support than with unaided reading (0.89 vs 0.87, respectively; P = .002). Sensitivity increased with AI support (86% [86 of 100] vs 83% [83 of 100]; P = .046), whereas specificity trended toward improvement (79% [111 of 140]) vs 77% [108 of 140]; P = .06). Reading time per case was similar (unaided, 146 seconds; supported by AI, 149 seconds; P = .15). The AUC with the AI system alone was similar to the average AUC of the radiologists (0.89 vs 0.87). Conclusion Radiologists improved their cancer detection at mammography when using an artificial intelligence system for support, without requiring additional reading time.

2019,"Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment: An update on state of the art, detection, and management strategies in cancer survivors.","BACKGROUND Advances in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in oncology have significantly increased the chance of survival of cancer patients, even those with metastatic disease. However, cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is frequently reported in patients treated for non-central nervous system cancers, particularly during and after chemotherapy. DESIGN This review provides an update of the state of the art based on PubMed searches between 2012 and March 2019 on ""cognition"", ""cancer"", ""antineoplastic agents"" or ""chemotherapy"". It includes the most recent clinical, imaging and pre-clinical data and reports management strategies of CRCI. RESULTS Evidence obtained primarily from studies on breast cancer patients highlight memory, processing speed, attention, and executive functions as the most cognitive domains impaired post-chemotherapy. Recent investigations established that other cancer treatments, such as hormone therapies and targeted therapies, can also induce cognitive deficits. Knowledge regarding predisposing factors, biological markers or brain functions associated with CRCI has improved. Factors such as age and genetic polymorphisms of apolipoprotein E, catechol-O-methyltransferase and BDNF may predispose individuals to a higher risk of cognitive impairment. Poor performance on neuropsychological tests were associated with volume reduction in grey matter, less connectivity and activation after chemotherapy. In animals, hippocampus-based memory and executive functions, mediated by the frontal lobes, were shown to be particularly susceptible to the effects of chemotherapy. It involves altered neurogenesis, mitochondrial dysfunction or brain cytokine response. An important next step is to identify strategies for managing cognitive difficulties, with primary studies to assess cognitive training and physical exercise regimens. CONCLUSIONS CRCI is not limited to chemotherapy. A multidisciplinary approach has improved our knowledge of the complex mechanisms involved. Nowadays, studies evaluating cognitive rehabilitation programs are encouraged to help patients cope with cognitive difficulties and improve quality of life during and after cancer."
2017,DNA methylation markers for diagnosis and prognosis of common cancers,"Significance The ability to identify a specific cancer using minimally invasive biopsy holds great promise for improving diagnosis and prognosis. We evaluated the utility of DNA methylation profiles for differentiating tumors and normal tissues for four common cancers (lung, breast, colon, and liver) and found that they could differentiate cancerous tissue from normal tissue with >95% accuracy. This signature also correctly identified 19 of 20 breast cancer metastases and 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver. We report that methylation patterns can predict the prognosis and survival, with good correlation between differential methylation of CpG sites and expression of cancer-associated genes. Their findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization, diagnosis, and prognosis of cancer. The ability to identify a specific cancer using minimally invasive biopsy holds great promise for improving the diagnosis, treatment selection, and prediction of prognosis in cancer. Using whole-genome methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and machine learning methods, we evaluated the utility of DNA methylation for differentiating tumor tissue and normal tissue for four common cancers (breast, colon, liver, and lung). We identified cancer markers in a training cohort of 1,619 tumor samples and 173 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. We replicated our findings in a separate TCGA cohort of 791 tumor samples and 93 matched adjacent normal tissue samples, as well as an independent Chinese cohort of 394 tumor samples and 324 matched adjacent normal tissue samples. The DNA methylation analysis could predict cancer versus normal tissue with more than 95% accuracy in these three cohorts, demonstrating accuracy comparable to typical diagnostic methods. This analysis also correctly identified 29 of 30 colorectal cancer metastases to the liver and 32 of 34 colorectal cancer metastases to the lung. We also found that methylation patterns can predict prognosis and survival. We correlated differential methylation of CpG sites predictive of cancer with expression of associated genes known to be important in cancer biology, showing decreased expression with increased methylation, as expected. We verified gene expression profiles in a mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the utility of methylation biomarkers for the molecular characterization of cancer, with implications for diagnosis and prognosis."
2016,Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to Breast Density Segmentation and Mammographic Risk Scoring,"Mammographic risk scoring has commonly been automated by extracting a set of handcrafted features from mammograms, and relating the responses directly or indirectly to breast cancer risk. We present a method that learns a feature hierarchy from unlabeled data. When the learned features are used as the input to a simple classifier, two different tasks can be addressed: i) breast density segmentation, and ii) scoring of mammographic texture. The proposed model learns features at multiple scales. To control the models capacity a novel sparsity regularizer is introduced that incorporates both lifetime and population sparsity. We evaluated our method on three different clinical datasets. Our state-of-the-art results show that the learned breast density scores have a very strong positive relationship with manual ones, and that the learned texture scores are predictive of breast cancer. The model is easy to apply and generalizes to many other segmentation and scoring problems."
2019,Breast cancer detection using deep convolutional neural networks and support vector machines,"It is important to detect breast cancer as early as possible. In this manuscript, a new methodology for classifying breast cancer using deep learning and some segmentation techniques are introduced. A new computer aided detection (CAD) system is proposed for classifying benign and malignant mass tumors in breast mammography images. In this CAD system, two segmentation approaches are used. The first approach involves determining the region of interest (ROI) manually, while the second approach uses the technique of threshold and region based. The deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) is used for feature extraction. A well-known DCNN architecture named AlexNet is used and is fine-tuned to classify two classes instead of 1,000 classes. The last fully connected (fc) layer is connected to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier to obtain better accuracy. The results are obtained using the following publicly available datasets (1) the digital database for screening mammography (DDSM); and (2) the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of DDSM (CBIS-DDSM). Training on a large number of data gives high accuracy rate. Nevertheless, the biomedical datasets contain a relatively small number of samples due to limited patient volume. Accordingly, data augmentation is a method for increasing the size of the input data by generating new data from the original input data. There are many forms for the data augmentation; the one used here is the rotation. The accuracy of the new-trained DCNN architecture is 71.01% when cropping the ROI manually from the mammogram. The highest area under the curve (AUC) achieved was 0.88 (88%) for the samples obtained from both segmentation techniques. Moreover, when using the samples obtained from the CBIS-DDSM, the accuracy of the DCNN is increased to 73.6%. Consequently, the SVM accuracy becomes 87.2% with an AUC equaling to 0.94 (94%). This is the highest AUC value compared to previous work using the same conditions."
2018,1399 H&E-stained sentinel lymph node sections of breast cancer patients: the CAMELYON dataset,"Abstract Background The presence of lymph node metastases is one of the most important factors in breast cancer prognosis. The most common way to assess regional lymph node status is the sentinel lymph node procedure. The sentinel lymph node is the most likely lymph node to contain metastasized cancer cells and is excised, histopathologically processed, and examined by a pathologist. This tedious examination process is time-consuming and can lead to small metastases being missed. However, recent advances in whole-slide imaging and machine learning have opened an avenue for analysis of digitized lymph node sections with computer algorithms. For example, convolutional neural networks, a type of machine-learning algorithm, can be used to automatically detect cancer metastases in lymph nodes with high accuracy. To train machine-learning models, large, well-curated datasets are needed. Results We released a dataset of 1,399 annotated whole-slide images (WSIs) of lymph nodes, both with and without metastases, in 3 terabytes of data in the context of the CAMELYON16 and CAMELYON17 Grand Challenges. Slides were collected from five medical centers to cover a broad range of image appearance and staining variations. Each WSI has a slide-level label indicating whether it contains no metastases, macro-metastases, micro-metastases, or isolated tumor cells. Furthermore, for 209 WSIs, detailed hand-drawn contours for all metastases are provided. Last, open-source software tools to visualize and interact with the data have been made available. Conclusions A unique dataset of annotated, whole-slide digital histopathology images has been provided with high potential for re-use."
2018,Impact of Deep Learning Assistance on the Histopathologic Review of Lymph Nodes for Metastatic Breast Cancer,"Advances in the quality of whole-slide images have set the stage for the clinical use of digital images in anatomic pathology. Along with advances in computer image analysis, this raises the possibility for computer-assisted diagnostics in pathology to improve histopathologic interpretation and clinical care. To evaluate the potential impact of digital assistance on interpretation of digitized slides, we conducted a multireader multicase study utilizing our deep learning algorithm for the detection of breast cancer metastasis in lymph nodes. Six pathologists reviewed 70 digitized slides from lymph node sections in 2 reader modes, unassisted and assisted, with a wash-out period between sessions. In the assisted mode, the deep learning algorithm was used to identify and outline regions with high likelihood of containing tumor. Algorithm-assisted pathologists demonstrated higher accuracy than either the algorithm or the pathologist alone. In particular, algorithm assistance significantly increased the sensitivity of detection for micrometastases (91% vs. 83%, P=0.02). In addition, average review time per image was significantly shorter with assistance than without assistance for both micrometastases (61 vs. 116 s, P=0.002) and negative images (111 vs. 137 s, P=0.018). Lastly, pathologists were asked to provide a numeric score regarding the difficulty of each image classification. On the basis of this score, pathologists considered the image review of micrometastases to be significantly easier when interpreted with assistance (P=0.0005). Utilizing a proof of concept assistant tool, this study demonstrates the potential of a deep learning algorithm to improve pathologist accuracy and efficiency in a digital pathology workflow."
2016,Deep learning for magnification independent breast cancer histopathology image classification,"Microscopic analysis of breast tissues is necessary for a definitive diagnosis of breast cancer which is the most common cancer among women. Pathology examination requires time consuming scanning through tissue images under different magnification levels to find clinical assessment clues to produce correct diagnoses. Advances in digital imaging techniques offers assessment of pathology images using computer vision and machine learning methods which could automate some of the tasks in the diagnostic pathology workflow. Such automation could be beneficial to obtain fast and precise quantification, reduce observer variability, and increase objectivity. In this work, we propose to classify breast cancer histopathology images independent of their magnifications using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). We propose two different architectures; single task CNN is used to predict malignancy and multi-task CNN is used to predict both malignancy and image magnification level simultaneously. Evaluations and comparisons with previous results are carried out on BreaKHis dataset. Experimental results show that our magnification independent CNN approach improved the performance of magnification specific model. Our results in this limited set of training data are comparable with previous state-of-the-art results obtained by hand-crafted features. However, unlike previous methods, our approach has potential to directly benefit from additional training data, and such additional data could be captured with same or different magnification levels than previous data."
2017,A deep feature fusion methodology for breast cancer diagnosis demonstrated on three imaging modality datasets,"Background: Deep learning methods for radiomics/computer‐aided diagnosis (CADx) are often prohibited by small datasets, long computation time, and the need for extensive image preprocessing. Aims: We aim to develop a breast CADx methodology that addresses the aforementioned issues by exploiting the efficiency of pre‐trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and using pre‐existing handcrafted CADx features. Materials & Methods: We present a methodology that extracts and pools low‐ to mid‐level features using a pretrained CNN and fuses them with handcrafted radiomic features computed using conventional CADx methods. Our methodology is tested on three different clinical imaging modalities (dynamic contrast enhanced‐MRI [690 cases], full‐field digital mammography [245 cases], and ultrasound [1125 cases]). Results: From ROC analysis, our fusion‐based method demonstrates, on all three imaging modalities, statistically significant improvements in terms of AUC as compared to previous breast cancer CADx methods in the task of distinguishing between malignant and benign lesions. (DCE‐MRI [AUC = 0.89 (se = 0.01)], FFDM [AUC = 0.86 (se = 0.01)], and ultrasound [AUC = 0.90 (se = 0.01)]). Discussion/Conclusion: We proposed a novel breast CADx methodology that can be used to more effectively characterize breast lesions in comparison to existing methods. Furthermore, our proposed methodology is computationally efficient and circumvents the need for image preprocessing."
2019,Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning: A Bibliographic Review,"In this paper, we first describe the basics of the field of cancer diagnosis, which includes steps of cancer diagnosis followed by the typical classification methods used by doctors, providing a historical idea of cancer classification techniques to the readers. These methods include Asymmetry, Border, Color and Diameter (ABCD) method, seven-point detection method, Menzies method, and pattern analysis. They are used regularly by doctors for cancer diagnosis, although they are not considered very efficient for obtaining better performance. Moreover, considering all types of audience, the basic evaluation criteria are also discussed. The criteria include the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC curve), Area under the ROC curve (AUC), F1 score, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, dice-coefficient, average accuracy, and Jaccard index. Previously used methods are considered inefficient, asking for better and smarter methods for cancer diagnosis. Artificial intelligence and cancer diagnosis are gaining attention as a way to define better diagnostic tools. In particular, deep neural networks can be successfully used for intelligent image analysis. The basic framework of how this machine learning works on medical imaging is provided in this study, i.e., pre-processing, image segmentation and post-processing. The second part of this manuscript describes the different deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial models (GANs), deep autoencoders (DANs), restricted Boltzmann’s machine (RBM), stacked autoencoders (SAE), convolutional autoencoders (CAE), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), long short-term memory (LTSM), multi-scale convolutional neural network (M-CNN), multi-instance learning convolutional neural network (MIL-CNN). For each technique, we provide Python codes, to allow interested readers to experiment with the cited algorithms on their own diagnostic problems. The third part of this manuscript compiles the successfully applied deep learning models for different types of cancers. Considering the length of the manuscript, we restrict ourselves to the discussion of breast cancer, lung cancer, brain cancer, and skin cancer. The purpose of this bibliographic review is to provide researchers opting to work in implementing deep learning and artificial neural networks for cancer diagnosis a knowledge from scratch of the state-of-the-art achievements."
2015,Twitter Social Media is an Effective Tool for Breast Cancer Patient Education and Support: Patient-Reported Outcomes by Survey,"Background Despite reported benefits, many women do not attend breast cancer support groups. Abundant online resources for support exist, but information regarding the effectiveness of participation is lacking. We report the results of a Twitter breast cancer support community participant survey. Objective The aim was to determine the effectiveness of social media as a tool for breast cancer patient education and decreasing anxiety. Methods The Breast Cancer Social Media Twitter support community (#BCSM) began in July 2011. Institutional review board approval with a waiver of informed consent was obtained for a deidentified survey that was posted for 2 weeks on Twitter and on the #BCSM blog and Facebook page. Results There were 206 respondents to the survey. In all, 92.7% (191/206) were female. Respondents reported increased knowledge about breast cancer in the following domains: overall knowledge (80.9%, 153/189), survivorship (85.7%, 162/189), metastatic breast cancer (79.4%, 150/189), cancer types and biology (70.9%, 134/189), clinical trials and research (66.1%, 125/189), treatment options (55.6%, 105/189), breast imaging (56.6%, 107/189), genetic testing and risk assessment (53.9%, 102/189), and radiotherapy (43.4%, 82/189). Participation led 31.2% (59/189) to seek a second opinion or bring additional information to the attention of their treatment team and 71.9% (136/189) reported plans to increase their outreach and advocacy efforts as a result of participation. Levels of reported anxiety before and after participation were analyzed: 29 of 43 (67%) patients who initially reported “high or extreme” anxiety reported “low or no” anxiety after participation (P<.001). Also, no patients initially reporting low or no anxiety before participation reported an increase to high or extreme anxiety after participation. Conclusions This study demonstrates that breast cancer patients’ perceived knowledge increases and their anxiety decreases by participation in a Twitter social media support group."
2019,Exosomes from M1-Polarized Macrophages Enhance Paclitaxel Antitumor Activity by Activating Macrophages-Mediated Inflammation,"Objective: Exosomes (Exos) are membrane-encased vesicles derived by nearly all cell types for intercellular communication and regulation. They also received attention for their use as natural therapeutic platforms and drug delivery system. Classically activated M1 macrophages suppress tumor growth by releasing pro-inflammatory factors. This study investigated the suitability of M1-exosomes (M1-Exos) as drug carrier and their effect on the NF-κB signal pathway and further detected whether macrophages repolarization can potentiate the antitumor activities of chemotherapeutics. Methods: M1-Exos were isolated from M1-macrophages by ultracentrifugation and characterized by transmission electron, nanoparticle tracking analysis, dynamic light scattering and western blot. Then M1-Exos were used as Paclitaxel (PTX) carriers to prepare a nano-formulation (PTX- M1-Exos). A relatively simple slight sonication method was used to prepare the drug delivery system (PTX-M1-Exos). The cytotoxicity of PTX-M1-Exos on cancer cells was detected by MTT and flow cytometry in vitro. 4T1 tumor bearing mice were used to perform the therapeutic effect of PTX-M1-Exos in vivo. Results: The expression of caspase-3 in breast cancer cells was increased when co-incubated with macrophages in the presence of M1-Exos in vitro. The production of pro-inflammatory cytokines was increased after exposure of macrophages in M1-Exos. M1-Exos provided a pro-inflammatory environment which enhanced the anti-tumor activity via caspase-3 mediated pathway. The treatment of M1-Exos to the tumor bearing mice exhibit anti-tumor effects in vivo. Meanwhile, the treatment of PTX-M1-Exos demonstrated higher anti-tumor effects than the M1-Exos or PTX group. Conclusion: The results in our study indicate that the M1-Exos act as the carrier to deliver PTX into the tumor tissues, and also enhance the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapeutics in tumor bearing mice."
2022,Global Increase in Breast Cancer Incidence: Risk Factors and Preventive Measures,"Breast cancer is a global cause for concern owing to its high incidence around the world. The alarming increase in breast cancer cases emphasizes the management of disease at multiple levels. The management should start from the beginning that includes stringent cancer screening or cancer registry to effective diagnostic and treatment strategies. Breast cancer is highly heterogeneous at morphology as well as molecular levels and needs different therapeutic regimens based on the molecular subtype. Breast cancer patients with respective subtype have different clinical outcome prognoses. Breast cancer heterogeneity emphasizes the advanced molecular testing that will help on-time diagnosis and improved survival. Emerging fields such as liquid biopsy and artificial intelligence would help to under the complexity of breast cancer disease and decide the therapeutic regimen that helps in breast cancer management. In this review, we have discussed various risk factors and advanced technology available for breast cancer diagnosis to combat the worst breast cancer status and areas that need to be focused for the better management of breast cancer."
2017,Melatonin for the prevention and treatment of cancer,"The epidemiological studies have indicated a possible oncostatic property of melatonin on different types of tumors. Besides, experimental studies have documented that melatonin could exert growth inhibition on some human tumor cells in vitro and in animal models. The underlying mechanisms include antioxidant activity, modulation of melatonin receptors MT1 and MT2, stimulation of apoptosis, regulation of pro-survival signaling and tumor metabolism, inhibition on angiogenesis, metastasis, and induction of epigenetic alteration. Melatonin could also be utilized as adjuvant of cancer therapies, through reinforcing the therapeutic effects and reducing the side effects of chemotherapies or radiation. Melatonin could be an excellent candidate for the prevention and treatment of several cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, gastric cancer and colorectal cancer. This review summarized the anticancer efficacy of melatonin, based on the results of epidemiological,experimental and clinical studies, and special attention was paid to the mechanisms of action."
2018,Classification of Breast Cancer Based on Histology Images Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"In recent years, the classification of breast cancer has been the topic of interest in the field of Healthcare informatics, because it is the second main cause of cancer-related deaths in women. Breast cancer can be identified using a biopsy where tissue is removed and studied under microscope. The diagnosis is based on the qualification of the histopathologist, who will look for abnormal cells. However, if the histopathologist is not well-trained, this may lead to wrong diagnosis. With the recent advances in image processing and machine learning, there is an interest in attempting to develop a reliable pattern recognition based systems to improve the quality of diagnosis. In this paper, we compare two machine learning approaches for the automatic classification of breast cancer histology images into benign and malignant and into benign and malignant sub-classes. The first approach is based on the extraction of a set of handcrafted features encoded by two coding models (bag of words and locality constrained linear coding) and trained by support vector machines, while the second approach is based on the design of convolutional neural networks. We have also experimentally tested dataset augmentation techniques to enhance the accuracy of the convolutional neural network as well as “handcrafted features + convolutional neural network” and “ convolutional neural network features + classifier” configurations. The results show convolutional neural networks outperformed the handcrafted feature based classifier, where we achieved accuracy between 96.15% and 98.33% for the binary classification and 83.31% and 88.23% for the multi-class classification."
2019,Adam Optimization Algorithm for Wide and Deep Neural Network,"The objective of this research is to evaluate the effects of Adam when used together with a wide and deep neural network. The dataset used was a diagnostic breast cancer dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning. Then, the dataset was fed into a conventional neural network for a benchmark test. Afterwards, the dataset was fed into the wide and deep neural network with and without Adam. It was found that there were improvements in the result of the wide and deep network with Adam. In conclusion, Adam is able to improve the performance of a wide and deep neural network."
2020,Artificial intelligence as the next step towards precision pathology,"Pathology is the cornerstone of cancer care. The need for accuracy in histopathologic diagnosis of cancer is increasing as personalized cancer therapy requires accurate biomarker assessment. The appearance of digital image analysis holds promise to improve both the volume and precision of histomorphological evaluation. Recently, machine learning, and particularly deep learning, has enabled rapid advances in computational pathology. The integration of machine learning into routine care will be a milestone for the healthcare sector in the next decade, and histopathology is right at the centre of this revolution. Examples of potential high‐value machine learning applications include both model‐based assessment of routine diagnostic features in pathology, and the ability to extract and identify novel features that provide insights into a disease. Recent groundbreaking results have demonstrated that applications of machine learning methods in pathology significantly improves metastases detection in lymph nodes, Ki67 scoring in breast cancer, Gleason grading in prostate cancer and tumour‐infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) scoring in melanoma. Furthermore, deep learning models have also been demonstrated to be able to predict status of some molecular markers in lung, prostate, gastric and colorectal cancer based on standard HE slides. Moreover, prognostic (survival outcomes) deep neural network models based on digitized HE slides have been demonstrated in several diseases, including lung cancer, melanoma and glioma. In this review, we aim to present and summarize the latest developments in digital image analysis and in the application of artificial intelligence in diagnostic pathology."
2018,"Cannabis sativa L. and Nonpsychoactive Cannabinoids: Their Chemistry and Role against Oxidative Stress, Inflammation, and Cancer","In the last decades, a lot of attention has been paid to the compounds present in medicinal Cannabis sativa L., such as Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC) and cannabidiol (CBD), and their effects on inflammation and cancer-related pain. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) currently recognizes medicinal C. sativa as an effective treatment for providing relief in a number of symptoms associated with cancer, including pain, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, and anxiety. Several studies have described CBD as a multitarget molecule, acting as an adaptogen, and as a modulator, in different ways, depending on the type and location of disequilibrium both in the brain and in the body, mainly interacting with specific receptor proteins CB1 and CB2. CBD is present in both medicinal and fibre-type C. sativa plants, but, unlike Δ9-THC, it is completely nonpsychoactive. Fibre-type C. sativa (hemp) differs from medicinal C. sativa, since it contains only few levels of Δ9-THC and high levels of CBD and related nonpsychoactive compounds. In recent years, a number of preclinical researches have been focused on the role of CBD as an anticancer molecule, suggesting CBD (and CBD-like molecules present in the hemp extract) as a possible candidate for future clinical trials. CBD has been found to possess antioxidant activity in many studies, thus suggesting a possible role in the prevention of both neurodegenerative and cardiovascular diseases. In animal models, CBD has been shown to inhibit the progression of several cancer types. Moreover, it has been found that coadministration of CBD and Δ9-THC, followed by radiation therapy, causes an increase of autophagy and apoptosis in cancer cells. In addition, CBD is able to inhibit cell proliferation and to increase apoptosis in different types of cancer models. These activities seem to involve also alternative pathways, such as the interactions with TRPV and GRP55 receptor complexes. Moreover, the finding that the acidic precursor of CBD (cannabidiolic acid, CBDA) is able to inhibit the migration of breast cancer cells and to downregulate the proto-oncogene c-fos and the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) highlights the possibility that CBDA might act on a common pathway of inflammation and cancer mechanisms, which might be responsible for its anticancer activity. In the light of all these findings, in this review we explore the effects and the molecular mechanisms of CBD on inflammation and cancer processes, highlighting also the role of minor cannabinoids and noncannabinoids constituents of Δ9-THC deprived hemp."
2018,Artificial Intelligence-Based Breast Cancer Nodal Metastasis Detection: Insights Into the Black Box for Pathologists.,"CONTEXT.— Nodal metastasis of a primary tumor influences therapy decisions for a variety of cancers. Histologic identification of tumor cells in lymph nodes can be laborious and error-prone, especially for small tumor foci. OBJECTIVE.— To evaluate the application and clinical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning-based artificial intelligence algorithm (LYmph Node Assistant or LYNA) for detection of metastatic breast cancer in sentinel lymph node biopsies. DESIGN.— Whole slide images were obtained from hematoxylin-eosin-stained lymph nodes from 399 patients (publicly available Camelyon16 challenge dataset). LYNA was developed by using 270 slides and evaluated on the remaining 129 slides. We compared the findings to those obtained from an independent laboratory (108 slides from 20 patients/86 blocks) using a different scanner to measure reproducibility. RESULTS.— LYNA achieved a slide-level area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) of 99% and a tumor-level sensitivity of 91% at 1 false positive per patient on the Camelyon16 evaluation dataset. We also identified 2 ""normal"" slides that contained micrometastases. When applied to our second dataset, LYNA achieved an AUC of 99.6%. LYNA was not affected by common histology artifacts such as overfixation, poor staining, and air bubbles. CONCLUSIONS.— Artificial intelligence algorithms can exhaustively evaluate every tissue patch on a slide, achieving higher tumor-level sensitivity than, and comparable slide-level performance to, pathologists. These techniques may improve the pathologist's productivity and reduce the number of false negatives associated with morphologic detection of tumor cells. We provide a framework to aid practicing pathologists in assessing such algorithms for adoption into their workflow (akin to how a pathologist assesses immunohistochemistry results)."
2017,A Deep Learning Approach for Cancer Detection and Relevant Gene Identification,"Cancer detection from gene expression data continues to pose a challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of these data. After decades of research there is still uncertainty in the clinical diagnosis of cancer and the identification of tumor-specific markers. Here we present a deep learning approach to cancer detection, and to the identification of genes critical for the diagnosis of breast cancer. First, we used Stacked Denoising Autoencoder (SDAE) to deeply extract functional features from high dimensional gene expression profiles. Next, we evaluated the performance of the extracted representation through supervised classification models to verify the usefulness of the new features in cancer detection. Lastly, we identified a set of highly interactive genes by analyzing the SDAE connectivity matrices. Our results and analysis illustrate that these highly interactive genes could be useful cancer biomarkers for the detection of breast cancer that deserve further studies."
2017,SVM and SVM Ensembles in Breast Cancer Prediction,"Breast cancer is an all too common disease in women, making how to effectively predict it an active research problem. A number of statistical and machine learning techniques have been employed to develop various breast cancer prediction models. Among them, support vector machines (SVM) have been shown to outperform many related techniques. To construct the SVM classifier, it is first necessary to decide the kernel function, and different kernel functions can result in different prediction performance. However, there have been very few studies focused on examining the prediction performances of SVM based on different kernel functions. Moreover, it is unknown whether SVM classifier ensembles which have been proposed to improve the performance of single classifiers can outperform single SVM classifiers in terms of breast cancer prediction. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to fully assess the prediction performance of SVM and SVM ensembles over small and large scale breast cancer datasets. The classification accuracy, ROC, F-measure, and computational times of training SVM and SVM ensembles are compared. The experimental results show that linear kernel based SVM ensembles based on the bagging method and RBF kernel based SVM ensembles with the boosting method can be the better choices for a small scale dataset, where feature selection should be performed in the data pre-processing stage. For a large scale dataset, RBF kernel based SVM ensembles based on boosting perform better than the other classifiers."
2017,Deep Learning in Mammography: Diagnostic Accuracy of a Multipurpose Image Analysis Software in the Detection of Breast Cancer,"Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a multipurpose image analysis software based on deep learning with artificial neural networks for the detection of breast cancer in an independent, dual-center mammography data set. Materials and Methods In this retrospective, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act-compliant study, all patients undergoing mammography in 2012 at our institution were reviewed (n = 3228). All of their prior and follow-up mammographies from a time span of 7 years (2008–2015) were considered as a reference for clinical diagnosis. After applying exclusion criteria (missing reference standard, prior procedures or therapies), patients with the first diagnosis of a malignoma or borderline lesion were selected (n = 143). Histology or clinical long-term follow-up served as reference standard. In a first step, a breast density-and age-matched control cohort was selected (n = 143) from the remaining patients with more than 2 years follow-up (n = 1003). The neural network was trained with this data set. From the publicly available Breast Cancer Digital Repository data set, patients with cancer and a matched control cohort were selected (n = 35 × 2). The performance of the trained neural network was also tested with this external data set. Three radiologists (3, 5, and 10 years of experience) evaluated the test data set. In a second step, the neural network was trained with all cases from January to September and tested with cases from October to December 2012 (screening-like cohort). The radiologists also evaluated this second test data set. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve between readers and the neural network were compared. A Bonferroni-corrected P value of less than 0.016 was considered statistically significant. Results Mean age of patients with lesion was 59.6 years (range, 35–88 years) and in controls, 59.1 years (35–83 years). Breast density distribution (A/B/C/D) was 21/59/42/21 and 22/60/41/20, respectively. Histologic diagnoses were invasive ductal carcinoma in 90, ductal in situ carcinoma in 13, invasive lobular carcinoma in 13, mucinous carcinoma in 3, and borderline lesion in 12 patients. In the first step, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the trained neural network was 0.81 and comparable on the test cases 0.79 (P = 0.63). One of the radiologists showed almost equal performance (0.83, P = 0.17), whereas 2 were significantly better (0.91 and 0.94, P < 0.016). In the second step, performance of the neural network (0.82) was not significantly different from the human performance (0.77–0.87, P > 0.016); however, radiologists were consistently less sensitive and more specific than the neural network. Conclusions Current state-of-the-art artificial neural networks for general image analysis are able to detect cancer in mammographies with similar accuracy to radiologists, even in a screening-like cohort with low breast cancer prevalence."
2017,The Health Effects of Aluminum Exposure.,"BACKGROUND Aluminum is regularly taken up with the daily diet. It is also used in antiperspirants, as an adjuvant for vaccination, and in desensitization procedures. In this review, we present the scientifically documented harmful effects of aluminum on health and the threshold values associated with them. METHODS This review is based on publications retrieved by a selective search of the PubMed and SCOPUS databases on the topic of aluminum in connection with neurotoxicity, Alzheimer's disease, and breast cancer, as well as on the authors' personal experience in occupational and environmental medicine. RESULTS The reference values for the internal aluminum load (<15 μg/L in urine, <5 μg/L in serum) are especially likely to be exceeded in persons with occupational exposure. The biological tolerance value for occupational exposure is 50 μg of aluminum per gram of creatinine in the urine. For aluminum welders and workers in the aluminum industry, declining performance in neuropsychological tests (attention, learning, memory) has been found only with aluminum concentrations exceeding 100 μg/g creatinine in the urine; manifest encephalopathy with dementia was not found. Elevated aluminum content has been found in the brains of persons with Alzheimer's disease. It remains unclear whether this is a cause or an effect of the disease. There is conflicting evidence on carcinogenicity. The contention that the use of aluminum-containing antiperspirants promotes breast cancer is not supported by consistent scientific data. CONCLUSION The internal aluminum load is measured in terms of the concentration of aluminum in urine and blood. Keeping these concentrations below the tolerance values prevents the development of manifest and subclinical signs of aluminum toxicity. Large-scale epidemiologic studies of the relationship between aluminum-containing antiperspirants and the risk of breast cancer would be desirable."
2014,Treatment Related Impairments in Arm and Shoulder in Patients with Breast Cancer: A Systematic Review,"Background Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women in the developed world. As a result of breast cancer treatment, many patients suffer from serious complaints in their arm and shoulder, leading to limitations in activities of daily living and participation. In this systematic literature review we present an overview of the adverse effects of the integrated breast cancer treatment related to impairment in functions and structures in the upper extremity and upper body and limitations in daily activities. Patients at highest risk were defined. Methods and Findings We conducted a systematic literature search using the databases of PubMed, Embase, CINAHL and Cochrane from 2000 to October 2012, according to the PRISMA guidelines. Included were studies with patients with stage I–III breast cancer, treated with surgery and additional treatments (radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormonal therapy). The following health outcomes were extracted: reduced joint mobility, reduced muscle strength, pain, lymphedema and limitations in daily activities. Outcomes were divided in within the first 12 months and >12 months post-operatively. Patients treated with ALND are at the highest risk of developing impairments of the arm and shoulder. Reduced ROM and muscle strength, pain, lymphedema and decreased degree of activities in daily living were reported most frequently in relation to ALND. Lumpectomy was related to a decline in the level of activities of daily living. Radiotherapy and hormonal therapy were the main risk factors for pain. Conclusions Patients treated with ALND require special attention to detect and consequently address impairments in the arm and shoulder. Patients with pain should be monitored carefully, because pain limits the degree of daily activities. Future research has to describe a complete overview of the medical treatment and analyze outcome in relation to the treatment. Utilization of uniform validated measurement instruments has to be encouraged."
2018,Staingan: Stain Style Transfer for Digital Histological Images,"Digitized Histological diagnosis is in increasing demand. However, color variations due to various factors are imposing obstacles to the diagnosis process. The problem of stain color variations is a well-defined problem with many proposed solutions. Most of these solutions are highly dependent on a reference template slide. We propose a deep-learning solution inspired by CycleGANs that is trained end-to-end, eliminating the need for an expert to pick a representative reference slide. Our approach showed superior results quantitatively and qualitatively against the state of the art methods (10% improvement visually using SSIM). We further validated our method on a clinical use-case, namely Breast Cancer tumor classification, showing a 12% increase in AUC. The code is made publicly available 1.1https://github.com/xtarx/StainGAN"
2019,The Regulatory Role of MicroRNAs in Breast Cancer,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules which function as critical post-transcriptional gene regulators of various biological functions. Generally, miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression by binding to their selective messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby leading to either mRNA degradation or translational repression, depending on the degree of complementarity with target mRNA sequences. Aberrant expression of these miRNAs has been linked etiologically with various human diseases including breast cancer. Different cellular pathways of breast cancer development such as cell proliferation, apoptotic response, metastasis, cancer recurrence and chemoresistance are regulated by either the oncogenic miRNA (oncomiR) or tumor suppressor miRNA (tsmiR). In this review, we highlight the current state of research into miRNA involved in breast cancer, with particular attention to articles published between the years 2000 to 2019, using detailed searches of the databases PubMed, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The post-transcriptional gene regulatory roles of various dysregulated miRNAs in breast cancer and their potential as therapeutic targets are also discussed."
2019,Targeted exosome‐encapsulated erastin induced ferroptosis in triple negative breast cancer cells,"Ferroptosis is an iron‐dependent, lipid peroxide‐driven cell death caused by inhibition of the cystine/glutamate transporter, which is of importance for the survival of triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells. Erastin is a low molecular weight chemotherapy drug that induces ferroptosis; however, poor water solubility and renal toxicity have limited its application. Exosomes, as drug delivery vehicles with low immunogenicity, high biocompatibility and high efficiency, have attracted increasing attention in recent years. Herein, we developed a formulation of erastin‐loaded exosomes labeled with folate (FA) to form FA‐vectorized exosomes loaded with erastin (erastin@FA‐exo) to target TNBC cells with overexpression of FA receptors. The characterization, drug release, internalization and anti–tumor effect in vitro of erastin@FA‐exo were determined. Erastin@FA‐exo could increase the uptake efficiency of erastin into MDA‐MB‐231 cells; compared with erastin@exo and free erastin, erastin@FA‐exo has a better inhibitory effect on the proliferation and migration of MDA‐MB‐231 cells. Furthermore, erastin@FA‐exo promoted ferroptosis with intracellular depletion of glutathione and reactive oxygen species overgeneration. Western blot analyses revealed that erastin@FA‐exo suppressed expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) and upregulated expression of cysteine dioxygenase (CDO1). We conclude that targeting and biocompatibility of exosome‐based erastin preparations provide an innovative and powerful delivery platform for anti–cancer therapy."
2017,A Population-Based Study of Cardiovascular Mortality Following Early-Stage Breast Cancer,"Importance There is increasing interest in the effect of cardiovascular disease on cancer survivors. However, there are limited contemporary population-based data on the risk of cardiovascular death after early-stage breast cancer. Objective To describe the incidence of cardiovascular death in a contemporary population of women with early-stage breast cancer while accounting for competing risks. Design, Setting, and Participants A population-based cohort study was conducted among 98 999 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer between April 1, 1998, and March 31, 2012. Patients were followed up until death or were censored on December 31, 2013. Baseline characteristics were determined from administrative databases and the Ontario Cancer registry. Vital statistics data were used to determine the cause of death. Cumulative incidence functions were used to estimate the incidence of cause-specific mortality. We studied the association between baseline characteristics and rates of cardiovascular death using cause-specific hazard functions. The analyses accounted for competing risks of noncardiovascular death. Statistical analysis was performed from July 16, 2015, to August 4, 2016. Exposures Early-stage breast cancer, age, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes. Main Outcomes and Measures Cause of death, which was classified as breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, other cancers, or other noncancer causes. Results Of the 98 999 women (median age, 60 years [interquartile range, 50-71 years]) in the study, 21 123 (21.3%) died during follow-up. The median time to death was 4.2 years (IQR, 2.2-7.1 years). Breast cancer was the most common cause of death (10 550 deaths [49.9%]); 3444 deaths [16.3%] were from cardiovascular causes. Cardiovascular death was infrequent in women younger than 66 years without prior cardiovascular disease, diabetes, or hypertension. Among women 66 years or older, the risks of breast cancer death and cardiovascular death at 10 years were 11.9% (95% CI, 11.6%-12.3%) and 7.6% (95% CI, 7.3%-7.9%), respectively. Among patients with prior cardiovascular disease, the risk of death from breast cancer and cardiovascular disease were equivalent for the first 5 years, after which death from cardiovascular causes was more frequent (10-year cumulative incidence, 14.6% [95% CI, 13.7%-15.4%] for breast cancer vs 16.9% [95% CI, 16.0%-17.8%] for cardiovascular disease). For women 66 years or older who survived 5 years or more after diagnosis of breast cancer, cardiovascular disease exceeded breast cancer as the leading cause of death at 10 years after diagnosis, when the cumulative incidence of each was 5%. Conclusions and Relevance Cardiovascular death is an important competing risk for older women with early-stage breast cancer. This finding mandates adequate attention to cardiovascular preventive therapy after diagnosis of breast cancer."
2017,Targeted therapies in breast cancer: New challenges to fight against resistance,"Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer found in women and today represents a significant challenge to public health. With the latest breakthroughs in molecular biology and immunotherapy, very specific targeted therapies have been tailored to the specific pathophysiology of different types of breast cancers. These recent developments have contributed to a more efficient and specific treatment protocol in breast cancer patients. However, the main challenge to be further investigated still remains the emergence of therapeutic resistance mechanisms, which develop soon after the onset of therapy and need urgent attention and further elucidation. What are the recent emerging molecular resistance mechanisms in breast cancer targeted therapy and what are the best strategies to apply in order to circumvent this important obstacle? The main scope of this review is to provide a thorough update of recent developments in the field and discuss future prospects for preventing resistance mechanisms in the quest to increase overall survival of patients suffering from the disease."
2018,Watson for Oncology and breast cancer treatment recommendations: agreement with an expert multidisciplinary tumor board,"Background Breast cancer oncologists are challenged to personalize care with rapidly changing scientific evidence, drug approvals, and treatment guidelines. Artificial intelligence (AI) clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) have the potential to help address this challenge. We report here the results of examining the level of agreement (concordance) between treatment recommendations made by the AI CDSS Watson for Oncology (WFO) and a multidisciplinary tumor board for breast cancer. Patients and methods Treatment recommendations were provided for 638 breast cancers between 2014 and 2016 at the Manipal Comprehensive Cancer Center, Bengaluru, India. WFO provided treatment recommendations for the identical cases in 2016. A blinded second review was carried out by the center's tumor board in 2016 for all cases in which there was not agreement, to account for treatments and guidelines not available before 2016. Treatment recommendations were considered concordant if the tumor board recommendations were designated 'recommended' or 'for consideration' by WFO. Results Treatment concordance between WFO and the multidisciplinary tumor board occurred in 93% of breast cancer cases. Subgroup analysis found that patients with stage I or IV disease were less likely to be concordant than patients with stage II or III disease. Increasing age was found to have a major impact on concordance. Concordance declined significantly (P ≤ 0.02; P < 0.001) in all age groups compared with patients <45 years of age, except for the age group 55-64 years. Receptor status was not found to affect concordance. Conclusion Treatment recommendations made by WFO and the tumor board were highly concordant for breast cancer cases examined. Breast cancer stage and patient age had significant influence on concordance, while receptor status alone did not. This study demonstrates that the AI clinical decision-support system WFO may be a helpful tool for breast cancer treatment decision making, especially at centers where expert breast cancer resources are limited."
2017,Early Diagnosis of Breast Cancer,"Early-stage cancer detection could reduce breast cancer death rates significantly in the long-term. The most critical point for best prognosis is to identify early-stage cancer cells. Investigators have studied many breast diagnostic approaches, including mammography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, computerized tomography, positron emission tomography and biopsy. However, these techniques have some limitations such as being expensive, time consuming and not suitable for young women. Developing a high-sensitive and rapid early-stage breast cancer diagnostic method is urgent. In recent years, investigators have paid their attention in the development of biosensors to detect breast cancer using different biomarkers. Apart from biosensors and biomarkers, microwave imaging techniques have also been intensely studied as a promising diagnostic tool for rapid and cost-effective early-stage breast cancer detection. This paper aims to provide an overview on recent important achievements in breast screening methods (particularly on microwave imaging) and breast biomarkers along with biosensors for rapidly diagnosing breast cancer."
2014,Delay in Breast Cancer: Implications for Stage at Diagnosis and Survival,"Breast cancer continues to be a disease with tremendous public health significance. Primary prevention of breast cancer is still not available, so efforts to promote early detection continue to be the major focus in fighting breast cancer. Since early detection is associated with decreased mortality, one would think that it is important to minimize delays in detection and diagnosis. There are two major types of delay. Patient delay is delay in seeking medical attention after self-discovering a potential breast cancer symptom. System delay is delay within the health care system in getting appointments, scheduling diagnostic tests, receiving a definitive diagnosis, and initiating therapy. Earlier studies of the consequences of delay on prognosis tended to show that increased delay is associated with more advanced stage cancers at diagnosis, thus resulting in poorer chances for survival. More recent studies have had mixed results, with some studies showing increased survival with longer delays. One hypothesis is that diagnostic difficulties could perhaps account for this survival paradox. A rapidly growing lump may suggest cancer to both doctors and patients, while a slow growing lump or other symptoms could be less obvious to them. If this is the case, then the shorter delays would be seen with the more aggressive tumors for which the prognosis is worse leading to reduced survival. It seems logical that a tumor that is more advanced at diagnosis would lead to shorter survival but the several counter-intuitive studies in this review show that it is dangerous to make assumptions."
2020,CRISPR-Cas12a-Based Nucleic Acid Amplification-Free DNA Biosensor via Au Nanoparticle-Assisted Metal-Enhanced Fluorescence and Colorimetric Analysis.,"Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) has attracted significant attention due to its high potential to diagnose diseases, such as cancer. Still, its detection by amplification method has limitations because of false-positive signals and difficulty in designing target-specific primers. CRISPR-Cas-based fluorescent biosensors have been developed but also need the amplification step for the detection. In this study, for the first time CRISPR-Cas12a based nucleic acid amplification-free fluorescent biosensor was developed to detect cfDNA by a metal-enhanced fluorescence (MEF) using DNA-functionalized Au nanoparticle (AuNP). Upon activating the CRISPR-Cas12a complex by the target cfDNA and subsequent single-strand DNA (ssDNA) degradation between AuNP and fluorophore, MEF occurred with color changes from purple to red-purple. Using this system, breast cancer gene-1 (BRCA-1) can be detected with very high sensitivity in 30 min. This rapid and highly selective sensor can be applied to measure other nucleic acid biomarkers such as viral DNA in field-deployable and point-of-care testing (POCT) platform."
2019,Lymph Node Metastasis Prediction from Primary Breast Cancer US Images Using Deep Learning.,"Background Deep learning (DL) algorithms are gaining extensive attention for their excellent performance in image recognition tasks. DL models can automatically make a quantitative assessment of complex medical image characteristics and achieve increased accuracy in diagnosis with higher efficiency. Purpose To determine the feasibility of using a DL approach to predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis from US images in patients with primary breast cancer. Materials and Methods A data set of US images in patients with primary breast cancer with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes from Tongji Hospital (974 imaging studies from 2016 to 2018, 756 patients) and an independent test set from Hubei Cancer Hospital (81 imaging studies from 2018 to 2019, 78 patients) were collected. Axillary lymph node status was confirmed with pathologic examination. Three different convolutional neural networks (CNNs) of Inception V3, Inception-ResNet V2, and ResNet-101 architectures were trained on 90% of the Tongji Hospital data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as on the independent test set. The performance of the models was compared with that of five radiologists. The models' performance was analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic curves, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs), and heat maps. Results The best-performing CNN model, Inception V3, achieved an AUC of 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83, 0.95) in the prediction of the final clinical diagnosis of axillary lymph node metastasis in the independent test set. The model achieved 85% sensitivity (35 of 41 images; 95% CI: 70%, 94%) and 73% specificity (29 of 40 images; 95% CI: 56%, 85%), and the radiologists achieved 73% sensitivity (30 of 41 images; 95% CI: 57%, 85%; P = .17) and 63% specificity (25 of 40 images; 95% CI: 46%, 77%; P = .34). Conclusion Using US images from patients with primary breast cancer, deep learning models can effectively predict clinically negative axillary lymph node metastasis. Artificial intelligence may provide an early diagnostic strategy for lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer with clinically negative lymph nodes. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license.

2014,Covalent functionalization of graphene oxide with biocompatible poly(ethylene glycol) for delivery of paclitaxel.,"Graphene oxide (GO), a novel 2D nanomaterial prepared by the oxidation of natural graphite, has been paid much attention in the area of drug delivery due to good biocompatibility and low toxicity. In the present work, 6-armed poly(ethylene glycol) was covalently introduced into the surface of GO sheets via a facile amidation process under mild conditions, making the modified GO, GO-PEG (PEG: 65 wt %, size: 50-200 nm), stable and biocompatible in physiological solution. This nanosized GO-PEG was found to be nontoxic to human lung cancer A549 and human breast cancer MCF-7 cells via cell viability assay. Furthermore, paclitaxel (PTX), a widely used cancer chemotherapy drug, was conjugated onto GO-PEG via π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions to afford a nanocomplex of GO-PEG/PTX with a relatively high loading capacity for PTX (11.2 wt %). This complex could quickly enter into A549 and MCF-7 cells evidenced by inverted fluorescence microscopy using Fluorescein isothiocyanate as a probe, and it also showed remarkably high cytotoxicity to A549 and MCF-7 cells in a broad range of concentration of PTX and time compared to free PTX. This kind of nanoscale drug delivery system on the basis of PEGylated GO may find potential application in biomedicine."
2018,Breast cancer classification using machine learning,"During their life, among 8% of women are diagnosed with Breast cancer (BC), after lung cancer, BC is the second popular cause of death in both developed and undeveloped worlds. BC is characterized by the mutation of genes, constant pain, changes in the size, color(redness), skin texture of breasts. Classification of breast cancer leads pathologists to find a systematic and objective prognostic, generally the most frequent classification is binary (benign cancer/malign cancer). Today, Machine Learning (ML) techniques are being broadly used in the breast cancer classification problem. They provide high classification accuracy and effective diagnostic capabilities. In this paper, we present two different classifiers: Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and knearest neighbor (KNN) for breast cancer classification. We propose a comparison between the two new implementations and evaluate their accuracy using cross validation. Results show that KNN gives the highest accuracy (97.51%) with lowest error rate then NB classifier (96.19 %)."
2018,A deep learning method for classifying mammographic breast density categories,"PURPOSE Mammographic breast density is an established risk marker for breast cancer and is visually assessed by radiologists in routine mammogram image reading, using four qualitative Breast Imaging and Reporting Data System (BI-RADS) breast density categories. It is particularly difficult for radiologists to consistently distinguish the two most common and most variably assigned BI-RADS categories, i.e., ""scattered density"" and ""heterogeneously dense"". The aim of this work was to investigate a deep learning-based breast density classifier to consistently distinguish these two categories, aiming at providing a potential computerized tool to assist radiologists in assigning a BI-RADS category in current clinical workflow. METHODS In this study, we constructed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based model coupled with a large (i.e., 22,000 images) digital mammogram imaging dataset to evaluate the classification performance between the two aforementioned breast density categories. All images were collected from a cohort of 1,427 women who underwent standard digital mammography screening from 2005 to 2016 at our institution. The truths of the density categories were based on standard clinical assessment made by board-certified breast imaging radiologists. Effects of direct training from scratch solely using digital mammogram images and transfer learning of a pretrained model on a large nonmedical imaging dataset were evaluated for the specific task of breast density classification. In order to measure the classification performance, the CNN classifier was also tested on a refined version of the mammogram image dataset by removing some potentially inaccurately labeled images. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to measure the accuracy of the classifier. RESULTS The AUC was 0.9421 when the CNN-model was trained from scratch on our own mammogram images, and the accuracy increased gradually along with an increased size of training samples. Using the pretrained model followed by a fine-tuning process with as few as 500 mammogram images led to an AUC of 0.9265. After removing the potentially inaccurately labeled images, AUC was increased to 0.9882 and 0.9857 for without and with the pretrained model, respectively, both significantly higher (P < 0.001) than when using the full imaging dataset. CONCLUSIONS Our study demonstrated high classification accuracies between two difficult to distinguish breast density categories that are routinely assessed by radiologists. We anticipate that our approach will help enhance current clinical assessment of breast density and better support consistent density notification to patients in breast cancer screening."
2019,A Multimodal Deep Neural Network for Human Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction by Integrating Multi-Dimensional Data,"Breast cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer with very low median survival. Accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer can spare a significant number of patients from receiving unnecessary adjuvant systemic treatment and its related expensive medical costs. Previous work relies mostly on selected gene expression data to create a predictive model. The emergence of deep learning methods and multi-dimensional data offers opportunities for more comprehensive analysis of the molecular characteristics of breast cancer and therefore can improve diagnosis, treatment, and prevention. In this study, we propose a Multimodal Deep Neural Network by integrating Multi-dimensional Data (MDNNMD) for the prognosis prediction of breast cancer. The novelty of the method lies in the design of our method's architecture and the fusion of multi-dimensional data. The comprehensive performance evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves a better performance than the prediction methods with single-dimensional data and other existing approaches. The source code implemented by TensorFlow 1.0 deep learning library can be downloaded from the Github: https://github.com/USTC-HIlab/MDNNMD."
2017,On breast cancer detection: an application of machine learning algorithms on the wisconsin diagnostic dataset,"This paper presents a comparison of six machine learning (ML) algorithms: GRU-SVM[1], Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Nearest Neighbor (NN) search, Softmax Regression, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset[2] by measuring their classification test accuracy, and their sensitivity and specificity values. The said dataset consists of features which were computed from digitized images of FNA tests on a breast mass[2]. For the implementation of the ML algorithms, the dataset was partitioned in the following fashion: 70% for training phase, and 30% for the testing phase. The hyper-parameters used for all the classifiers were manually assigned. Results show that all the presented ML algorithms performed well (all exceeded 90% test accuracy) on the classification task. The MLP algorithm stands out among the implemented algorithms with a test accuracy of ≈99.04%."
2020,using Deep Learning,"In modern globe, medical image analysis significantly participates in diagnosis process. In general, it involves five processes, such as medical image classification, medical image detection, medical image segmentation, medical image registration, and medical image localization. Medical imaging uses in diagnosis process for most of the human body organs, such as brain tumor, chest, breast, colonoscopy, retinal, and many other cases relate to medical image analysis using various modalities. Multi-modality images include magnetic resonance imaging, single photon emission computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography, optical coherence tomography, confocal laser endoscopy, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, CT, X-ray, wireless capsule endoscopy, breast cancer, papanicolaou smear, hyper spectral image, and ultrasound use to diagnose different body organs and cases. Medical image analysis is appropriate environment to interact with automate intelligent system technologies. Among the intelligent systems deep learning (DL) is the modern one to manipulate medical image analysis processes and processing an image into fundamental components to extract meaningful information. The best model to establish its systems is deep convolutional neural network. This study relied on reviewing of some of these studies because of these reasons; improvements of medical imaging increase demand on automate systems of medical image analysis using DL, in most tested cases, accuracy of intelligent methods especially DL methods higher than accuracy of hand-crafted works. Furthermore, manually works need a lot of time compare to systematic diagnosis."
2017,Fatty acid synthase (FASN) as a therapeutic target in breast cancer,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Ten years ago, we put forward the metabolo-oncogenic nature of fatty acid synthase (FASN) in breast cancer. Since the conception of this hypothesis, which provided a model to explain how FASN is intertwined with various signaling networks to cell-autonomously regulate breast cancer initiation and progression, FASN has received considerable attention as a therapeutic target. However, despite the ever-growing evidence demonstrating the involvement of FASN as part of the cancer-associated metabolic reprogramming, translation of the basic science-discovery aspects of FASN blockade to the clinical arena remains a challenge. Areas covered: Ten years later, we herein review the preclinical lessons learned from the pharmaceutical liabilities of the first generation of FASN inhibitors. We provide an updated view of the current development and clinical testing of next generation FASN-targeted drugs. We also discuss new clinico-molecular approaches that should help us to convert roadblocks into roadways that will propel forward our therapeutic understanding of FASN. Expert opinion: With the recent demonstration of target engagement and early signs of clinical activity with the first orally available, selective, potent and reversible FASN inhibitor, we can expect Big pharma to revitalize their interest in lipogenic enzymes as well-credentialed targets for oncology drug development in breast cancer."
2018,Machine Learning with Applications in Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today’s society. The early diagnosis of BC can improve the prognosis and chance of survival significantly, as it can promote timely clinical treatment to patients. Further accurate classification of benign tumours can prevent patients undergoing unnecessary treatments. Thus, the correct diagnosis of BC and classification of patients into malignant or benign groups is the subject of much research. Because of its unique advantages in critical features detection from complex BC datasets, machine learning (ML) is widely recognised as the methodology of choice in BC pattern classification and forecast modelling. In this paper, we aim to review ML techniques and their applications in BC diagnosis and prognosis. Firstly, we provide an overview of ML techniques including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), decision trees (DTs), and k-nearest neighbors (k-NNs). Then, we investigate their applications in BC. Our primary data is drawn from the Wisconsin breast cancer database (WBCD) which is the benchmark database for comparing the results through different algorithms. Finally, a healthcare system model of our recent work is also shown."
2017,High-Resolution Breast Cancer Screening with Multi-View Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"Advances in deep learning for natural images have prompted a surge of interest in applying similar techniques to medical images. The majority of the initial attempts focused on replacing the input of a deep convolutional neural network with a medical image, which does not take into consideration the fundamental differences between these two types of images. Specifically, fine details are necessary for detection in medical images, unlike in natural images where coarse structures matter most. This difference makes it inadequate to use the existing network architectures developed for natural images, because they work on heavily downscaled images to reduce the memory requirements. This hides details necessary to make accurate predictions. Additionally, a single exam in medical imaging often comes with a set of views which must be fused in order to reach a correct conclusion. In our work, we propose to use a multi-view deep convolutional neural network that handles a set of high-resolution medical images. We evaluate it on large-scale mammography-based breast cancer screening (BI-RADS prediction) using 886,000 images. We focus on investigating the impact of the training set size and image size on the prediction accuracy. Our results highlight that performance increases with the size of training set, and that the best performance can only be achieved using the original resolution. In the reader study, performed on a random subset of the test set, we confirmed the efficacy of our model, which achieved performance comparable to a committee of radiologists when presented with the same data."
2020,Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Review of Conventional and Advanced Therapeutic Strategies,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells are deficient in estrogen, progesterone and ERBB2 receptor expression, presenting a particularly challenging therapeutic target due to their highly invasive nature and relatively low response to therapeutics. There is an absence of specific treatment strategies for this tumor subgroup, and hence TNBC is managed with conventional therapeutics, often leading to systemic relapse. In terms of histology and transcription profile these cancers have similarities to BRCA-1-linked breast cancers, and it is hypothesized that BRCA1 pathway is non-functional in this type of breast cancer. In this review article, we discuss the different receptors expressed by TNBC as well as the diversity of different signaling pathways targeted by TNBC therapeutics, for example, Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt/b-Catenin as well as TGF-beta signaling pathways. Additionally, many epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors effectively inhibit the TNBCs, but they face challenges of either resistance to drugs or relapse. The resistance of TNBC to conventional therapeutic agents has helped in the advancement of advanced TNBC therapeutic approaches including hyperthermia, photodynamic therapy, as well as nanomedicine-based targeted therapeutics of drugs, miRNA, siRNA, and aptamers, which will also be discussed. Artificial intelligence is another tool that is presented to enhance the diagnosis of TNBC."
2017,Dietary Natural Products for Prevention and Treatment of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among females worldwide. Several epidemiological studies suggested the inverse correlation between the intake of vegetables and fruits and the incidence of breast cancer. Substantial experimental studies indicated that many dietary natural products could affect the development and progression of breast cancer, such as soy, pomegranate, mangosteen, citrus fruits, apple, grape, mango, cruciferous vegetables, ginger, garlic, black cumin, edible macro-fungi, and cereals. Their anti-breast cancer effects involve various mechanisms of action, such as downregulating ER-α expression and activity, inhibiting proliferation, migration, metastasis and angiogenesis of breast tumor cells, inducing apoptosis and cell cycle arrest, and sensitizing breast tumor cells to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This review summarizes the potential role of dietary natural products and their major bioactive components in prevention and treatment of breast cancer, and special attention was paid to the mechanisms of action."
2018,Breast Cancer Detection Using Infrared Thermal Imaging and a Deep Learning Model,"Women’s breasts are susceptible to developing cancer; this is supported by a recent study from 2016 showing that 2.8 million women worldwide had already been diagnosed with breast cancer that year. The medical care of a patient with breast cancer is costly and, given the cost and value of the preservation of the health of the citizen, the prevention of breast cancer has become a priority in public health. Over the past 20 years several techniques have been proposed for this purpose, such as mammography, which is frequently used for breast cancer diagnosis. However, false positives of mammography can occur in which the patient is diagnosed positive by another technique. Additionally, the potential side effects of using mammography may encourage patients and physicians to look for other diagnostic techniques. Our review of the literature first explored infrared digital imaging, which assumes that a basic thermal comparison between a healthy breast and a breast with cancer always shows an increase in thermal activity in the precancerous tissues and the areas surrounding developing breast cancer. Furthermore, through our research, we realized that a Computer-Aided Diagnostic (CAD) undertaken through infrared image processing could not be achieved without a model such as the well-known hemispheric model. The novel contribution of this paper is the production of a comparative study of several breast cancer detection techniques using powerful computer vision techniques and deep learning models."
2021,Contrast-enhanced Mammography: State of the Art.,"Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) has emerged as a viable alternative to contrast-enhanced breast MRI, and it may increase access to vascular imaging while reducing examination cost. Intravenous iodinated contrast materials are used in CEM to enhance the visualization of tumor neovascularity. After injection, imaging is performed with dual-energy digital mammography, which helps provide a low-energy image and a recombined or iodine image that depict enhancing lesions in the breast. CEM has been demonstrated to help improve accuracy compared with digital mammography and US in women with abnormal screening mammographic findings or symptoms of breast cancer. It has also been demonstrated to approach the accuracy of breast MRI in preoperative staging of patients with breast cancer and in monitoring response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. There are early encouraging results from trials evaluating CEM in the screening of women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer. Although CEM is a promising tool, it slightly increases radiation dose and carries a small risk of adverse reactions to contrast materials. This review details the CEM technique, diagnostic and screening uses, and future applications, including artificial intelligence and radiomics."
2014,Physical activity for women with breast cancer after adjuvant therapy.,"BACKGROUND Women with a diagnosis of breast cancer may experience short- and long-term disease and treatment-related adverse physiological and psychosocial outcomes. These outcomes can negatively impact prognosis, health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and psychosocial and physical function. Physical activity may help to improve prognosis and may alleviate the adverse effects of adjuvant therapy. OBJECTIVES To assess effects of physical activity interventions after adjuvant therapy for women with breast cancer. SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Group (CBCG) Specialised Registry, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), the Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro), SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, on 18 September 2015. We also searched OpenGrey and Healthcare Management Information Consortium databases. SELECTION CRITERIA We searched for randomised and quasi-randomised trials comparing physical activity interventions versus control (e.g. usual or standard care, no physical activity, no exercise, attention control, placebo) after adjuvant therapy (i.e. after completion of chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy, but not hormone therapy) in women with breast cancer. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted trial authors to ask for additional information when needed. We calculated an overall effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each outcome and used GRADE to assess the quality of evidence for the most important outcomes. MAIN RESULTS We included 63 trials that randomised 5761 women to a physical activity intervention (n = 3239) or to a control (n = 2524). The duration of interventions ranged from 4 to 24 months, with most lasting 8 or 12 weeks (37 studies). Twenty-eight studies included aerobic exercise only, 21 involved aerobic exercise and resistance training, and seven used resistance training only. Thirty studies described the comparison group as usual or standard care, no intervention, or control. One-fifth of studies reported at least 20% intervention attrition and the average physical activity adherence was approximately 77%.No data were available on effects of physical activity on breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality, or on breast cancer recurrence. Analysis of immediately postintervention follow-up values and change from baseline to end of intervention scores revealed that physical activity interventions resulted in significant small-to-moderate improvements in HRQoL (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.39, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.57, 22 studies, 1996 women; SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.17, 14 studies, 1459 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), emotional function (SMD 0.21, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.32, 26 studies, 2102 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.31, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.53, 15 studies, 1579 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), perceived physical function (SMD 0.33, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.49, 25 studies, 2129 women; SMD 0.60, 95% CI 0.23 to 0.97, 13 studies, 1433 women, respectively; moderate-quality evidence), anxiety (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.19, 7 studies, 326 women; SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12, 4 studies, 235 women, respectively; low-quality evidence), and cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.58, 23 studies, 1265 women, moderate-quality evidence; SMD 0.83, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.27, 9 studies, 863 women, respectively; very low-quality evidence).Investigators reported few minor adverse events.Small improvements in physical activity interventions were sustained for three months or longer postintervention in fatigue (SMD -0.43, 95% CI -0.60 to -0.26; SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.11, respectively), cardiorespiratory fitness (SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.69; SMD 0.42, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.79, respectively), and self-reported physical activity (SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.72; SMD 0.51, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.93, respectively) for both follow-up values and change from baseline scores.However, evidence of heterogeneity across trials was due to variation in intervention components (i.e. mode, frequency, intensity, duration of intervention and sessions) and measures used to assess outcomes. All trials reviewed were at high risk of performance bias, and most were also at high risk of detection, attrition, and selection bias. In light of the aforementioned issues, we determined that the evidence was of very low, low, or moderate quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS No conclusions regarding breast cancer-related and all-cause mortality or breast cancer recurrence were possible. However, physical activity interventions may have small-to-moderate beneficial effects on HRQoL, and on emotional or perceived physical and social function, anxiety, cardiorespiratory fitness, and self-reported and objectively measured physical activity. The positive results reported in the current review must be interpreted cautiously owing to very low-to-moderate quality of evidence, heterogeneity of interventions and outcome measures, imprecision of some estimates, and risk of bias in many trials. Future studies with low risk of bias are required to determine the optimal combination of physical activity modes, frequencies, intensities, and durations needed to improve specific outcomes among women who have undergone adjuvant therapy."
2019,Structured crowdsourcing enables convolutional segmentation of histology images,"Abstract Motivation While deep-learning algorithms have demonstrated outstanding performance in semantic image segmentation tasks, large annotation datasets are needed to create accurate models. Annotation of histology images is challenging due to the effort and experience required to carefully delineate tissue structures, and difficulties related to sharing and markup of whole-slide images. Results We recruited 25 participants, ranging in experience from senior pathologists to medical students, to delineate tissue regions in 151 breast cancer slides using the Digital Slide Archive. Inter-participant discordance was systematically evaluated, revealing low discordance for tumor and stroma, and higher discordance for more subjectively defined or rare tissue classes. Feedback provided by senior participants enabled the generation and curation of 20 000+ annotated tissue regions. Fully convolutional networks trained using these annotations were highly accurate (mean AUC=0.945), and the scale of annotation data provided notable improvements in image classification accuracy. Availability and Implementation Dataset is freely available at: https://goo.gl/cNM4EL. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
2018,Unravelling the Interplay between Extracellular Acidosis and Immune Cells,"The development of an acidic tissue environment is a hallmark of a variety of inflammatory processes and solid tumors. However, little attention has been paid so far to analyze the influence exerted by extracellular pH on the immune response. Tissue acidosis (pH 6.0 to 7.0) is usually associated with the course of infectious processes in peripheral tissues. Moreover, it represents a prominent feature of solid tumors. In fact, values of pH ranging from 5.7 to 7.0 are usually found in a number of solid tumors such as breast cancer, brain tumors, sarcomas, malignant melanoma, squamous cell carcinomas, and adenocarcinomas. Both the innate and adaptive arms of the immune response appear to be finely regulated by extracellular acidosis in the range of pH values found at inflammatory sites and tumors. Low pH has been shown to delay neutrophil apoptosis, promoting their differentiation into a proangiogenic profile. Acting on monocytes and macrophages, it induces the activation of the inflammasome and the production of IL-1β, while the exposure of conventional dendritic cells to low pH promotes the acquisition of a mature phenotype. Overall, these observations suggest that high concentrations of protons could be recognized by innate immune cells as a danger-associated molecular pattern (DAMP). On the other hand, by acting on T lymphocytes, low pH has been shown to suppress the cytotoxic response mediated by CD8+ T cells as well as the production of IFN-γ by TH1 cells. Interestingly, modulation of tumor microenvironment acidity has been shown to be able not only to reverse anergy in human and mouse tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes but also to improve the antitumor immune response induced by checkpoint inhibitors. Here, we provide an integrated view of the influence exerted by low pH on immune cells and discuss its implications in the immune response against infectious agents and tumor cells."
2019,Impact of Machine Learning With Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Breast for Early Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy and Survival Outcomes in Breast Cancer Patients,"PurposeThe aim of this study was to assess the potential of machine learning with multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) for the early prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and of survival outcomes in breast cancer patients. Materials and MethodsThis institutional review board–approved prospective study included 38 women (median age, 46.5 years; range, 25–70 years) with breast cancer who were scheduled for NAC and underwent mpMRI of the breast at 3 T with dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and T2-weighted imaging before and after 2 cycles of NAC. For each lesion, 23 features were extracted: qualitative T2-weighted and DCE-MRI features according to BI-RADS (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System), quantitative pharmacokinetic DCE features (mean plasma flow, volume distribution, mean transit time), and DWI apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values. To apply machine learning to mpMRI, 8 classifiers including linear support vector machine, linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, random forests, stochastic gradient descent, decision tree, adaptive boosting, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were used to rank the features. Histopathologic residual cancer burden (RCB) class (with RCB 0 being a pCR), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS) were used as the standards of reference. Classification accuracy with area under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUC) was assessed using all the extracted qualitative and quantitative features for pCR as defined by RCB class, RFS, and DSS using recursive feature elimination. To overcome overfitting, 4-fold cross-validation was used. ResultsMachine learning with mpMRI achieved stable performance as shown by mean classification accuracies for the prediction of RCB class (AUC, 0.86) and DSS (AUC, 0.92) based on XGBoost and the prediction of RFS (AUC, 0.83) with logistic regression. The XGBoost classifier achieved the most stable performance with high accuracies compared with other classifiers. The most relevant features for the prediction of RCB class were as follows: changes in lesion size, complete pattern of shrinkage, and mean transit time on DCE-MRI; minimum ADC on DWI; and peritumoral edema on T2-weighted imaging. The most relevant features for prediction of RFS were as follows: volume distribution, mean plasma flow, and mean transit time; DCE-MRI lesion size; minimum, maximum, and mean ADC with DWI. The most relevant features for prediction of DSS were as follows: lesion size, volume distribution, and mean plasma flow on DCE-MRI, and maximum ADC with DWI. ConclusionsMachine learning with mpMRI of the breast enables early prediction of pCR to NAC as well as survival outcomes in breast cancer patients with high accuracy and thus may provide valuable predictive information to guide treatment decisions."
2021,A Novel Deep-Learning Model for Automatic Detection and Classification of Breast Cancer Using the Transfer-Learning Technique,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the primary causes of cancer death among women. Early detection of BC allows patients to receive appropriate treatment, thus increasing the possibility of survival. In this work, a new deep-learning (DL) model based on the transfer-learning (TL) technique is developed to efficiently assist in the automatic detection and diagnosis of the BC suspected area based on two techniques namely 80–20 and cross-validation. DL architectures are modeled to be problem-specific. TL uses the knowledge gained during solving one problem in another relevant problem. In the proposed model, the features are extracted from the mammographic image analysis- society (MIAS) dataset using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture such as Inception V3, ResNet50, Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG)-19, VGG-16, and Inception-V2 ResNet. Six evaluation metrics for evaluating the performance of the proposed model in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) has been chosen. Experimental results show that the TL of the VGG16 model is powerful for BC diagnosis by classifying the mammogram breast images with overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F-score, and AUC of 98.96%, 97.83%, 99.13%, 97.35%, 97.66%, and 0.995, respectively for 80–20 method and 98.87%, 97.27%, 98.2%, 98.84%, 98.04%, and 0.993 for 10-fold cross-validation method."
2017,Deep Learning Accurately Predicts Estrogen Receptor Status in Breast Cancer Metabolomics Data,"Metabolomics holds the promise as a new technology to diagnose highly heterogeneous diseases. Conventionally, metabolomics data analysis for diagnosis is done using various statistical and machine learning based classification methods. However, it remains unknown if deep neural network, a class of increasingly popular machine learning methods, is suitable to classify metabolomics data. Here we use a cohort of 271 breast cancer tissues, 204 positive estrogen receptor (ER+) and 67 negative estrogen receptor (ER-), to test the accuracies of autoencoder, a deep learning (DL) framework, as well as six widely used machine learning models, namely Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Recursive Partitioning and Regression Trees (RPART), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Prediction Analysis for Microarrays (PAM), and Generalized Boosted Models (GBM). DL framework has the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93 in classifying ER+/ER-patients, compared to the other six machine learning algorithms. Furthermore, the biological interpretation of the first hidden layer reveals eight commonly enriched significant metabolomics pathways (adjusted P-value<0.05) that cannot be discovered by other machine learning methods. Among them, protein digestion & absorption and ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters pathways are also confirmed in integrated analysis between metabolomics and gene expression data in these samples. In summary, deep learning method shows advantages for metabolomics based breast cancer ER status classification, with both the highest prediction accurcy (AUC=0.93) and better revelation of disease biology. We encourage the adoption of autoencoder based deep learning method in the metabolomics research community for classification."
2019,Curcumin Nanoformulations for Colorectal Cancer: A Review,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most prevalent form of cancer, after lung cancer and breast cancer, with the second highest death incidence. Over the years, natural compounds have been explored as an alternative to conventional cancer therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Curcumin, an active constituent of turmeric has been associated with various health benefits. It has gained much attention as an anticancer agent due to its ability to regulate multiple cell signaling pathways, including NF-κB, STAT3, activated protein-1 (AP-1), epidermal growth response-1 (Egr-1), and p53, which are crucial in cancer development and progression. Nevertheless, the clinical application of curcumin is greatly restricted because of its low water solubility, poor oral absorption, and rapid metabolism. These issues have led to the development of curcumin nanoformulations to overcome the limitations of the compound. Nanotechnology-based delivery systems have been widely used in improving the delivery of poorly-water soluble drugs. Besides, these systems also come with the added benefits of possible cellular targeting and improvement in cellular uptake. An ideal improved formulation should display a greater anticancer activity compared to free curcumin, and at the same time be non-toxic to the normal cells. In this review, we focus on the design and development of various nanoformulations to deliver curcumin for use in CRC such as liposomes, micelles, polymer nanoparticles, nanogels, cyclodextrin complexes, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN), phytosomes, and gold nanoparticles. We also discuss the current pre-clinical and clinical evidences of curcumin nanoformulations in CRC therapy, analyse the research gap, and address the future direction of this research area."
2016,Long-Term Safety of Letrozole and Gonadotropin Stimulation for Fertility Preservation in Women With Breast Cancer.,"CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE There has been increased attention to the issue of fertility preservation (FP). We aimed to investigate the long-term safety of FP via controlled ovarian stimulation with letrozole supplementation (COSTLES) prior to breast cancer treatment. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This is a prospective, nonrandomized, controlled study conducted between the years 2002 and 2014. A total of 337 women diagnosed with stage 3 or less invasive breast cancer were enrolled during a FP consultation before chemotherapy. Of those, 120 elected to undergo COSTLES for FP prior to chemotherapy (FP group). The remaining 217 patients did not undergo any FP procedure and served as the controls. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE The primary end point was cancer recurrence defined as the detection of locoregional tumor (chest wall, regional nodal disease), distant metastases, or contralateral invasive breast cancer. RESULTS The baseline characteristics at enrollment were similar between the FP and control groups except for the less frequent lymph node involvement (P = .02) in the former. The mean follow-up after diagnosis was 5.0 years in the FP group and 6.9 years in the control group. In the FP group, the hazard ratio for recurrence after ovarian stimulation was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.28–2.13), and the survival was not compromised compared with controls (P = .61). Neither BRCA gene mutation status (P = .57) nor undergoing FP before or after breast surgery (P = .44) affected survival outcomes in the FP group. Likewise, none of the tumor characteristics including the estrogen receptor status affected the survival rates after the COSTLES. CONCLUSIONS COSTLES is unlikely to cause a substantially increased recurrence risk in breast cancer during the 5 years after diagnosis."
2020,"Breast Cancer Survivorship, Quality of Life, and Late Toxicities","Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer in women: in 2018, almost two million cases have been diagnosed all over the world and it represents the principal cause of death from a neoplastic disease in women. In the past years, breast cancer prognosis has significantly improved over time: currently 5-year survival rates are in the range of 90%, and 10-year survival is about 80%. This improvement has been mostly observed in western countries, due to high coverage and compliance with screening programs, leading to early diagnosis, i.e., when the disease is at a subclinical level, and to an improvement in tumor molecular characterization and innovative systemic treatments. Yet the identification of different biological breast cancer subtypes prompted the development of innovative targeted agents and improved treatment personalization. On the other hand, longer survival rates and increasing proportions of cured patients require dedicated strategies to manage long-term sequelae of breast cancer treatments, with particular attention to quality of life. This review analyzes the most important issues, potentially occurring with cancer treatments, concerning long-term sequelae and quality of life, to define a global approach to breast cancer survivorship."
2020,Deep Learning vs. Radiomics for Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis of Breast Cancer Using Ultrasound Images: Don't Forget the Peritumoral Region,"Objective: Axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis status is important in guiding treatment in breast cancer. The aims were to assess how deep convolutional neural network (CNN) performed compared with radiomics analysis in predicting ALN metastasis using breast ultrasound, and to investigate the value of both intratumoral and peritumoral regions in ALN metastasis prediction. Methods: We retrospectively enrolled 479 breast cancer patients with 2,395 breast ultrasound images. Based on the intratumoral, peritumoral, and combined intra- and peritumoral regions, three CNNs were built using DenseNet, and three radiomics models were built using random forest, respectively. By combining the molecular subtype, another three CNNs and three radiomics models were built. All models were built on training cohort (343 patients 1,715 images) and evaluated on testing cohort (136 patients 680 images) with ROC analysis. Another prospective cohort of 16 patients was enrolled to further test the models. Results: AUCs of image-only CNNs in both training/testing cohorts were 0.957/0.912 for combined region, 0.944/0.775 for peritumoral region, and 0.937/0.748 for intratumoral region, which were numerically higher than their corresponding radiomics models with AUCs of 0.940/0.886, 0.920/0.724, and 0.913/0.693. The overall performance of image-molecular CNNs in terms of AUCs on training/testing cohorts slightly increased to 0.962/0.933, 0.951/0.813, and 0.931/0.794, respectively. AUCs of both CNNs and radiomics models built on combined region were significantly better than those on either intratumoral or peritumoral region on the testing cohort (p < 0.05). In the prospective study, the CNN model built on combined region achieved the highest AUC of 0.95 among all image-only models. Conclusions: CNNs showed numerically better overall performance compared with radiomics models in predicting ALN metastasis in breast cancer. For both CNNs and radiomics models, combining intratumoral, and peritumoral regions achieved significantly better performance."
2020,Role of Artificial Intelligence Applications in Real-Life Clinical Practice: Systematic Review,"BACKGROUND Artificial intelligence (AI) applications are growing at an unprecedented pace in health care, including disease diagnosis, triage or screening, risk analysis, surgical operations, and so forth. Despite a great deal of research in the development and validation of health care AI, only few applications have been actually implemented at the frontlines of clinical practice. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study was to systematically review AI applications that have been implemented in real-life clinical practice. METHODS We conducted a literature search in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Central, and CINAHL to identify relevant articles published between January 2010 and May 2020. We also hand searched premier computer science journals and conferences as well as registered clinical trials. Studies were included if they reported AI applications that had been implemented in real-world clinical settings. RESULTS We identified 51 relevant studies that reported the implementation and evaluation of AI applications in clinical practice, of which 13 adopted a randomized controlled trial design and eight adopted an experimental design. The AI applications targeted various clinical tasks, such as screening or triage (n=16), disease diagnosis (n=16), risk analysis (n=14), and treatment (n=7). The most commonly addressed diseases and conditions were sepsis (n=6), breast cancer (n=5), diabetic retinopathy (n=4), and polyp and adenoma (n=4). Regarding the evaluation outcomes, we found that 26 studies examined the performance of AI applications in clinical settings, 33 studies examined the effect of AI applications on clinician outcomes, 14 studies examined the effect on patient outcomes, and one study examined the economic impact associated with AI implementation. CONCLUSIONS This review indicates that research on the clinical implementation of AI applications is still at an early stage despite the great potential. More research needs to assess the benefits and challenges associated with clinical AI applications through a more rigorous methodology."
2019,SALMON: Survival Analysis Learning With Multi-Omics Neural Networks on Breast Cancer,"Improved cancer prognosis is a central goal for precision health medicine. Though many models can predict differential survival from data, there is a strong need for sophisticated algorithms that can aggregate and filter relevant predictors from increasingly complex data inputs. In turn, these models should provide deeper insight into which types of data are most relevant to improve prognosis. Deep Learning-based neural networks offer a potential solution for both problems because they are highly flexible and account for data complexity in a non-linear fashion. In this study, we implement Deep Learning-based networks to determine how gene expression data predicts Cox regression survival in breast cancer. We accomplish this through an algorithm called SALMON (Survival Analysis Learning with Multi-Omics Neural Networks), which aggregates and simplifies gene expression data and cancer biomarkers to enable prognosis prediction. The results revealed improved performance when more omics data were used in model construction. Rather than use raw gene expression values as model inputs, we innovatively use eigengene modules from the result of gene co-expression network analysis. The corresponding high impact co-expression modules and other omics data are identified by feature selection technique, then examined by conducting enrichment analysis and exploiting biological functions, escalated the interpretation of input feature from gene level to co-expression modules level. Our study shows the feasibility of discovering breast cancer related co-expression modules, sketch a blueprint of future endeavors on Deep Learning-based survival analysis. SALMON source code is available at https://github.com/huangzhii/SALMON/."
2020,Breast Cancer Histopathology Image Classification Using an Ensemble of Deep Learning Models,"Breast cancer is one of the major public health issues and is considered a leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women worldwide. Its early diagnosis can effectively help in increasing the chances of survival rate. To this end, biopsy is usually followed as a gold standard approach in which tissues are collected for microscopic analysis. However, the histopathological analysis of breast cancer is non-trivial, labor-intensive, and may lead to a high degree of disagreement among pathologists. Therefore, an automatic diagnostic system could assist pathologists to improve the effectiveness of diagnostic processes. This paper presents an ensemble deep learning approach for the definite classification of non-carcinoma and carcinoma breast cancer histopathology images using our collected dataset. We trained four different models based on pre-trained VGG16 and VGG19 architectures. Initially, we followed 5-fold cross-validation operations on all the individual models, namely, fully-trained VGG16, fine-tuned VGG16, fully-trained VGG19, and fine-tuned VGG19 models. Then, we followed an ensemble strategy by taking the average of predicted probabilities and found that the ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and fine-tuned VGG19 performed competitive classification performance, especially on the carcinoma class. The ensemble of fine-tuned VGG16 and VGG19 models offered sensitivity of 97.73% for carcinoma class and overall accuracy of 95.29%. Also, it offered an F1 score of 95.29%. These experimental results demonstrated that our proposed deep learning approach is effective for the automatic classification of complex-natured histopathology images of breast cancer, more specifically for carcinoma images."
2017,A Novel Approach for Breast Cancer Detection Using Data Mining Techniques,"Breast cancer is one of the leading cancers for women when compared to all other cancers. It is the second most common cause of cancer death in women. Breast cancer risk in India revealed that 1 in 28 women develop breast cancer during her lifetime. This is higher in urban areas being 1 in 22 in a lifetime compared to rural areas where this risk is relatively much lower being 1 in 60 women developing breast cancer in their lifetime. In India the average age of the high risk group is 43-46 years unlike in the west where women aged 53-57 years are more prone to breast cancer. The aim of this paper is to investigate the performance of different classification techniques. The data breast cancer data with a total 683 rows and 10 columns will be used to test, by using classification accuracy. We analyse the breast Cancer data available from the Wisconsin dataset from UCI machine learning with the aim of developing accurate prediction models for breast cancer using data mining techniques. In this experiment, we compare three classification techniques in Weka software and comparison results show that Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) has higher prediction accuracy i.e. 96.2% than IBK and BF Tree methods."
2021,Use of artificial intelligence for image analysis in breast cancer screening programmes: systematic review of test accuracy,"Abstract Objective To examine the accuracy of artificial intelligence (AI) for the detection of breast cancer in mammography screening practice. Design Systematic review of test accuracy studies. Data sources Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews from 1 January 2010 to 17 May 2021. Eligibility criteria Studies reporting test accuracy of AI algorithms, alone or in combination with radiologists, to detect cancer in women’s digital mammograms in screening practice, or in test sets. Reference standard was biopsy with histology or follow-up (for screen negative women). Outcomes included test accuracy and cancer type detected. Study selection and synthesis Two reviewers independently assessed articles for inclusion and assessed the methodological quality of included studies using the QUality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2 (QUADAS-2) tool. A single reviewer extracted data, which were checked by a second reviewer. Narrative data synthesis was performed. Results Twelve studies totalling 131 822 screened women were included. No prospective studies measuring test accuracy of AI in screening practice were found. Studies were of poor methodological quality. Three retrospective studies compared AI systems with the clinical decisions of the original radiologist, including 79 910 women, of whom 1878 had screen detected cancer or interval cancer within 12 months of screening. Thirty four (94%) of 36 AI systems evaluated in these studies were less accurate than a single radiologist, and all were less accurate than consensus of two or more radiologists. Five smaller studies (1086 women, 520 cancers) at high risk of bias and low generalisability to the clinical context reported that all five evaluated AI systems (as standalone to replace radiologist or as a reader aid) were more accurate than a single radiologist reading a test set in the laboratory. In three studies, AI used for triage screened out 53%, 45%, and 50% of women at low risk but also 10%, 4%, and 0% of cancers detected by radiologists. Conclusions Current evidence for AI does not yet allow judgement of its accuracy in breast cancer screening programmes, and it is unclear where on the clinical pathway AI might be of most benefit. AI systems are not sufficiently specific to replace radiologist double reading in screening programmes. Promising results in smaller studies are not replicated in larger studies. Prospective studies are required to measure the effect of AI in clinical practice. Such studies will require clear stopping rules to ensure that AI does not reduce programme specificity. Study registration Protocol registered as PROSPERO CRD42020213590."
2019,Boosting H2O2‐Guided Chemodynamic Therapy of Cancer by Enhancing Reaction Kinetics through Versatile Biomimetic Fenton Nanocatalysts and the Second Near‐Infrared Light Irradiation,"Fenton reaction–based chemodynamic therapy (CDT) has attracted considerable attention for tumor treatment, because the Fenton reaction can degrade endogenous H2O2 within the tumor to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) to kill cancer cells. The kinetics of the Fenton reaction has significantly influenced its treatment efficacy. It is crucial to enhance the reaction kinetics at the maximum H2O2 concentration to quickly produce vast amounts of ROS to achieve treatment efficacy, which to date, has not been realized. Herein, reported is an efficacious CDT treatment of breast cancer using biomimetic CS‐GOD@CM nanocatalysts, which are rationally designed to significantly boost the Fenton reaction through improvement of H2O2 concentration within tumors, and application of the second near‐infrared (NIR‐II) light irradiation at the maximum concentration, which is monitored by photoacoustic imaging. The biomimetic nanocatalysts are composed of ultra‐small Cu2−xSe (CS) nanoparticles, glucose oxidase (GOD), and tumor cell membrane (CM). The nanocatalysts can be retained in tumor for more than two days to oxidize glucose and produce an approximately 2.6‐fold increase in H2O2 to enhance the Fenton reaction under the NIR‐II irradiation. This work demonstrates for the first time the CDT treatment of cancer enhanced by the NIR‐II light."
2019,Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Using Mammographic Data: Systematic Review,"Background Machine learning (ML) has become a vital part of medical imaging research. ML methods have evolved over the years from manual seeded inputs to automatic initializations. The advancements in the field of ML have led to more intelligent and self-reliant computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems, as the learning ability of ML methods has been constantly improving. More and more automated methods are emerging with deep feature learning and representations. Recent advancements of ML with deeper and extensive representation approaches, commonly known as deep learning (DL) approaches, have made a very significant impact on improving the diagnostics capabilities of the CAD systems. Objective This review aimed to survey both traditional ML and DL literature with particular application for breast cancer diagnosis. The review also provided a brief insight into some well-known DL networks. Methods In this paper, we present an overview of ML and DL techniques with particular application for breast cancer. Specifically, we search the PubMed, Google Scholar, MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, Springer, and Web of Science databases and retrieve the studies in DL for the past 5 years that have used multiview mammogram datasets. Results The analysis of traditional ML reveals the limited usage of the methods, whereas the DL methods have great potential for implementation in clinical analysis and improve the diagnostic capability of existing CAD systems. Conclusions From the literature, it can be found that heterogeneous breast densities make masses more challenging to detect and classify compared with calcifications. The traditional ML methods present confined approaches limited to either particular density type or datasets. Although the DL methods show promising improvements in breast cancer diagnosis, there are still issues of data scarcity and computational cost, which have been overcome to a significant extent by applying data augmentation and improved computational power of DL algorithms."
2019,λ-DNA- and Aptamer-Mediated Sorting and Analysis of Extracellular Vesicles.,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are heavily implicated in diverse pathological processes. Due to their small size, distinct biogenesis, and heterogeneous marker expression, isolation and detection of single EV subpopulations are difficult. Here, we develop a λ-DNA- and aptamer-mediated approach allowing for simultaneous size-selective separation and surface protein analysis of individual EVs. Using a machine learning algorithm to EV signature based on their size and marker expression, we demonstrate that the isolated microvesicles are more efficient than exosomes and apoptotic bodies in discriminating breast cell lines and Stage II breast cancer patients with varied immunohistochemical expression of HER2. Our method provides an important tool to assess the EV heterogeneity at the single EV level with potential value in clinical diagnostics."
2021,Novel Transfer Learning Approach for Medical Imaging with Limited Labeled Data,"Deep learning requires a large amount of data to perform well. However, the field of medical image analysis suffers from a lack of sufficient data for training deep learning models. Moreover, medical images require manual labeling, usually provided by human annotators coming from various backgrounds. More importantly, the annotation process is time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors. Transfer learning was introduced to reduce the need for the annotation process by transferring the deep learning models with knowledge from a previous task and then by fine-tuning them on a relatively small dataset of the current task. Most of the methods of medical image classification employ transfer learning from pretrained models, e.g., ImageNet, which has been proven to be ineffective. This is due to the mismatch in learned features between the natural image, e.g., ImageNet, and medical images. Additionally, it results in the utilization of deeply elaborated models. In this paper, we propose a novel transfer learning approach to overcome the previous drawbacks by means of training the deep learning model on large unlabeled medical image datasets and by next transferring the knowledge to train the deep learning model on the small amount of labeled medical images. Additionally, we propose a new deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) model that combines recent advancements in the field. We conducted several experiments on two challenging medical imaging scenarios dealing with skin and breast cancer classification tasks. According to the reported results, it has been empirically proven that the proposed approach can significantly improve the performance of both classification scenarios. In terms of skin cancer, the proposed model achieved an F1-score value of 89.09% when trained from scratch and 98.53% with the proposed approach. Secondly, it achieved an accuracy value of 85.29% and 97.51%, respectively, when trained from scratch and using the proposed approach in the case of the breast cancer scenario. Finally, we concluded that our method can possibly be applied to many medical imaging problems in which a substantial amount of unlabeled image data is available and the labeled image data is limited. Moreover, it can be utilized to improve the performance of medical imaging tasks in the same domain. To do so, we used the pretrained skin cancer model to train on feet skin to classify them into two classes—either normal or abnormal (diabetic foot ulcer (DFU)). It achieved an F1-score value of 86.0% when trained from scratch, 96.25% using transfer learning, and 99.25% using double-transfer learning."
2020,Model-assisted cohort selection with bias analysis for generating large-scale cohorts from the EHR for oncology research,"Objective Electronic health records (EHRs) are a promising source of data for health outcomes research in oncology. A challenge in using EHR data is that selecting cohorts of patients often requires information in unstructured parts of the record. Machine learning has been used to address this, but even high-performing algorithms may select patients in a non-random manner and bias the resulting cohort. To improve the efficiency of cohort selection while measuring potential bias, we introduce a technique called Model-Assisted Cohort Selection (MACS) with Bias Analysis and apply it to the selection of metastatic breast cancer (mBC) patients. Materials and Methods We trained a model on 17,263 patients using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency (TF-IDF) and logistic regression. We used a test set of 17,292 patients to measure algorithm performance and perform Bias Analysis. We compared the cohort generated by MACS to the cohort that would have been generated without MACS as reference standard, first by comparing distributions of an extensive set of clinical and demographic variables and then by comparing the results of two analyses addressing existing example research questions. Results Our algorithm had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.976, a sensitivity of 96.0%, and an abstraction efficiency gain of 77.9%. During Bias Analysis, we found no large differences in baseline characteristics and no differences in the example analyses. Conclusion MACS with bias analysis can significantly improve the efficiency of cohort selection on EHR data while instilling confidence that outcomes research performed on the resulting cohort will not be biased."
2017,Clinical application of a microfluidic chip for immunocapture and quantification of circulating exosomes to assist breast cancer diagnosis and molecular classification,"Increasing attention has been attracted by exosomes in blood-based diagnosis because cancer cells release more exosomes in serum than normal cells and these exosomes overexpress a certain number of cancer-related biomarkers. However, capture and biomarker analysis of exosomes for clinical application are technically challenging. In this study, we developed a microfluidic chip for immunocapture and quantification of circulating exosomes from small sample volume and applied this device in clinical study. Circulating EpCAM-positive exosomes were measured in 6 cases breast cancer patients and 3 healthy controls to assist diagnosis. A significant increase in the EpCAM-positive exosome level in these patients was detected, compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, we quantified circulating HER2-positive exosomes in 19 cases of breast cancer patients for molecular classification. We demonstrated that the exosomal HER2 expression levels were almost consistent with that in tumor tissues assessed by immunohistochemical staining. The microfluidic chip might provide a new platform to assist breast cancer diagnosis and molecular classification."
2022,Breast Cancer Detection on Histopathological Images Using a Composite Dilated Backbone Network,"Breast cancer is a lethal illness that has a high mortality rate. In treatment, the accuracy of diagnosis is crucial. Machine learning and deep learning may be beneficial to doctors. The proposed backbone network is critical for the present performance of CNN-based detectors. Integrating dilated convolution, ResNet, and Alexnet increases detection performance. The composite dilated backbone network (CDBN) is an innovative method for integrating many identical backbones into a single robust backbone. Hence, CDBN uses the lead backbone feature maps to identify objects. It feeds high-level output features from previous backbones into the next backbone in a stepwise way. We show that most contemporary detectors can easily include CDBN to improve performance achieved mAP improvements ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 percent on the breast cancer histopathological image classification (BreakHis) dataset. Experiments have also shown that instance segmentation may be improved. In the BreakHis dataset, CDBN enhances the baseline detector cascade mask R-CNN (mAP = 53.3). The proposed CDBN detector does not need pretraining. It creates high-level traits by combining low-level elements. This network is made up of several identical backbones that are linked together. The composite dilated backbone considers the linked backbones CDBN."
2018,Oxygen-generating Hybrid Polymeric Nanoparticles with Encapsulated Doxorubicin and Chlorin e6 for Trimodal Imaging-Guided Combined Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy,"The combination of chemotherapy with photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted broad attention as it can overcome limitations of conventional chemo-treatment by using different modes of action. However, the efficacy of PDT to treat solid tumors is severely affected by hypoxia in tumors. Methods: In this study, we developed oxygen-generating theranostic nanoparticles (CDM NPs) by hierarchically assembling doxorubicin (DOX), chlorin e6 (Ce6) and colloidal manganese dioxide (MnO2) with poly (ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)-b-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-poly (ε-caprolactone-co-lactide) for treating breast cancer. The in vitro and in vivo antitumor efficacy and imaging performance were investigated. Results: The theranostic nanoparticles showed high stability and biocompatibility both in vitro and in vivo. MnO2 within the nanoparticles could trigger decomposition of excessive endogenous H2O2 in the tumor microenvironment to generate oxygen in-situ to relieve tumor hypoxia. With enhanced oxygen generation, the PDT effect was significantly improved under laser-irradiation. More importantly, this effect together with that of DOX was able to dramatically promote the combined chemotherapy-PDT efficacy of CDM NPs in an MCF-7 tumor-bearing mouse model. Furthermore, the real-time tumor accumulation of the nanocomposites could be monitored by fluorescence imaging, photoacoustic (PA) imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Conclusion: The designed CDM NPs are expected to provide an alternative way of improving antitumor efficacy by combined chemo-PDT further enhanced by oxygen generation, and would have broad applications in cancer theranostics."
2016,Machine learning models in breast cancer survival prediction.,"BACKGROUND Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers with a high mortality rate among women. With the early diagnosis of breast cancer survival will increase from 56% to more than 86%. Therefore, an accurate and reliable system is necessary for the early diagnosis of this cancer. The proposed model is the combination of rules and different machine learning techniques. Machine learning models can help physicians to reduce the number of false decisions. They try to exploit patterns and relationships among a large number of cases and predict the outcome of a disease using historical cases stored in datasets. OBJECTIVE The objective of this study is to propose a rule-based classification method with machine learning techniques for the prediction of different types of Breast cancer survival. METHODS We use a dataset with eight attributes that include the records of 900 patients in which 876 patients (97.3%) and 24 (2.7%) patients were females and males respectively. Naive Bayes (NB), Trees Random Forest (TRF), 1-Nearest Neighbor (1NN), AdaBoost (AD), Support Vector Machine (SVM), RBF Network (RBFN), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) machine learning techniques with 10-cross fold technique were used with the proposed model for the prediction of breast cancer survival. The performance of machine learning techniques were evaluated with accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and area under ROC curve. RESULTS Out of 900 patients, 803 patients and 97 patients were alive and dead, respectively. In this study, Trees Random Forest (TRF) technique showed better results in comparison to other techniques (NB, 1NN, AD, SVM and RBFN, MLP). The accuracy, sensitivity and the area under ROC curve of TRF are 96%, 96%, 93%, respectively. However, 1NN machine learning technique provided poor performance (accuracy 91%, sensitivity 91% and area under ROC curve 78%). CONCLUSIONS This study demonstrates that Trees Random Forest model (TRF) which is a rule-based classification model was the best model with the highest level of accuracy. Therefore, this model is recommended as a useful tool for breast cancer survival prediction as well as medical decision making."
2022,Applications of Explainable Artificial Intelligence in Diagnosis and Surgery,"In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has shown great promise in medicine. However, explainability issues make AI applications in clinical usages difficult. Some research has been conducted into explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to overcome the limitation of the black-box nature of AI methods. Compared with AI techniques such as deep learning, XAI can provide both decision-making and explanations of the model. In this review, we conducted a survey of the recent trends in medical diagnosis and surgical applications using XAI. We have searched articles published between 2019 and 2021 from PubMed, IEEE Xplore, Association for Computing Machinery, and Google Scholar. We included articles which met the selection criteria in the review and then extracted and analyzed relevant information from the studies. Additionally, we provide an experimental showcase on breast cancer diagnosis, and illustrate how XAI can be applied in medical XAI applications. Finally, we summarize the XAI methods utilized in the medical XAI applications, the challenges that the researchers have met, and discuss the future research directions. The survey result indicates that medical XAI is a promising research direction, and this study aims to serve as a reference to medical experts and AI scientists when designing medical XAI applications."
2015,"Exosomes in development, metastasis and drug resistance of breast cancer","Transport through the cell membrane can be divided into active, passive and vesicular types (exosomes). Exosomes are nano‐sized vesicles released by a variety of cells. Emerging evidence shows that exosomes play a critical role in cancers. Exosomes mediate communication between stroma and cancer cells through the transfer of nucleic acid and proteins. It is demonstrated that the contents and the quantity of exosomes will change after occurrence of cancers. Over the last decade, growing attention has been paid to the role of exosomes in the development of breast cancer, the most life‐threatening cancer in women. Breast cancer could induce salivary glands to secret specific exosomes, which could be used as biomarkers in the diagnosis of early breast cancer. Exosome‐delivered nucleic acid and proteins partly facilitate the tumorigenesis, metastasis and resistance of breast cancer. Exosomes could also transmit anti‐cancer drugs outside breast cancer cells, therefore leading to drug resistance. However, exosomes are effective tools for transportation of anti‐cancer drugs with lower immunogenicity and toxicity. This is a promising way to establish a drug delivery system."
2022,"Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: A Brief Review About Epidemiology, Risk Factors, Signaling Pathways, Treatment and Role of Artificial Intelligence","Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a kind of breast cancer that lacks estrogen, progesterone, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2. This cancer is responsible for more than 15–20% of all breast cancers and is of particular research interest as it is therapeutically challenging mainly because of its low response to therapeutics and highly invasive nature. The non-availability of specific treatment options for TNBC is usually managed by conventional therapy, which often leads to relapse. The focus of this review is to provide up-to-date information related to TNBC epidemiology, risk factors, metastasis, different signaling pathways, and the pathways that can be blocked, immune suppressive cells of the TNBC microenvironment, current and investigation therapies, prognosis, and the role of artificial intelligence in TNBC diagnosis. The data presented in this paper may be helpful for researchers working in the field to obtain general and particular information to advance the understanding of TNBC and provide suitable disease management in the future."
2019,Radiomics of Brain MRI: Utility in Prediction of Metastatic Tumor Type.,"Purpose To investigate the feasibility of tumor type prediction with MRI radiomic image features of different brain metastases in a multiclass machine learning approach for patients with unknown primary lesion at the time of diagnosis. Materials and methods This single-center retrospective analysis included radiomic features of 658 brain metastases from T1-weighted contrast material-enhanced, T1-weighted nonenhanced, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) images in 189 patients (101 women, 88 men; mean age, 61 years; age range, 32-85 years). Images were acquired over a 9-year period (from September 2007 through December 2016) with different MRI units, reflecting heterogeneous image data. Included metastases originated from breast cancer (n = 143), small cell lung cancer (n = 151), non-small cell lung cancer (n = 225), gastrointestinal cancer (n = 50), and melanoma (n = 89). A total of 1423 quantitative image features and basic clinical data were evaluated by using random forest machine learning algorithms. Validation was performed with model-external fivefold cross validation. Comparative analysis of 10 randomly drawn cross-validation sets verified the stability of the results. The classifier performance was compared with predictions from a respective conventional reading by two radiologists. Results Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the five-class problem ranged between 0.64 (for non-small cell lung cancer) and 0.82 (for melanoma); all P values were less than .01. Prediction performance of the classifier was superior to the radiologists' readings. Highest differences were observed for melanoma, with a 17-percentage-point gain in sensitivity compared with the sensitivity of both readers; P values were less than .02. Conclusion Quantitative features of routine brain MR images used in a machine learning classifier provided high discriminatory accuracy in predicting the tumor type of brain metastases. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2022,Breast Cancer Classification from Ultrasound Images Using Probability-Based Optimal Deep Learning Feature Fusion,"After lung cancer, breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women. If breast cancer is detected early, mortality rates in women can be reduced. Because manual breast cancer diagnosis takes a long time, an automated system is required for early cancer detection. This paper proposes a new framework for breast cancer classification from ultrasound images that employs deep learning and the fusion of the best selected features. The proposed framework is divided into five major steps: (i) data augmentation is performed to increase the size of the original dataset for better learning of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models; (ii) a pre-trained DarkNet-53 model is considered and the output layer is modified based on the augmented dataset classes; (iii) the modified model is trained using transfer learning and features are extracted from the global average pooling layer; (iv) the best features are selected using two improved optimization algorithms known as reformed differential evaluation (RDE) and reformed gray wolf (RGW); and (v) the best selected features are fused using a new probability-based serial approach and classified using machine learning algorithms. The experiment was conducted on an augmented Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset, and the best accuracy was 99.1%. When compared with recent techniques, the proposed framework outperforms them."
2021,Deep-Learning-Empowered Breast Cancer Auxiliary Diagnosis for 5GB Remote E-Health,"Breast cancer, the most common cancer in women, is receiving increasing attention. The lack of high-quality medical resources, especially highly skilled doctors, in remote areas makes the diagnosis of breast cancer inefficient and causes great harm to women. The emergence of remote e-health has improved the situation to a certain extent, but its capabilities are still hampered by technical limitations, which manifest in two main aspects. First, due to network bandwidth limitations, it is difficult to guarantee the real-time transmission of breast cancer pathology images between remote areas and cities. Second, the highly skilled breast cancer doctors at large city hospitals are not guaranteed to be available for online diagnosis at all times. To overcome these limitations, this article proposes a deep-learning-empowered breast cancer auxiliary diagnosis scheme for remote e-health supported by 5G technology and beyond (5GB remote e-health). In this scheme, breast pathology images are first received from major hospitals via 5G, and a deep learning model based on the Inception-v3 network is subjected to transfer learning to obtain a diagnostic model. This diagnostic model is then employed on edge servers for auxiliary diagnosis at remote area hospitals. A theoretical analysis and experimental results show that this solution not only overcomes the two problems mentioned above but also improves the diagnostic accuracy for breast cancer in remote areas to 98.19 percent."
2017,Deep Learning Algorithms for Detection of Lymph Node Metastases From Breast Cancer: Helping Artificial Intelligence Be Seen.,"Artificial intelligence (AI), the theory and development of computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence, is creeping into almost every facet of modern life. Familiar examples include computer chess games, speech recognition, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and autonomous driving cars. In the financial sector, AI is routinely used for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and chatbots (ie, computer programs that appear to conduct conversations via auditory or textual methods, such as with online virtual assistants). Health care has been slower to adopt AI but the pace of implementation is accelerating at an impressive rate. In 2014, the acquisition of AI startups in health care was about $600 million; in 2021, it is anticipated to be $6.6 billion or a 40% compound annual growth rate.1 One reason health care is ripe for AI is “big data”: the health care industry has rich data sets that are ideal for AI given the requirement for large test sets of data with which the computer can “learn.” Most computer modeling enhancements in health care, particularly in the image analysis field, have focused on feature engineering, essentially asking a computer to evaluate explicit features specified by experts. This permits the algorithms to detect abnormalities or predict specified lesions. In contrast, deep learning is a form of AI that includes machine learning techniques that perform iterative optimization strategies that are based on pixel-by-pixel evaluation of the data from images.2 The promise of AI in health care is the delivery of improved quality and safety of care and the potential to democratize expertise. For example, in a study by Esteva et al,3 the authors compared the ability of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to discriminate the most common skin cancers including malignant melanoma. They compared and demonstrated at least equivalence in the performance of their algorithm against 21 board-certified dermatologists in evaluating biopsy-proven clinical images. In this example, AI was used to discriminate whether skin lesions were malignant. The authors suggested that mobile devices, like smartphones, could be deployed with similar algorithms, permitting potentially low-cost universal access to vital diagnostic care anywhere in the world. In another study, Gulshan et al4 applied a deep CNN approach to a test set of more than 128 000 retinal fundus images from adult patients with diabetes to identify referable diabetic retinopathy. The algorithm developed had very high sensitivity and specificity for detecting referable diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.4 This study established a clear path toward use of AI not to replace physicians, but rather to perform simple, cost-effective, and widely available examinations and analyses that could help identify at-risk patients who require referral for specialty care while reassuring other patients that potential retinal manifestations of their diabetes are not present or are stable. Radiology, having converted to digital images more than 25 years ago, is well-positioned to deploy AI for diagnostics. Several studies have shown considerable opportunity to support radiologists in evaluating a variety of scan types including mammography for breast lesions, computed tomographic scans for pulmonary nodules and infections, and magnetic resonance images for brain tumors including the molecular classification of brain tumors.5-9 In contrast to radiology, pathology has been late to adopt digital imaging and thus computer-assisted diagnostic technologies. In part, this is the result of practical and financial obstacles. With conversion to digital images, radiology eliminated film, chemicals, developers, and storage of the films. Radiology departments also solved problems related to loss of films and transport of films to where they are needed, for example, in operating rooms, emergency departments, and intensive care units. Unforeseen at the time, although anticipated by some, was the inherent value within these images for greater learning using computers to improve the quality, safety, and efficiency of radiologists. Many, if not most, of the practical benefits realized by radiology would not be achieved with pathology digitization. An anatomic pathology workflow that includes digital pathology will not reduce or remove the need to produce and ultimately store glass slides of pathology specimens. Instead of any reductions, digital pathology will require additional workflows, personnel, equipment, and importantly storage of data (it is estimated that digital pathology images are at least 10 times larger files than radiology images), all on top of an already financially and operationally stressed health care system. Certainly, the adoption of digital pathology will bring some advantages, particularly in areas such as rapid teleconsultations with experts and in quality and safety.

2017,Hybrid Approach of Relation Network and Localized Graph Convolutional Filtering for Breast Cancer Subtype Classification,"Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown an ability to address the problem like this. However, it conventionally used grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. To overcome the issue, we propose a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). Experimental results on synthetic data and breast cancer data demonstrate that our proposed method shows better performances than existing methods."
2020,External Evaluation of 3 Commercial Artificial Intelligence Algorithms for Independent Assessment of Screening Mammograms.,"Importance A computer algorithm that performs at or above the level of radiologists in mammography screening assessment could improve the effectiveness of breast cancer screening. Objective To perform an external evaluation of 3 commercially available artificial intelligence (AI) computer-aided detection algorithms as independent mammography readers and to assess the screening performance when combined with radiologists. Design, Setting, and Participants This retrospective case-control study was based on a double-reader population-based mammography screening cohort of women screened at an academic hospital in Stockholm, Sweden, from 2008 to 2015. The study included 8805 women aged 40 to 74 years who underwent mammography screening and who did not have implants or prior breast cancer. The study sample included 739 women who were diagnosed as having breast cancer (positive) and a random sample of 8066 healthy controls (negative for breast cancer). Main Outcomes and Measures Positive follow-up findings were determined by pathology-verified diagnosis at screening or within 12 months thereafter. Negative follow-up findings were determined by a 2-year cancer-free follow-up. Three AI computer-aided detection algorithms (AI-1, AI-2, and AI-3), sourced from different vendors, yielded a continuous score for the suspicion of cancer in each mammography examination. For a decision of normal or abnormal, the cut point was defined by the mean specificity of the first-reader radiologists (96.6%). Results The median age of study participants was 60 years (interquartile range, 50-66 years) for 739 women who received a diagnosis of breast cancer and 54 years (interquartile range, 47-63 years) for 8066 healthy controls. The cases positive for cancer comprised 618 (84%) screen detected and 121 (16%) clinically detected within 12 months of the screening examination. The area under the receiver operating curve for cancer detection was 0.956 (95% CI, 0.948-0.965) for AI-1, 0.922 (95% CI, 0.910-0.934) for AI-2, and 0.920 (95% CI, 0.909-0.931) for AI-3. At the specificity of the radiologists, the sensitivities were 81.9% for AI-1, 67.0% for AI-2, 67.4% for AI-3, 77.4% for first-reader radiologist, and 80.1% for second-reader radiologist. Combining AI-1 with first-reader radiologists achieved 88.6% sensitivity at 93.0% specificity (abnormal defined by either of the 2 making an abnormal assessment). No other examined combination of AI algorithms and radiologists surpassed this sensitivity level. Conclusions and Relevance To our knowledge, this study is the first independent evaluation of several AI computer-aided detection algorithms for screening mammography. The results of this study indicated that a commercially available AI computer-aided detection algorithm can assess screening mammograms with a sufficient diagnostic performance to be further evaluated as an independent reader in prospective clinical trials. Combining the first readers with the best algorithm identified more cases positive for cancer than combining the first readers with second readers."
2014,Essential role for TrpC5-containing extracellular vesicles in breast cancer with chemotherapeutic resistance,"Significance A critical challenge for chemotherapy is development of chemoresistance, but underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we found that drug-resistant adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells possessed numerous transient receptor potential channel 5 (TrpC5) -containing extracellular vesicles (EVs) on the cell surface. Suppressing TrpC5 expression diminished the formation of EVs. Incubation of drug-sensitive recipient cells with EVs endowed recipients with drug-resistant properties. In both human samples and a mouse model of breast cancer, the expression of TrpC5 proteins was high in the tumor, and the levels of TrpC5-positive EVs were high in the circulation. These data suggest a critical role of TrpC5-containing EVs in the transfer of drug resistance. In the future, monitoring TrpC5-containing EVs in the circulation could potentially be used to predict the clinical outcome of chemotherapy. A critical challenge for chemotherapy is the development of chemoresistance in breast cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms and validated predictors remain unclear. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have gained attention as potential means for cancer cells to share intracellular contents. In adriamycin-resistant human breast cancer cells (MCF-7/ADM), we analyzed the role of transient receptor potential channel 5 (TrpC5) in EV formation and transfer as well as the diagnostic implications. Up-regulated TrpC5, accumulated in EVs, is responsible for EV formation and trapping of adriamycin (ADM) in EVs. EV-mediated intercellular transfer of TrpC5 allowed recipient cells to acquire TrpC5, consequently stimulating multidrug efflux transporter P-glycoprotein production through a Ca2+- and activated T-cells isoform c3-mediated mechanism and thus, conferring chemoresistance on nonresistant cells. TrpC5-containing circulating EVs were detected in nude mice bearing MCF-7/ADM tumor xenografts, and the level was lower after TrpC5–siRNA treatment. In breast cancer patients who underwent chemotherapy, TrpC5 expression in the tumor was significantly higher in patients with progressive or stable disease than in patients with a partial or complete response. TrpC5-containing circulating EVs were found in peripheral blood from patients who underwent chemotherapy but not patients without chemotherapy. Taken together, we found that TrpC5-containing circulating EVs may transfer chemoresistance property to nonchemoresistant recipient cells. It may be worthwhile to further explore the potential of using TrpC5-containing EVs as a diagnostic biomarker for chemoresistant breast cancer."
2021,To engage or not to engage with AI for critical judgments: How professionals deal with opacity when using AI for medical diagnosis,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies promise to transform how professionals conduct knowledge work by augmenting their capabilities for making professional judgments. We know little, however, about how human-AI augmentation takes place in practice. Yet, gaining this understanding is particularly important when professionals use AI tools to form judgments on critical decisions. We conducted an in-depth field study in a major U.S. hospital where AI tools were used in three departments by diagnostic radiologists making breast cancer, lung cancer, and bone age determinations. The study illustrates the hindering effects of opacity that professionals experienced when using AI tools and explores how these professionals grappled with it in practice. In all three departments, this opacity resulted in professionals experiencing increased uncertainty because AI tool results often diverged from their initial judgment without providing underlying reasoning. Only in one department (of the three) did professionals consistently incorporate AI results into their final judgments, achieving what we call engaged augmentation. These professionals invested in AI interrogation practices—practices enacted by human experts to relate their own knowledge claims to AI knowledge claims. Professionals in the other two departments did not enact such practices and did not incorporate AI inputs into their final decisions, which we call unengaged “augmentation.” Our study unpacks the challenges involved in augmenting professional judgment with powerful, yet opaque, technologies and contributes to literature on AI adoption in knowledge work."
2018,Cancer imaging phenomics toolkit: quantitative imaging analytics for precision diagnostics and predictive modeling of clinical outcome,"Abstract. The growth of multiparametric imaging protocols has paved the way for quantitative imaging phenotypes that predict treatment response and clinical outcome, reflect underlying cancer molecular characteristics and spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and can guide personalized treatment planning. This growth has underlined the need for efficient quantitative analytics to derive high-dimensional imaging signatures of diagnostic and predictive value in this emerging era of integrated precision diagnostics. This paper presents cancer imaging phenomics toolkit (CaPTk), a new and dynamically growing software platform for analysis of radiographic images of cancer, currently focusing on brain, breast, and lung cancer. CaPTk leverages the value of quantitative imaging analytics along with machine learning to derive phenotypic imaging signatures, based on two-level functionality. First, image analysis algorithms are used to extract comprehensive panels of diverse and complementary features, such as multiparametric intensity histogram distributions, texture, shape, kinetics, connectomics, and spatial patterns. At the second level, these quantitative imaging signatures are fed into multivariate machine learning models to produce diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive biomarkers. Results from clinical studies in three areas are shown: (i) computational neuro-oncology of brain gliomas for precision diagnostics, prediction of outcome, and treatment planning; (ii) prediction of treatment response for breast and lung cancer, and (iii) risk assessment for breast cancer."
2017,Identification of circular RNAs as a promising new class of diagnostic biomarkers for human breast cancer,"Endogenous noncoding circular RNAs (circRNAs) have gained attention for their involvement in carcinogenesis, but their expression pattern in breast cancer has remained largely unknown. In this two-stage study, we first used an Arraystar Human circRNA Array to construct a genome-wide circRNA profile. We then selected candidate circRNAs for validation using a quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction system. CircRNA/miRNA interactions were predicted and sequence analyses were performed. Among 1155 differentially expressed circRNAs, 715 were upregulated and 440 were downregulated in breast cancer tissues. The validation study demonstrated that hsa_circ_103110, hsa_circ_104689 and hsa_circ_104821 levels were elevated in breast cancer tissues, whereas hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were downregulated. These circRNAs targeted complementary miRNA response elements. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for distinguishing breast cancer was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.73-0.90) when hsa_circ_006054, hsa_circ_100219 and hsa_circ_406697 were used in combination. This study provides evidence that circRNAs are differentially expressed in breast cancer and are important in carcinogenesis because they participate in cancer-related pathways and sequester miRNAs."
2017,Experimental Demonstration of Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction Using Memristor Networks.,"Memristors have been considered as a leading candidate for a number of critical applications ranging from nonvolatile memory to non-Von Neumann computing systems. Feature extraction, which aims to transform input data from a high-dimensional space to a space with fewer dimensions, is an important technique widely used in machine learning and pattern recognition applications. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that memristor arrays can be used to perform principal component analysis, one of the most commonly used feature extraction techniques, through online, unsupervised learning. Using Sanger's rule, that is, the generalized Hebbian algorithm, the principal components were obtained as the memristor conductances in the network after training. The network was then used to analyze sensory data from a standard breast cancer screening database with high classification success rate (97.1%)."
2014,Long non-coding RNA HOTAIR in carcinogenesis and metastasis.,"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have gained massive attention in recent years as a potentially new and crucial layer of gene regulation. LncRNAs are prevalently transcribed in the genome, but their roles in gene regulation and disease development are largely unknown. HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), a lncRNA located in the HOXC locus, has been shown to repress HOXD gene expression and promote breast cancer metastasis. Mechanistically, HOTAIR interacts with and recruits polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) and regulates chromosome occupancy by EZH2 (a subunit of PRC2), which leads to histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation of the HOXD locus. Moreover, HOTAIR is pervasively overexpressed in most human cancers compared with noncancerous adjacent tissues. This review summarizes the studies on the HOTAIR lncRNA over the past 6 years."
2016,"Initial Surgery and Survival in Stage IV Breast Cancer in the United States, 1988-2011.","IMPORTANCE Management of the primary tumor site in patients with metastatic breast cancer remains controversial. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the patterns of receipt of initial breast surgery for female patients with stage IV breast cancer in the United States, with particular attention to women who survived at least 10 years. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A retrospective cohort study using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program. Female patients diagnosed as having stage IV breast cancer between 1988 and 2011 and who did not receive radiation therapy as part of the first course of treatment were included (N = 21 372). Kaplan-Meier estimates of median survival and descriptive statistics were used to compare patient and tumor characteristics by receipt of breast surgery at diagnosis. A Royston-Parmar survival model and logistic regression analysis assessed demographic and clinical factors associated with survival and prolonged survival (of at least 10 years). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Differences in survival, particularly survival of at least 10 years, by receipt of initial surgery to the primary tumor. RESULTS Among the 21 372 patients, the median survival increased from 20 months (1988-1991) to 26 months (2007-2011). During this time, the rate of surgery declined (odds ratio [OR], 0.16; 95% CI, 0.12-0.21). Even so, receipt of surgery was associated with improved survival in multivariate analysis, which controlled for patient and clinical characteristics, along with time period (hazard ratio, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63). For women diagnosed as having cancer before 2002 (n = 7504), survival of at least 10 years was seen in 9.6% (n = 353) and 2.9% (n = 107) of those who did and did not receive surgery, respectively (OR, 3.61; 95% CI, 2.89-4.50). In multivariate analysis, survival of at least 10 years was associated with receipt of surgery (odds ratio, 2.80; 95% CI, 2.08-3.77), hormone receptor-positive disease (OR, 1.76; 95% CI, 1.25-2.48), older age (OR, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32-0.54), larger tumor size (OR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.27-0.51), marital status of being separated at the time of diagnosis (OR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.51-0.88), and more recent year of diagnosis (OR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.02-1.99). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Survival in stage IV breast cancer has improved and is increasingly of prolonged duration, particularly for some women undergoing initial breast surgery. As systemic therapy advances provide better control of distant disease in stage IV breast cancer, and as women present with lower distant disease burdens, these findings on initial surgery to the primary tumor may be of importance."
2017,Automated Analysis of Unregistered Multi-View Mammograms With Deep Learning,"We describe an automated methodology for the analysis of unregistered cranio-caudal (CC) and medio-lateral oblique (MLO) mammography views in order to estimate the patient’s risk of developing breast cancer. The main innovation behind this methodology lies in the use of deep learning models for the problem of jointly classifying unregistered mammogram views and respective segmentation maps of breast lesions (i.e., masses and micro-calcifications). This is a holistic methodology that can classify a whole mammographic exam, containing the CC and MLO views and the segmentation maps, as opposed to the classification of individual lesions, which is the dominant approach in the field. We also demonstrate that the proposed system is capable of using the segmentation maps generated by automated mass and micro-calcification detection systems, and still producing accurate results. The semi-automated approach (using manually defined mass and micro-calcification segmentation maps) is tested on two publicly available data sets (INbreast and DDSM), and results show that the volume under ROC surface (VUS) for a 3-class problem (normal tissue, benign, and malignant) is over 0.9, the area under ROC curve (AUC) for the 2-class “benign versus malignant” problem is over 0.9, and for the 2-class breast screening problem (malignancy versus normal/benign) is also over 0.9. For the fully automated approach, the VUS results on INbreast is over 0.7, and the AUC for the 2-class “benign versus malignant” problem is over 0.78, and the AUC for the 2-class breast screening is 0.86."
2018,Her2Net: A Deep Framework for Semantic Segmentation and Classification of Cell Membranes and Nuclei in Breast Cancer Evaluation,"We present an efficient deep learning framework for identifying, segmenting, and classifying cell membranes and nuclei from human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2)-stained breast cancer images with minimal user intervention. This is a long-standing issue for pathologists because the manual quantification of HER2 is error-prone, costly, and time-consuming. Hence, we propose a deep learning-based HER2 deep neural network (Her2Net) to solve this issue. The convolutional and deconvolutional parts of the proposed Her2Net framework consisted mainly of multiple convolution layers, max-pooling layers, spatial pyramid pooling layers, deconvolution layers, up-sampling layers, and trapezoidal long short-term memory (TLSTM). A fully connected layer and a softmax layer were also used for classification and error estimation. Finally, HER2 scores were calculated based on the classification results. The main contribution of our proposed Her2Net framework includes the implementation of TLSTM and a deep learning framework for cell membrane and nucleus detection, segmentation, and classification and HER2 scoring. Our proposed Her2Net achieved 96.64% precision, 96.79% recall, 96.71% F-score, 93.08% negative predictive value, 98.33% accuracy, and a 6.84% false-positive rate. Our results demonstrate the high accuracy and wide applicability of the proposed Her2Net in the context of HER2 scoring for breast cancer evaluation."
2019,Precision medicine for human cancers with Notch signaling dysregulation (Review),"NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3 and NOTCH4 are transmembrane receptors that transduce juxtacrine signals of the delta-like canonical Notch ligand (DLL)1, DLL3, DLL4, jagged canonical Notch ligand (JAG)1 and JAG2. Canonical Notch signaling activates the transcription of BMI1 proto-oncogene polycomb ring finger, cyclin D1, CD44, cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, hes family bHLH transcription factor 1, hes related family bHLH transcription factor with YRPW motif 1, MYC, NOTCH3, RE1 silencing transcription factor and transcription factor 7 in a cellular context-dependent manner, while non-canonical Notch signaling activates NF-κB and Rac family small GTPase 1. Notch signaling is aberrantly activated in breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and hematological malignancies, such as T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. However, Notch signaling is inactivated in small-cell lung cancer and squamous cell carcinomas. Loss-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are early events during esophageal tumorigenesis, whereas gain-of-function NOTCH1 mutations are late events during T-cell leukemogenesis and B-cell lymphomagenesis. Notch signaling cascades crosstalk with fibroblast growth factor and WNT signaling cascades in the tumor microenvironment to maintain cancer stem cells and remodel the tumor microenvironment. The Notch signaling network exerts oncogenic and tumor-suppressive effects in a cancer stage- or (sub)type-dependent manner. Small-molecule γ-secretase inhibitors (AL101, MRK-560, nirogacestat and others) and antibody-based biologics targeting Notch ligands or receptors [ABT-165, AMG 119, rovalpituzumab tesirine (Rova-T) and others] have been developed as investigational drugs. The DLL3-targeting antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) Rova-T, and DLL3-targeting chimeric antigen receptor-modified T cells (CAR-Ts), AMG 119, are promising anti-cancer therapeutics, as are other ADCs or CAR-Ts targeting tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 17, CD19, CD22, CD30, CD79B, CD205, Claudin 18.2, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)2, FGFR3, receptor-type tyrosine-protein kinase FLT3, HER2, hepatocyte growth factor receptor, NECTIN4, inactive tyrosine-protein kinase 7, inactive tyrosine-protein kinase transmembrane receptor ROR1 and tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2. ADCs and CAR-Ts could alter the therapeutic framework for refractory cancers, especially diffuse-type gastric cancer, ovarian cancer and pancreatic cancer with peritoneal dissemination. Phase III clinical trials of Rova-T for patients with small-cell lung cancer and a phase III clinical trial of nirogacestat for patients with desmoid tumors are ongoing. Integration of human intelligence, cognitive computing and explainable artificial intelligence is necessary to construct a Notch-related knowledge-base and optimize Notch-targeted therapy for patients with cancer."
2017,A systematic review on ethnomedicines of anti‐cancer plants,"Cancer is a serious health problem and the second leading cause of death around the globe. Present review is an attempt to provide utmost information based on ethno‐pharmacological and toxicological aspects of anti‐cancer plants of the world. A total of 276 articles published in English journals and containing maximum ethnomedicinal information were reviewed using several data sources such as; Google scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed and floras of different countries. A total of 199 anti‐cancer plants were recorded in present review and results indicated that traditional medicines are mostly being use in developing countries for cancer treatment. Traditionally and scientifically skin and breast cancer types gained more focus. Seventy plants were reportedly analyzed for in‐vitro activities while 32 plants were having in‐vivo reports. Twenty nine pure compounds (mostly phenolic) were reportedly isolated from anti‐cancer plants and tested against different cancer cell lines. Inspite having better efficiency of ethnomedicines as compared to synthetic drugs, several plants have also shown toxic effects on living system. Therefore, we invite researchers attention to carry out detailed ethno‐pharmacological and toxicological studies on un‐explored anti‐cancer plants in order to provide reliable knowledge to the patients and develop novel anti‐cancer drugs.

2020,Deep Learning Assisted Efficient AdaBoost Algorithm for Breast Cancer Detection and Early Diagnosis,"Breast cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases and the second largest cause of female cancer death. Breast cancer starts when malignant, cancerous lumps start to grow from the breast cells. Self-tests and Periodic clinical checks help to early diagnosis and thereby improve the survival chances significantly. The breast cancer classification is a medical method that provides researchers and scientists with a great challenge. Neural networks have recently become a popular tool in cancer data classification. In this paper, Deep Learning assisted Efficient Adaboost Algorithm (DLA-EABA) for breast cancer detection has been mathematically proposed with advanced computational techniques. In addition to traditional computer vision approaches, tumor classification methods using transfers are being actively developed through the use of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This study starts with examining the CNN-based transfer learning to characterize breast masses for different diagnostic, predictive tasks or prognostic or in several imaging modalities, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), Ultrasound (US), digital breast tomosynthesis and mammography. The deep learning framework contains several convolutional layers, LSTM, Max-pooling layers. The classification and error estimation that has been included in a fully connected layer and a softmax layer. This paper focuses on combining these machine learning approaches with the methods of selecting features and extracting them through evaluating their output using classification and segmentation techniques to find the most appropriate approach. The experimental results show that the high accuracy level of 97.2%, Sensitivity 98.3%, and Specificity 96.5% has been compared to other existing systems."
2020,Engineering macrophage-derived exosomes for targeted chemotherapy of triple-negative breast cancer.,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most metastatic and recurrent subtype of all breast cancers. Owing to the lack of therapeutic targets, chemotherapy and surgical intervention are the only treatments for TNBC. However, the effectiveness of chemotherapeutics is limited by its shortcomings such as poor targeting, easy removal and high toxicity. Recently, exosomes have attracted more and more attention as a drug delivery system. As endogenous vesicles, exosomes ensure low immunogenicity, nontoxicity, and long blood circulation time. In addition, immune cell-derived exosomes can mimic the immune cell to target tumor cells. Herein, we developed a macrophage-derived exosome-coated poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) nanoplatform for targeted chemotherapy of TNBC. To further improve the tumor targetability, the surface of the exosome was modified with a peptide to target the mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (c-Met), which is overexpressed by TNBC cells. The results showed that the engineered exosome-coated nanoparticles significantly improved the cellular uptake efficiency and the antitumor efficacy of doxorubicin. In vivo study demonstrated that the nanocarriers exhibited remarkable tumor-targeting efficacy, led to increased inhibition of tumor growth and induced intense tumor apoptosis. These results indicated that the engineered macrophage exosome-coated nanoparticles were a promising drug delivery strategy for TNBC treatment."
2019,Quantitative and Specific Detection of Exosomal miRNAs for Accurate Diagnosis of Breast Cancer Using a Surface-Enhanced Raman Scattering Sensor Based on Plasmonic Head-Flocked Gold Nanopillars.,"MicroRNAs in exosomes (exosomal miRNAs) have attracted increased attention as cancer biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis owing to their stability in body fluids. Since strong association exists between exosomal miRNA expression levels and breast cancer, the development of effective methods that can monitor exosomal miRNA expression both over broad concentration ranges and in ultralow amounts is critical. Here, a surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS)-based sensing platform is developed for the quantitative determination of exosomal miRNAs. Ultrasensitive exosomal miRNA detection with single-nucleotide specificity is obtained from enhanced SERS signals from a uniform plasmonic head-flocked gold nanopillar substrate, which generates multiple hotspots and enables hybridization between short oligonucleotides, i.e., miRNAs and locked nucleic acid probes. The proposed SERS sensor shows an extremely low detection limit without any amplification process, a wide dynamic range (1 am to 100 nm), multiplex sensing capability and sound miRNA recovery in serum. Furthermore, this sensor allows reliable observation of exosomal miRNA expression patterns from breast cancer cell lines and can discriminate breast cancer subtype based on the difference between these patterns. The results suggest that this sensor can be used for universal cancer diagnosis and further biomedical applications through the quantitative measurement of exosomal miRNAs in bodily fluids."
2022,A Lightweight Hybrid Dilated Ghost Model-Based Approach for the Prognosis of Breast Cancer,"Most approaches use interactive priors to find tumours and then segment them based on tumour-centric candidates. A fully convolutional network is demonstrated for end-to-end breast tumour segmentation. When confronted with such a variety of options, to enhance tumour detection in digital mammograms, one uses multiscale picture information. Enhanced segmentation precision. The sampling of convolution layers are carefully chosen without adding parameters to prevent overfitting. The loss function is tuned to the tumor pixel fraction during training. Several studies have shown that the recommended method is effective. Tumour segmentation is automated for a variety of tumour sizes and forms postprocessing. Due to an increase in malignant cases, fundamental IoT malignant detection and family categorisation methodologies have been put to the test. In this paper, a novel malignant detection and family categorisation model based on the improved stochastic channel attention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented. The lightweight deep learning model complies with tougher execution, training, and energy limits in practice. The improved stochastic channel attention and DenseNet models are employed to identify malignant cells, followed by family classification. On our datasets, the proposed model detects malignant cells with 99.3 percent accuracy and family categorisation with 98.5 percent accuracy. The model can detect and classify malignancy."
2019,Automated Breast Cancer Diagnosis Based on Machine Learning Algorithms,"There have been several empirical studies addressing breast cancer using machine learning and soft computing techniques. Many claim that their algorithms are faster, easier, or more accurate than others are. This study is based on genetic programming and machine learning algorithms that aim to construct a system to accurately differentiate between benign and malignant breast tumors. The aim of this study was to optimize the learning algorithm. In this context, we applied the genetic programming technique to select the best features and perfect parameter values of the machine learning classifiers. The performance of the proposed method was based on sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, and the roc curves. The present study proves that genetic programming can automatically find the best model by combining feature preprocessing methods and classifier algorithms."
2021,Current Perspectives on the Beneficial Effects of Soybean Isoflavones and Their Metabolites for Humans,"Soybeans are rich in proteins and lipids and have become a staple part of the human diet. Besides their nutritional excellence, they have also been shown to contain various functional components, including isoflavones, and have consequently received increasing attention as a functional food item. Isoflavones are structurally similar to 17-β-estradiol and bind to estrogen receptors (ERα and ERβ). The estrogenic activity of isoflavones ranges from a hundredth to a thousandth of that of estrogen itself. Isoflavones play a role in regulating the effects of estrogen in the human body, depending on the situation. Thus, when estrogen is insufficient, isoflavones perform the functions of estrogen, and when estrogen is excessive, isoflavones block the estrogen receptors to which estrogen binds, thus acting as an estrogen antagonist. In particular, estrogen antagonistic activity is important in the breast, endometrium, and prostate, and such antagonistic activity suppresses cancer occurrence. Genistein, an isoflavone, has cancer-suppressing effects on estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) cancers, including breast cancer. It suppresses the function of enzymes such as tyrosine protein kinase, mitogen-activated kinase, and DNA polymerase II, thus inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. Genistein is the most biologically active and potent isoflavone candidate for cancer prevention. Furthermore, among the various physiological functions of isoflavones, they are best known for their antioxidant activities. S-Equol, a metabolite of genistein and daidzein, has strong antioxidative effects; however, the ability to metabolize daidzein into S-equol varies based on racial and individual differences. The antioxidant activity of isoflavones may be effective in preventing dementia by inhibiting the phosphorylation of Alzheimer’s-related tau proteins. Genistein also reduces allergic responses by limiting the expression of mast cell IgE receptors, which are involved in allergic responses. In addition, they have been known to prevent and treat various diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, metabolic syndromes, osteoporosis, diabetes, brain-related diseases, high blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and inflammation. Further, it also has positive effects on menstrual irregularity in non-menopausal women and relieving menopausal symptoms in middle-aged women. Recently, soybean consumption has shown steep increasing trend in Western countries where the intake was previously only 1/20–1/50 of that in Asian countries. In this review, Ihave dealt with the latest research trends that have shown substantial interest in the biological efficacy of isoflavones in humans and plants, and their related mechanisms."
2023,Evaluating ChatGPT as an Adjunct for Radiologic Decision-Making,"BACKGROUND ChatGPT, a popular new large language model (LLM) built by OpenAI, has shown impressive performance in a number of specialized applications. Despite the rising popularity and performance of AI, studies evaluating the use of LLMs for clinical decision support are lacking. PURPOSE To evaluate ChatGPT's capacity for clinical decision support in radiology via the identification of appropriate imaging services for two important clinical presentations: breast cancer screening and breast pain. MATERIALS AND METHODS We compared ChatGPT's responses to the American College of Radiology (ACR) Appropriateness Criteria for breast pain and breast cancer screening. Our prompt formats included an open-ended (OE) format, where ChatGPT was asked to provide the single most appropriate imaging procedure, and a select all that apply (SATA) format, where ChatGPT was given a list of imaging modalities to assess. Scoring criteria evaluated whether proposed imaging modalities were in accordance with ACR guidelines. RESULTS ChatGPT achieved an average OE score of 1.83 (out of 2) and a SATA average percentage correct of 88.9% for breast cancer screening prompts, and an average OE score of 1.125 (out of 2) and a SATA average percentage correct of 58.3% for breast pain prompts. CONCLUSION Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using ChatGPT for radiologic decision making, with the potential to improve clinical workflow and responsible use of radiology services."
2019,Artificial intelligence in the interpretation of breast cancer on MRI,"Advances in both imaging and computers have led to the rise in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) in various tasks in breast imaging, going beyond the current use in computer‐aided detection to include diagnosis, prognosis, response to therapy, and risk assessment. The automated capabilities of AI offer the potential to enhance the diagnostic expertise of clinicians, including accurate demarcation of tumor volume, extraction of characteristic cancer phenotypes, translation of tumoral phenotype features to clinical genotype implications, and risk prediction. The combination of image‐specific findings with the underlying genomic, pathologic, and clinical features is becoming of increasing value in breast cancer. The concurrent emergence of newer imaging techniques has provided radiologists with greater diagnostic tools and image datasets to analyze and interpret. Integrating an AI‐based workflow within breast imaging enables the integration of multiple data streams into powerful multidisciplinary applications that may lead the path to personalized patient‐specific medicine. In this article we describe the goals of AI in breast cancer imaging, in particular MRI, and review the literature as it relates to the current application, potential, and limitations in breast cancer."
2020,Artificial Intelligence-Based Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histopathology Images Using Faster R-CNN and Deep CNNs,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of mortality in women. Early diagnosis of breast cancer can reduce the mortality rate. In the diagnosis, the mitotic cell count is an important biomarker for predicting the aggressiveness, prognosis, and grade of breast cancer. In general, pathologists manually examine histopathology images under high-resolution microscopes for the detection of mitotic cells. However, because of the minute differences between the mitotic and normal cells, this process is tiresome, time-consuming, and subjective. To overcome these challenges, artificial-intelligence-based (AI-based) techniques have been developed which automatically detect mitotic cells in the histopathology images. Such AI techniques accelerate the diagnosis and can be used as a second-opinion system for a medical doctor. Previously, conventional image-processing techniques were used for the detection of mitotic cells, which have low accuracy and high computational cost. Therefore, a number of deep-learning techniques that demonstrate outstanding performance and low computational cost were recently developed; however, they still require improvement in terms of accuracy and reliability. Therefore, we present a multistage mitotic-cell-detection method based on Faster region convolutional neural network (Faster R-CNN) and deep CNNs. Two open datasets (international conference on pattern recognition (ICPR) 2012 and ICPR 2014 (MITOS-ATYPIA-14)) of breast cancer histopathology were used in our experiments. The experimental results showed that our method achieves the state-of-the-art results of 0.876 precision, 0.841 recall, and 0.858 F1-measure for the ICPR 2012 dataset, and 0.848 precision, 0.583 recall, and 0.691 F1-measure for the ICPR 2014 dataset, which were higher than those obtained using previous methods. Moreover, we tested the generalization capability of our technique by testing on the tumor proliferation assessment challenge 2016 (TUPAC16) dataset and found that our technique also performs well in a cross-dataset experiment which proved the generalization capability of our proposed technique."
2018,Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification: A Deep Learning Approach,"Breast cancer remains the most common type of cancer and the leading cause of cancer-induced mortality among women with 2.4 million new cases diagnosed and 523,000 deaths per year. Historically, a diagnosis has been initially performed using clinical screening followed by histopathological analysis. Automated classification of cancers using histopathological images is a chciteallenging task of accurate detection of tumor sub-types. This process could be facilitated by machine learning approaches, which may be more reliable and economical compared to conventional methods. To prove this principle, we applied fine-tuned pre-trained deep neural networks. To test the approach we first classify different cancer types using 6, 402 tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) training samples. Our framework accurately detected on average 99.8% of the four cancer types including breast, bladder, lung and lymphoma using the ResNet V1 50 pre-trained model. Then, for classification of breast cancer sub-types this approach was applied to 7,909 images from the BreakHis database. In the next step, ResNet V1 152 classified benign and malignant breast cancers with an accuracy of 98.7%. In addition, ResNet V1 50 and ResNet V1 152 categorized either benign- (adenosis, fibroadenoma, phyllodes tumor, and tubular adenoma) or malignant- (ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma) sub-types with 94.8% and 96.4% accuracy, respectively. The confusion matrices revealed high sensitivity values of 1, 0.995 and 0.993 for cancer types, as well as malignant- and benign sub-types respectively. The areas under the curve (AUC) scores were 0.996,0.973 and 0.996 for cancer types, malignant and benign sub-types, respectively. Overall, our results show negligible false negative (on average 3.7 samples) and false positive (on average 2 samples) results among different models.

2016,Low‐Dose Bisphenol A Exposure: A Seemingly Instigating Carcinogenic Effect on Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the world and the second most common fatal cancer in women. Epidemiological studies and clinical data have indicated that hormones, including estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin, play important roles in the initiation and progression of breast cancer. Bisphenol A (BPA) is one of the most commonly used and thoroughly studied endocrine disruptors. It can be released from consumer products and deposited in the environment, thus creating potential for human exposure through oral, inhaled, and dermal routes. Some recent reviews have summarized the known mechanisms of endocrine disruptions by BPA in human diseases, including obesity, reproductive disorders, and birth defects. However, large knowledge gaps still exist on the roles BPA may play in cancer initiation and development. Evidence from animal and in vitro studies has suggested an association between increased incidence of breast cancer and BPA exposure at doses below the safe reference doses that are the most environmentally relevant. Most current studies have paid little attention to the cancer‐promoting properties of BPA at low doses. In this review, recent findings on the carcinogenic effects of low‐dose BPA on breast cancer and discussed possible biologic mechanisms are summarized."
2018,Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning Algorithms,"The most frequently occuring cancer among Indian women is breast cancer. There is a chance of fifty percent for fatality in a case as one of two women diagnosed with breast cancer die in the cases of Indian women [1]. This paper aims to present comparison of the largely popular machine learning algorithms and techniques commonly used for breast cancer prediction, namely Random Forest, kNN (k-Nearest-Neighbor) and Naïve Bayes. The Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer data set was used as a training set to compare the performance of the various machine learning techniques in terms of key parameters such as accuracy, and precision. The results obtained are very competitive and can be used for detection and treatment."
2018,Canine mammary tumors as a model for human disease,"Animal models for examining human breast cancer (HBC) carcinogenesis have been extensively studied and proposed. With the recent advent of immunotherapy, significant attention has been focused on the dog as a model for human cancer. Dogs develop mammary tumors and other cancer types spontaneously with an intact immune system, which exhibit a number of clinical and molecular similarities to HBC. In addition to the spontaneous tumor presentation, the clinical similarities between human and canine mammary tumors (CMT) include the age at onset, hormonal etiology and course of the diseases. Furthermore, factors that affect the disease outcome, including tumor size, stage and lymph node invasion, are similar in HBC and CMT. Similarly, the molecular characteristics of steroid receptor, epidermal growth factor, proliferation marker, metalloproteinase and cyclooxygenase expression, and the mutation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene in CMT, mimic HBC. Furthermore, ductal carcinomas in situ in human and canine mammary glands are particularly similar in their pathological, molecular and visual characteristics. These CMT characteristics and their similarities to HBC indicate that the dog could be an excellent model for the study of human disease. These similarities are discussed in detail in the present review, and are compared with the in vitro and other in vivo animal models available."
2016,Understanding and effectively addressing breast cancer in African American women: Unpacking the social context,"Black women have a higher incidence of breast cancer before the age of 40 years, more severe disease at all ages, and an elevated mortality risk in comparison with white women. There is limited understanding of the contribution of social factors to these patterns. Elucidating the role of the social determinants of health in breast cancer disparities requires greater attention to how risk factors for breast cancer unfold over the lifecourse and to the complex ways in which socioeconomic status and racism shape exposure to psychosocial, physical, chemical, and other individual and community‐level assaults that increase the risk of breast cancer. Research that takes seriously the social context in which black women live is also needed to maximize the opportunities to prevent breast cancer in this underserved group.

2020,Non-Invasive Biomarkers for Early Detection of Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary Early diagnosis of breast cancer greatly increases the chance of cure and survival from the disease. The mammogram is widely used for early detection of breast cancer, but its effectiveness and accuracy have been a concern for a long time as well as its inability in detecting small cancers, especially in women with dense breast tissues. Therefore, it is an unmet clinical need to develop a simple, convenient test to overcome the shortcomings of mammography. Liquid biopsy, which is based on the analysis of body fluids, has attracted much attention in the search for cancer biomarkers. Recent advances in analytical techniques have gradually made it possible to detect breast cancer early through a biomarker analysis of blood, nipple aspirate fluid, sweat, urine, tears, or the breath. We envision that a simple blood or breath test holds great promise as a biomarker for early detection of breast cancer in the near future. Abstract Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. Accurate early diagnosis of breast cancer is critical in the management of the disease. Although mammogram screening has been widely used for breast cancer screening, high false-positive and false-negative rates and radiation from mammography have always been a concern. Over the last 20 years, the emergence of “omics” strategies has resulted in significant advances in the search for non-invasive biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis at an early stage. Circulating carcinoma antigens, circulating tumor cells, circulating cell-free tumor nucleic acids (DNA or RNA), circulating microRNAs, and circulating extracellular vesicles in the peripheral blood, nipple aspirate fluid, sweat, urine, and tears, as well as volatile organic compounds in the breath, have emerged as potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers to supplement current clinical approaches to earlier detection of breast cancer. In this review, we summarize the current progress of research in these areas."
2021,Paclitaxel: Application in Modern Oncology and Nanomedicine-Based Cancer Therapy,"Paclitaxel is a broad-spectrum anticancer compound, which was derived mainly from a medicinal plant, in particular, from the bark of the yew tree Taxus brevifolia Nutt. It is a representative of a class of diterpene taxanes, which are nowadays used as the most common chemotherapeutic agent against many forms of cancer. It possesses scientifically proven anticancer activity against, e.g., ovarian, lung, and breast cancers. The application of this compound is difficult because of limited solubility, recrystalization upon dilution, and cosolvent-induced toxicity. In these cases, nanotechnology and nanoparticles provide certain advantages such as increased drug half-life, lowered toxicity, and specific and selective delivery over free drugs. Nanodrugs possess the capability to buildup in the tissue which might be linked to enhanced permeability and retention as well as enhanced antitumour influence possessing minimal toxicity in normal tissues. This article presents information about paclitaxel, its chemical structure, formulations, mechanism of action, and toxicity. Attention is drawn on nanotechnology, the usefulness of nanoparticles containing paclitaxel, its opportunities, and also future perspective. This review article is aimed at summarizing the current state of continuous pharmaceutical development and employment of nanotechnology in the enhancement of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic features of paclitaxel as a chemotherapeutic agent."
2021,Immune Infiltrates in Breast Cancer: Recent Updates and Clinical Implications,"In recent decades, the increasing interest in the field of immunotherapy has fostered an intense investigation of the breast cancer (BC) immune microenvironment. In this context, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a clinically relevant and highly reproducible biomarker capable of affecting BC prognosis and response to treatment. Indeed, the evaluation of TILs on primary tumors proved to be strongly prognostic in triple-negative (TN) BC patients treated with either adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy, as well as in early TNBC patients not receiving any systemic treatment, thus gaining level-1b evidence in this setting. In addition, a strong relationship between TILs and pathologic complete response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been reported in all BC subtypes and the prognostic role of higher TILs in early HER2-positive breast cancer patients has also been demonstrated. The interest in BC immune infiltrates has been further fueled by the introduction of the first immune checkpoint inhibitors in the treatment armamentarium of advanced TNBC in patients with PD-L1-positive status by FDA-approved assays. However, despite these advances, a biomarker capable of reliably and exhaustively predicting immunotherapy benefit in BC is still lacking, highlighting the imperative need to further deepen this issue. Finally, more comprehensive evaluation of immune infiltrates integrating both the quantity and quality of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and incorporation of TILs in composite scores encompassing other clinically or biologically relevant biomarkers, as well as the adoption of software-based and/or machine learning platforms for a more comprehensive characterization of BC immune infiltrates, are emerging as promising strategies potentially capable of optimizing patient selection and stratification in the research field. In the present review, we summarize available evidence and recent updates on immune infiltrates in BC, focusing on current clinical applications, potential clinical implications and major unresolved issues."
2014,Copper-64-alloyed gold nanoparticles for cancer imaging: improved radiolabel stability and diagnostic accuracy.,"Gold nanoparticles, especially positron-emitter- labeled gold nanostructures, have gained steadily increasing attention in biomedical applications. Of the radionuclides used for nanoparticle positron emission tomography imaging, radiometals such as (64) Cu have been widely employed. Currently, radiolabeling through macrocyclic chelators is the most commonly used strategy. However, the radiolabel stability may be a limiting factor for further translational research. We report the integration of (64) Cu into the structures of gold nanoparticles. With this approach, the specific radioactivity of the alloyed gold nanoparticles could be freely and precisely controlled by the addition of the precursor (64) CuCl2 to afford sensitive detection. The direct incorporation of (64) Cu into the lattice of the gold nanoparticle structure ensured the radiolabel stability for accurate localization in vivo. The superior pharmacokinetic and positron emission tomography imaging capabilities demonstrate high passive tumor targeting and contrast ratios in a mouse breast cancer model, as well as the great potential of this unique alloyed nanostructure for preclinical and translational imaging."
2022,Hybrid Model for Detection of Cervical Cancer Using Causal Analysis and Machine Learning Techniques,"Cervical cancer has become the third most common form of cancer in the in-universe, after the widespread breast cancer. Human papillomavirus risk of infection is linked to the majority of cancer cases. Preventive care, the most expensive way of fighting cancer, can protect about 37% of cancer cases. The Pap smear examination is a standard screening procedure for the initial screening of cervical cancer. However, this manual test procedure generates many false-positive outcomes due to individual errors. Various researchers have extensively investigated machine learning (ML) methods for classifying cervical Pap cells to enhance manual testing. The random forest method is the most popular method for anticipating features from a high-dimensional cancer image dataset. However, the random forest method can get too slow and inefficient for real-time forecasts when too many decision trees are used. This research proposed an efficient feature selection and prediction model for cervical cancer datasets using Boruta analysis and SVM method to deal with this challenge. A Boruta analysis method is used. It is improved from of random forest method and mainly discovers feature subsets from the data source that are significant to assigned classification activity. The proposed model's primary aim is to determine the importance of cervical cancer screening factors for classifying high-risk patients depending on the findings. This research work analyses cervical cancer and various risk factors to help detect cervical cancer. The proposed model Boruta with SVM and various popular ML models are implemented using Python and various performance measuring parameters, i.e., accuracy, precision, F1–Score, and recall. However, the proposed Boruta analysis with SVM performs outstanding over existing methods."
2019,Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Mammograms—A Comparative Study,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are investigated in the context of computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) of breast cancer. State-of-the-art CNNs are trained and evaluated on two mammographic datasets, consisting of ROIs depicting benign or malignant mass lesions. The performance evaluation of each examined network is addressed in two training scenarios: the first involves initializing the network with pre-trained weights, while for the second the networks are initialized in a random fashion. Extensive experimental results show the superior performance achieved in the case of fine-tuning a pretrained network compared to training from scratch."
2016,Comparative study of machine learning algorithms for breast cancer detection and diagnosis,"Breast cancer is one of the most widespread diseases among women in the UAE and worldwide. Correct and early diagnosis is an extremely important step in rehabilitation and treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several uncertainties in detection using mammograms. Machine Learning (ML) techniques can be used to develop tools for physicians that can be used as an effective mechanism for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer which will greatly enhance the survival rate of patients. This paper compares three of the most popular ML techniques commonly used for breast cancer detection and diagnosis, namely Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and Bayesian Networks (BN). The Wisconsin original breast cancer data set was used as a training set to evaluate and compare the performance of the three ML classifiers in terms of key parameters such as accuracy, recall, precision and area of ROC. The results obtained in this paper provide an overview of the state of art ML techniques for breast cancer detection."
2019,An RDAU-NET model for lesion segmentation in breast ultrasound images,"Breast cancer is a common gynecological disease that poses a great threat to women health due to its high malignant rate. Breast cancer screening tests are used to find any warning signs or symptoms for early detection and currently, Ultrasound screening is the preferred method for breast cancer diagnosis. The localization and segmentation of the lesions in breast ultrasound (BUS) images are helpful for clinical diagnosis of the disease. In this paper, an RDAU-NET (Residual-Dilated-Attention-Gate-UNet) model is proposed and employed to segment the tumors in BUS images. The model is based on the conventional U-Net, but the plain neural units are replaced with residual units to enhance the edge information and overcome the network performance degradation problem associated with deep networks. To increase the receptive field and acquire more characteristic information, dilated convolutions were used to process the feature maps obtained from the encoder stages. The traditional cropping and copying between the encoder-decoder pipelines were replaced by the Attention Gate modules which enhanced the learning capabilities through suppression of background information. The model, when tested with BUS images with benign and malignant tumor presented excellent segmentation results as compared to other Deep Networks. A variety of quantitative indicators including Accuracy, Dice coefficient, AUC(Area-Under-Curve), Precision, Sensitivity, Specificity, Recall, F1score and M-IOU (Mean-Intersection-Over-Union) provided performances above 80%. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed RDAU-NET model can accurately segment breast lesions when compared to other deep learning models and thus has a good prospect for clinical diagnosis."
2014,Paradoxic effects of metformin on endothelial cells and angiogenesis,"The biguanide metformin is used in type 2 diabetes management and has gained significant attention as a potential cancer preventive agent. Angioprevention represents a mechanism of chemoprevention, yet conflicting data concerning the antiangiogenic action of metformin have emerged. Here, we clarify some of the contradictory effects of metformin on endothelial cells and angiogenesis, using in vitro and in vivo assays combined with transcriptomic and protein array approaches. Metformin inhibits formation of capillary-like networks by endothelial cells; this effect is partially dependent on the energy sensor adenosine-monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as shown by small interfering RNA knockdown. Gene expression profiling of human umbilical vein endothelial cells revealed a paradoxical modulation of several angiogenesis-associated genes and proteins by metformin, with short-term induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), cyclooxygenase 2 and CXC chemokine receptor 4 at the messenger RNA level and downregulation of ADAMTS1. Antibody array analysis shows an essentially opposite regulation of numerous angiogenesis-associated proteins in endothelial and breast cancer cells including interleukin-8, angiogenin and TIMP-1, as well as selective regulation of angiopioetin-1, -2, endoglin and others. Endothelial cell production of the cytochrome P450 member CYP1B1 is upregulated by tumor cell supernatants in an AMPK-dependent manner, metformin blocks this effect. Metformin inhibits VEGF-dependent activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and the inhibition of AMPK activity abrogates this event. Metformin hinders angiogenesis in matrigel pellets in vivo, prevents the microvessel density increase observed in obese mice on a high-fat diet, downregulating the number of white adipose tissue endothelial precursor cells. Our data show that metformin has an antiangiogenic activity in vitro and in vivo associated with a contradictory short-term enhancement of pro-angiogenic mediators, as well as with a differential regulation in endothelial and breast cancer cells."
2020,A Comparative Analysis of Breast Cancer Detection and Diagnosis Using Data Visualization and Machine Learning Applications,"In the developing world, cancer death is one of the major problems for humankind. Even though there are many ways to prevent it before happening, some cancer types still do not have any treatment. One of the most common cancer types is breast cancer, and early diagnosis is the most important thing in its treatment. Accurate diagnosis is one of the most important processes in breast cancer treatment. In the literature, there are many studies about predicting the type of breast tumors. In this research paper, data about breast cancer tumors from Dr. William H. Walberg of the University of Wisconsin Hospital were used for making predictions on breast tumor types. Data visualization and machine learning techniques including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, naïve Bayes, decision tree, random forest, and rotation forest were applied to this dataset. R, Minitab, and Python were chosen to be applied to these machine learning techniques and visualization. The paper aimed to make a comparative analysis using data visualization and machine learning applications for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. Diagnostic performances of applications were comparable for detecting breast cancers. Data visualization and machine learning techniques can provide significant benefits and impact cancer detection in the decision-making process. In this paper, different machine learning and data mining techniques for the detection of breast cancer were proposed. Results obtained with the logistic regression model with all features included showed the highest classification accuracy (98.1%), and the proposed approach revealed the enhancement in accuracy performances. These results indicated the potential to open new opportunities in the detection of breast cancer."
2018,Application of Machine Learning in Disease Prediction,"The application of machine learning in the field of medical diagnosis is increasing gradually. This can be contributed primarily to the improvement in the classification and recognition systems used in disease diagnosis which is able to provide data that aids medical experts in early detection of fatal diseases and therefore, increase the survival rate of patients significantly. In this paper, we apply different classification algorithms, each with its own advantage on three separate databases of disease (Heart, Breast cancer, Diabetes) available in UCI repository for disease prediction. The feature selection for each dataset was accomplished by backward modeling using the p-value test. The results of the study strengthen the idea of the application of machine learning in early detection of diseases."
2016,The Anti-Cancer Effect of Polyphenols against Breast Cancer and Cancer Stem Cells: Molecular Mechanisms,"The high incidence of breast cancer in developed and developing countries, and its correlation to cancer-related deaths, has prompted concerned scientists to discover novel alternatives to deal with this challenge. In this review, we will provide a brief overview of polyphenol structures and classifications, as well as on the carcinogenic process. The biology of breast cancer cells will also be discussed. The molecular mechanisms involved in the anti-cancer activities of numerous polyphenols, against a wide range of breast cancer cells, in vitro and in vivo, will be explained in detail. The interplay between autophagy and apoptosis in the anti-cancer activity of polyphenols will also be highlighted. In addition, the potential of polyphenols to target cancer stem cells (CSCs) via various mechanisms will be explained. Recently, the use of natural products as chemotherapeutics and chemopreventive drugs to overcome the side effects and resistance that arise from using chemical-based agents has garnered the attention of the scientific community. Polyphenol research is considered a promising field in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer."
2019,Predicting Breast Cancer by Applying Deep Learning to Linked Health Records and Mammograms.,"Background Computational models on the basis of deep neural networks are increasingly used to analyze health care data. However, the efficacy of traditional computational models in radiology is a matter of debate. Purpose To evaluate the accuracy and efficiency of a combined machine and deep learning approach for early breast cancer detection applied to a linked set of digital mammography images and electronic health records. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 52 936 images were collected in 13 234 women who underwent at least one mammogram between 2013 and 2017, and who had health records for at least 1 year before undergoing mammography. The algorithm was trained on 9611 mammograms and health records of women to make two breast cancer predictions: to predict biopsy malignancy and to differentiate normal from abnormal screening examinations. The study estimated the association of features with outcomes by using t test and Fisher exact test. The model comparisons were performed with a 95% confidence interval (CI) or by using the DeLong test. Results The resulting algorithm was validated in 1055 women and tested in 2548 women (mean age, 55 years ± 10 [standard deviation]). In the test set, the algorithm identified 34 of 71 (48%) false-negative findings on mammograms. For the malignancy prediction objective, the algorithm obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.93), with specificity of 77.3% (95% CI: 69.2%, 85.4%) at a sensitivity of 87%. When trained on clinical data alone, the model performed significantly better than the Gail model (AUC, 0.78 vs 0.54, respectively; P < .004). Conclusion The algorithm, which combined machine-learning and deep-learning approaches, can be applied to assess breast cancer at a level comparable to radiologists and has the potential to substantially reduce missed diagnoses of breast cancer. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2016,The Emerging Roles of Long Noncoding RNA ROR (lincRNA-ROR) and its Possible Mechanisms in Human Cancers,"To date, there is only up to 2% of protein-coding genes that are stably transcribed, whereas the vast majority are non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). These ncRNAs, also known as non-messenger RNAs (nmRNAs) or functional RNAs (fRNAs), include transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, microRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). With the advance of high-resolution microarrays and massively parallel sequencing technology, lncRNAs have gained extended attentions nowadays and are found to play important roles in tumorigenesis and progression of human cancers. Long intergenic non-protein coding RNA, regulator of reprogramming (linc-ROR), was first discovered in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), where it was controlled by the key pluripotency factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog. Linc-ROR has been shown to be dysregulated in many types of cancers, including breast cancer (BC), pancreatic cancer (PC), hepatocellular cancer (HCC), endometrial cancer (EC), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Also, linc-ROR functions as regulatory molecule in a large amount of biological processes. However, the underlying mechanisms of its contribution to carcinogenesis remain to be elucidated. In this review, we will emphasize on the characteristics of linc-ROR and their roles in different types of human cancers."
2018,Deep learning beyond cats and dogs: recent advances in diagnosing breast cancer with deep neural networks.,"Deep learning has demonstrated tremendous revolutionary changes in the computing industry and its effects in radiology and imaging sciences have begun to dramatically change screening paradigms. Specifically, these advances have influenced the development of computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) systems. These technologies have long been thought of as ""second-opinion"" tools for radiologists and clinicians. However, with significant improvements in deep neural networks, the diagnostic capabilities of learning algorithms are approaching levels of human expertise (radiologists, clinicians etc.), shifting the CAD paradigm from a ""second opinion"" tool to a more collaborative utility. This paper reviews recently developed CAD systems based on deep learning technologies for breast cancer diagnosis, explains their superiorities with respect to previously established systems, defines the methodologies behind the improved achievements including algorithmic developments, and describes remaining challenges in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. We also discuss possible future directions for new CAD models that continue to change as artificial intelligence algorithms evolve."
2021,Artificial intelligence system reduces false-positive findings in the interpretation of breast ultrasound exams,"Though consistently shown to detect mammographically occult cancers, breast ultrasound has been noted to have high false-positive rates. In this work, we present an AI system that achieves radiologist-level accuracy in identifying breast cancer in ultrasound images. Developed on 288,767 exams, consisting of 5,442,907 B-mode and Color Doppler images, the AI achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.976 on a test set consisting of 44,755 exams. In a retrospective reader study, the AI achieves a higher AUROC than the average of ten board-certified breast radiologists (AUROC: 0.962 AI, 0.924 ± 0.02 radiologists). With the help of the AI, radiologists decrease their false positive rates by 37.3% and reduce requested biopsies by 27.8%, while maintaining the same level of sensitivity. This highlights the potential of AI in improving the accuracy, consistency, and efficiency of breast ultrasound diagnosis. Ultrasound is an important imaging modality for the detection and characterization of breast cancer, but it has been noted to have high false-positive rates. Here, the authors present an artificial intelligence system that achieves radiologist-level accuracy in identifying breast cancer in ultrasound imaging."
2019,Breast Cancer Prognosis Using a Machine Learning Approach,"Machine learning (ML) has been recently introduced to develop prognostic classification models that can be used to predict outcomes in individual cancer patients. Here, we report the significance of an ML-based decision support system (DSS), combined with random optimization (RO), to extract prognostic information from routinely collected demographic, clinical and biochemical data of breast cancer (BC) patients. A DSS model was developed in a training set (n = 318), whose performance analysis in the testing set (n = 136) resulted in a C-index for progression-free survival of 0.84, with an accuracy of 86%. Furthermore, the model was capable of stratifying the testing set into two groups of patients with low- or high-risk of progression with a hazard ratio (HR) of 10.9 (p < 0.0001). Validation in multicenter prospective studies and appropriate management of privacy issues in relation to digital electronic health records (EHR) data are presently needed. Nonetheless, we may conclude that the implementation of ML algorithms and RO models into EHR data might help to achieve prognostic information, and has the potential to revolutionize the practice of personalized medicine."
2017,Predicting Response to Platin Chemotherapy Agents with Biochemically-inspired Machine Learning,"Selection of effective drugs that accurately predict chemotherapy response could improve cancer outcomes. We derive optimized gene signatures for response to common platinum-based drugs, cisplatin, carboplatin, and oxaliplatin, and respectively validate each with bladder, ovarian, and colon cancer patient data. Initially, using breast cancer cell line gene expression and growth inhibition (GI50) data, we performed backwards feature selection with cross-validation to derive predictive gene sets in a supervised support vector machine (SVM) learning approach. These signatures were also verified in bladder cancer cell lines. Aside from published associations between drugs and genes, we also expanded these gene signatures using a systems biology approach. Signatures at different GI50 thresholds distinguishing sensitivity from resistance to each drug contrast the contributions of different genes at extreme vs. median thresholds. An ensemble machine learning technique combining different GI50 thresholds was used to create threshold independent gene signatures. The most accurate models for each platinum drug in cell lines consisted of cisplatin: BARD1, BCL2, BCL2L1, CDKN2C, FAAP24, FEN1, MAP3K1, MAPK13, MAPK3, NFKB1, NFKB2, SLC22A5, SLC31A2, TLR4, TWIST1; carboplatin: AKT1, EIF3K, ERCC1, GNGT1, GSR, MTHFR, NEDD4L, NLRP1, NRAS, RAF1, SGK1, TIGD1, TP53, VEGFB, VEGFC; and oxaliplatin: BRAF, FCGR2A, IGF1, MSH2, NAGK, NFE2L2, NQO1, PANK3, SLC47A1, SLCO1B1, UGT1A1. Recurrence in bladder urothelial carcinoma patients from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) treated with cisplatin after 18 months was 71% accurate (59% in disease-free patients). In carboplatin-treated ovarian cancer patients, predicted recurrence was 60.2% (61% disease-free) accurate after 4 years, while the oxaliplatin signature predicted disease-free colorectal cancer patients with 72% accuracy (54.5% for recurrence) after 1 year. The best performing cisplatin model best predicted outcome for non-smoking TCGA bladder cancer patients (100% accuracy for recurrent, 57% for disease-free; N=19), the median GI50 model (GI50 = 5.12) predicted outcome in smokers with 79% with recurrence, and 62% who were disease free; N=35). Cisplatin and carboplatin signatures were comprised of overlapping gene sets and GI50 values, which contrasted with models for oxaliplatin response."
2019,Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the early detection of breast cancer: a scoping review to assess AI’s potential in breast screening practice,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Various factors are driving interest in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) for breast cancer (BC) detection, but it is unclear whether the evidence warrants large-scale use in population-based screening. Areas covered: We performed a scoping review, a structured evidence synthesis describing a broad research field, to summarize knowledge on AI evaluated for BC detection and to assess AI’s readiness for adoption in BC screening. Studies were predominantly small retrospective studies based on highly selected image datasets that contained a high proportion of cancers (median BC proportion in datasets 26.5%), and used heterogeneous techniques to develop AI models; the range of estimated AUC (area under ROC curve) for AI models was 69.2–97.8% (median AUC 88.2%). We identified various methodologic limitations including use of non-representative imaging data for model training, limited validation in external datasets, potential bias in training data, and few comparative data for AI versus radiologists’ interpretation of mammography screening. Expert opinion: Although contemporary AI models have reported generally good accuracy for BC detection, methodological concerns, and evidence gaps exist that limit translation into clinical BC screening settings. These should be addressed in parallel to advancing AI techniques to render AI transferable to large-scale population-based screening."
2019,Convolutional neural networks for computer-aided detection or diagnosis in medical image analysis: An overview.,"Computer-aided detection or diagnosis (CAD) has been a promising area of research over the last two decades. Medical image analysis aims to provide a more efficient diagnostic and treatment process for the radiologists and clinicians. However, with the development of science and technology, data interpretation manually in the conventional CAD systems has gradually become a challenging task. Deep learning methods, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), are successfully used as tools to solve this problem. This includes applications such as breast cancer diagnosis, lung nodule detection and prostate cancer localization. In this overview, the current state-of-the-art medical image analysis techniques in CAD research are presented, which focus on the convolutional neural network (CNN) based methods. The commonly used medical image databases in literature are also listed. It is anticipated that this paper can provide researchers in radiomics, precision medicine, and imaging grouping with a systematic picture of the CNN-based methods used in CAD research."
2017,Prediction of breast cancer using support vector machine and K-Nearest neighbors,"Breast Cancer is one of the most exquisite and internecine disease among all of the diseases in medical science. It is one of the crucial reasons of death among the females all over the world. We present a novel modality for the prediction of breast cancer and introduces with the Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors which are the supervised machine learning techniques for breast cancer detection by training its attributes. The proposed system uses 10-fold cross validation to get an accurate outcome. The breast cancer termed as Wisconsin breast cancer diagnosis data set is taken from UCI machine learning repository. The performance of the proposed system is appraised considering accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, false discovery rate, false omission rate and Matthews correlation coefficient. The approach provides better result both for training and testing. Furthermore, the techniques achieved the accuracy of 98.57% and 97.14% by Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbors individually along with the specificity of 95.65% and 92.31% in testing phase."
2019,Machine Learning Classification Techniques for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Breast cancer is one of the most widely spread disease and the second leading cause of cancer death among women. Breast cancer starts when malignant lumps which are cancerous begin to grow from the breast cells. Doctors may wrongly diagnose benign tumor (which is non-cancerous) as malignant tumor. There is need for a computer aided detection (CAD) systems which uses machine learning approach to provide accurate diagnosis of breast cancer. These CAD systems can aid in detecting breast cancer at an early stage. When, breast cancer is detected early enough, the survival rate increases because better treatment can be provided. This paper aims at investigating Support Vector Machine (using radial basis kernel), Artificial Neural Networks and Naïve Bayes using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) Dataset. The focus of this paper is to integrate these machine learning techniques with feature selection/feature extraction methods and compare their performances to identify the most suitable approach. The goal is combining the advantages of dimensionality reduction and machine learning. This paper proposed a hybrid approach for breast cancer diagnosis by reducing the high dimensionality of features using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and then applying the new reduced feature dataset to Support Vector Machine. The proposed approach obtained an accuracy of 98.82%, sensitivity of 98.41%, specificity of 99.07% and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.9994."
2019,Robust breast cancer detection in mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis using annotation-efficient deep learning approach,"Breast cancer remains a global challenge, causing over 1 million deaths globally in 2018. To achieve earlier breast cancer detection, screening x-ray mammography is recommended by health organizations worldwide and has been estimated to decrease breast cancer mortality by 20-40%. Nevertheless, significant false positive and false negative rates, as well as high interpretation costs, leave opportunities for improving quality and access. To address these limitations, there has been much recent interest in applying deep learning to mammography; however, obtaining large amounts of annotated data poses a challenge for training deep learning models for this purpose, as does ensuring generalization beyond the populations represented in the training dataset. Here, we present an annotation-efficient deep learning approach that 1) achieves state-of-the-art performance in mammogram classification, 2) successfully extends to digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT; ""3D mammography""), 3) detects cancers in clinically-negative prior mammograms of cancer patients, 4) generalizes well to a population with low screening rates, and 5) outperforms five-out-of-five full-time breast imaging specialists by improving absolute sensitivity by an average of 14%. Our results demonstrate promise towards software that can improve the accuracy of and access to screening mammography worldwide."
2018,Actively Targeted Deep Tissue Imaging and Photothermal‐Chemo Therapy of Breast Cancer by Antibody‐Functionalized Drug‐Loaded X‐Ray‐Responsive Bismuth Sulfide@Mesoporous Silica Core–Shell Nanoparticles,"A theranostic platform combining synergistic therapy and real‐time imaging attracts enormous attention but still faces great challenges, such as tedious modifications and lack of efficient accumulation in tumor. Here, a novel type of theranostic agent, bismuth sulfide@mesoporous silica (Bi2S3@mPS) core‐shell nanoparticles (NPs), for targeted image‐guided therapy of human epidermal growth factor receptor‐2 (HER‐2) positive breast cancer is developed. To generate such NPs, polyvinylpyrrolidone decorated rod‐like Bi2S3 NPs are chemically encapsulated with a mesoporous silica (mPS) layer and loaded with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin. The resultant NPs are then chemically conjugated with trastuzumab (Tam, a monoclonal antibody targeting HER‐2 overexpressed breast cancer cells) to form Tam‐Bi2S3@mPS NPs. By in vitro and in vivo studies, it is demonstrated that the Tam‐Bi2S3@mPS bear multiple desired features for cancer theranostics, including good biocompatibility and drug loading ability as well as precise and active tumor targeting and accumulation (with a bismuth content in tumor being ≈16 times that of nontargeted group). They can simultaneously serve both as an excellent contrast enhancement probe (due to the presence of strong X‐ray‐attenuating bismuth element) for computed tomography deep tissue tumor imaging and as a therapeutic agent to destruct tumors and prevent metastasis by synergistic photothermal‐chemo therapy."
2019,Attention Dense-U-Net for Automatic Breast Mass Segmentation in Digital Mammogram,"Breast mass is one of the most distinctive signs for the diagnosis of breast cancer, and the accurate segmentation of masses is critical for improving the accuracy of breast cancer detection and reducing the mortality rate. It is time-consuming for a physician to review the film. Besides, traditional medical segmentation techniques often require prior knowledge or manual extraction of features, which often lead to a subjective diagnosis. Therefore, developing an automatic image segmentation method is important for clinical application. In this paper, a fully automatic method based on deep learning for breast mass segmentation is proposed, which combines densely connected U-Net with attention gates (AGs). It contains an encoder and a decoder. The encoder is a densely connected convolutional network and the decoder is the decoder of U-Net integrated with AGs. The proposed method is tested on the public and authoritative database—Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) database. F1-score, mean intersection over union, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that dense U-Net integrated AGs achieve better segmentation results than U-Net, attention U-Net, DenseNet, and state-of-the-art methods."
2021,Toward robust mammography-based models for breast cancer risk,"An algorithm to predict breast cancer risk, Mirai, outperforms clinical risk models across test cohorts from the United States, Sweden, and Taiwan. Don’t risk it Mammograms are a common but imperfect way of assessing breast cancer risk. Current U.S. breast cancer screening guidelines all use a component of cancer risk assessment to inform clinical course. Yala et al. developed a machine learning model called “Mirai” to predict breast cancer risk based on traditional mammograms. The authors’ risk model performed better than Tyrer-Cuzick and previous deep learning models at identifying both 5-year breast cancer risk and high-risk patients across multiple international cohorts. Mirai also performed similarly across race and ethnicity categories, suggesting the potential for improvement in patient care across the board. Improved breast cancer risk models enable targeted screening strategies that achieve earlier detection and less screening harm than existing guidelines. To bring deep learning risk models to clinical practice, we need to further refine their accuracy, validate them across diverse populations, and demonstrate their potential to improve clinical workflows. We developed Mirai, a mammography-based deep learning model designed to predict risk at multiple timepoints, leverage potentially missing risk factor information, and produce predictions that are consistent across mammography machines. Mirai was trained on a large dataset from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) in the United States and tested on held-out test sets from MGH, Karolinska University Hospital in Sweden, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) in Taiwan, obtaining C-indices of 0.76 (95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 0.80), 0.81 (0.79 to 0.82), and 0.79 (0.79 to 0.83), respectively. Mirai obtained significantly higher 5-year ROC AUCs than the Tyrer-Cuzick model (P < 0.001) and prior deep learning models Hybrid DL (P < 0.001) and Image-Only DL (P < 0.001), trained on the same dataset. Mirai more accurately identified high-risk patients than prior methods across all datasets. On the MGH test set, 41.5% (34.4 to 48.5) of patients who would develop cancer within 5 years were identified as high risk, compared with 36.1% (29.1 to 42.9) by Hybrid DL (P = 0.02) and 22.9% (15.9 to 29.6) by the Tyrer-Cuzick model (P < 0.001)."
2018,Targeting Breast Cancer Stem Cells to Overcome Treatment Resistance,"Despite advances in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, many patients still fail therapy, resulting in disease progression, recurrence, and reduced overall survival. Historically, much focus has been put on the intrinsic subtyping based in the presence (or absence) of classical immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers such as estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor-related protein (HER2). However, it is widely understood that tumors are composed of heterogeneous populations of cells with a hierarchical organization driven by cancer stem cells (CSCs). In breast tumors, this small population of cells displaying stem cell properties is known as breast CSCs (BCSCs). This rare population exhibit a CD44+/CD24−/low phenotype with high ALDH activity (ALDH+), and possesses higher tolerability to chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and radiotherapy and is able to reproduce the bulk of the tumor after reduction of cell populations sensitive to first-line therapy leading to disease relapse. In this review, we present special attention to BCSCs with future directions in the establishment of a therapy targeting this population. Drugs targeting the main BCSCs signaling pathways undergoing clinical trials are also summarized."
2021,Breast Cancer Type Classification Using Machine Learning,"Background: Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease defined by molecular types and subtypes. Advances in genomic research have enabled use of precision medicine in clinical management of breast cancer. A critical unmet medical need is distinguishing triple negative breast cancer, the most aggressive and lethal form of breast cancer, from non-triple negative breast cancer. Here we propose use of a machine learning (ML) approach for classification of triple negative breast cancer and non-triple negative breast cancer patients using gene expression data. Methods: We performed analysis of RNA-Sequence data from 110 triple negative and 992 non-triple negative breast cancer tumor samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas to select the features (genes) used in the development and validation of the classification models. We evaluated four different classification models including Support Vector Machines, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes and Decision tree using features selected at different threshold levels to train the models for classifying the two types of breast cancer. For performance evaluation and validation, the proposed methods were applied to independent gene expression datasets. Results: Among the four ML algorithms evaluated, the Support Vector Machine algorithm was able to classify breast cancer more accurately into triple negative and non-triple negative breast cancer and had less misclassification errors than the other three algorithms evaluated. Conclusions: The prediction results show that ML algorithms are efficient and can be used for classification of breast cancer into triple negative and non-triple negative breast cancer types."
2019,Detection and classification the breast tumors using mask R-CNN on sonograms,"Abstract Breast cancer is one of the most harmful diseases for women with the highest morbidity. An efficient way to decrease its mortality is to diagnose cancer earlier by screening. Clinically, the best approach of screening for Asian women is ultrasound images combined with biopsies. However, biopsy is invasive and it gets incomprehensive information of the lesion. The aim of this study is to build a model for automatic detection, segmentation, and classification of breast lesions with ultrasound images. Based on deep learning, a technique using Mask regions with convolutional neural network was developed for lesion detection and differentiation between benign and malignant. The mean average precision was 0.75 for the detection and segmentation. The overall accuracy of benign/malignant classification was 85%. The proposed method provides a comprehensive and noninvasive way to detect and classify breast lesions."
2015,Knowledge Mining from Clinical Datasets Using Rough Sets and Backpropagation Neural Network,"The availability of clinical datasets and knowledge mining methodologies encourages the researchers to pursue research in extracting knowledge from clinical datasets. Different data mining techniques have been used for mining rules, and mathematical models have been developed to assist the clinician in decision making. The objective of this research is to build a classifier that will predict the presence or absence of a disease by learning from the minimal set of attributes that has been extracted from the clinical dataset. In this work rough set indiscernibility relation method with backpropagation neural network (RS-BPNN) is used. This work has two stages. The first stage is handling of missing values to obtain a smooth data set and selection of appropriate attributes from the clinical dataset by indiscernibility relation method. The second stage is classification using backpropagation neural network on the selected reducts of the dataset. The classifier has been tested with hepatitis, Wisconsin breast cancer, and Statlog heart disease datasets obtained from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository. The accuracy obtained from the proposed method is 97.3%, 98.6%, and 90.4% for hepatitis, breast cancer, and heart disease, respectively. The proposed system provides an effective classification model for clinical datasets."
2017,LightGBM: An Effective miRNA Classification Method in Breast Cancer Patients,"miRNAs are small noncoding RNA molecules, mainly responsible for post-transcriptional control of gene expressions. Machine learning is becoming more and more widely used in breast tumor classification and diagnosis. In this paper, we compared the performance of different machine learning methods, such as Random Forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting(XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LightGBM), for miRNAs identification in breast cancer patients. The performance comparison of each algorithm was evaluated based on the accuracy and logistic loss and where LightGBM was found better performing in several aspects. hsa-mir-139 was found as an important target for the breast cancer classification. As a powerful tool, LightGBM can be used to identify and classify miRNA target in breast cancer."
2014,A new X-ray activated nanoparticle photosensitizer for cancer treatment.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has attracted ever-growing attention as a promising modality in the treatment of cancer. However, due to the poor tissue penetration by light, PDT has rarely been applied for treating deep-seated tumors. This problem can be solved if photosensitizers are activated by X-rays, which are able to penetrate deeply into tissues. Previous attempts using X-rays to activate photosensitizers were not very successful, since the traditional PDT photosensitizers could not efficiently be activated with X-rays. Here we exploit copper-cysteamine complex (Cu-Cy) nanoparticles as a new type of photosensitizer activated by X-ray for cancer treatment. The newly invented Cu-Cy nanoparticles can be activated directly by X-rays to produce singlet oxygen. In vitro and in vivo study on human breast cancer cells (MCF-7) have shown significant cell destruction using Cu-Cy nanoparticles under X-ray activation. The Cu-Cy nanoparticles are a novel and potent X-ray activated photosensitizer which can enable PDT for deep cancer treatment."
2018,Revisiting tumor patterns and penetrance in germline TP53 mutation carriers: temporal phases of Li–Fraumeni syndrome,"Purpose of review Germline pathogenic TP53 mutation may predispose to multiple cancers but penetrance and cancer patterns remain incompletely documented. We have analyzed international agency for research on cancer TP53 database to reevaluate age and variant-dependent tumor patterns. Recent findings Genome-wide studies suggest that germline variants are more frequent than estimated prevalence of Li–Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), suggesting that many carriers of potentially pathogenic mutations may not develop the syndrome. Carriers of a germline TP53 mutation who are detected in a clinical context have a penetrance of 80% at age 70. Penetrance varies according to age, sex and mutation type. Temporal tumor patterns show distinct phases, with childhood phase (0–15 years, 22% of all cancers) characterized by adrenal cortical carcinoma, choroid plexus carcinoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma; early adulthood phase (16–50 years, 51%) including breast cancer, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcomas, leukemia, astrocytoma and glioblastoma, colorectal and lung cancer; late adulthood phase (51–80 years, 27%) including pancreatic and prostate cancer. Summary Germline pathogenic variants in TP53 gene have different consequences according to cell, tissue, context and age. The occurrence of frequent variants in patients with no criteria suggestive of LFS calls for attention in predicting individual risk and highlights the need of additional predictors for assigning carriers to appropriate surveillance programs."
2014,Psychosocial/survivorship issues in breast cancer: are we doing better?,"Modern breast cancer treatment offers many women greater prospects of cure or lengthier, good quality survival than was possible in the past. Advances include improved diagnostic and staging procedures, sophisticated onco-plastic surgery, enhanced radiotherapy techniques, and targeted systemic therapies. Much more attention has also been paid to cancer care delivery and access to specialist nurses, counsellors, support groups, and services provided by breast cancer charities. However, there are some concerns that these considerable improvements in treatment delivery and clinical outcomes have not led to similar benefits in the psychosocial, functional, and sexual well-being of women. The impact that non-life threatening, long-term iatrogenic harms of otherwise efficacious anticancer treatments has on patients is often overlooked; this is in part because of the emphasis given to physician-reported safety data in trials and the general exclusion of patient-reported outcomes (PROs). A failure to utilise reliable PRO measures has meant that some problems are underreported, which consequently has hampered much-needed research into ameliorative interventions. Systematic monitoring of quality of life-threatening side effects would permit early implementation of effective interventions and enhance long-term survivorship. Some examples of the pervasive difficulties that continue to affect survivors and evidence that certain interventions might help are provided in this commentary."
2016,Comparison of Clinicopathological Features and Prognosis in Triple-Negative and Non-Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"Purpose: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its high-risk biological characteristics and lacking of effective treatment method. The purpose of this retrospective study was to find out the incidence of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) in all kinds of breast cancers and to compare and analyze the clinicopathological features, recurrence, metastasis and prognosis of patients with TNBC and non-triple negative breast cancer (non-TNBC). Methods: A total of 1578 female patients with primary breast cancer were diagnosed and treated at the department of General Surgery, the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, from Jan. 2004 to Jun. 2009. The 1578 breast cancer patients were divided into two groups: the TNBC group and the non-TNBC group. The clinical features and prognosis of the two groups were compared. Results: The incidence of TNBC was 20.41%. Compared with the non-TNBC, the TNBC were characterized as younger age, higher histological grade, higher rate of positive lymph node, bigger tumor size, higher clinical stage at diagnosis, higher histological grade, quicker and easier recurrence and metastasis and lower 5-year DFS rate and 5-year OS rate. The metastasis of TNBC had obvious organic tendency. The lungs, liver and brain were the first three most common sites of metastases. The information of age, the tumor size, lymph node status, clinical stage, histological grade, pathological types and operation method, especially the age and lymph node status play the important roles in judging the prognosis of TNBC. Conclusions: According to this study we found that TNBC was a distinct subgroup of breast cancer with particular clinicopathologic behavior. Compared with the non-TNBC, TNBC was characterized by more aggressive behavior, and lower DFS and OS rate. The metastasis of TNBC had obvious organic tendency. The information of age, the maximum diameter of the tumor, lymph node status, clinical stage, histological grade, pathological types and operation method, especially the age and lymph node status played the important roles in judging the prognosis of TNBC patients."
2017,Classification of breast cancer in ultrasound imaging using a generic deep learning analysis software: a pilot study.,"OBJECTIVE To train a generic deep learning software (DLS) to classify breast cancer on ultrasound images and to compare its performance to human readers with variable breast imaging experience. METHODS In this retrospective study, all breast ultrasound examinations from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014 at our institution were reviewed. Patients with post-surgical scars, initially indeterminate, or malignant lesions with histological diagnoses or 2-year follow-up were included. The DLS was trained with 70% of the images, and the remaining 30% were used to validate the performance. Three readers with variable expertise also evaluated the validation set (radiologist, resident, medical student). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed with a receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS 82 patients with malignant and 550 with benign lesions were included. Time needed for training was 7 min (DLS). Evaluation time for the test data set were 3.7 s (DLS) and 28, 22 and 25 min for human readers (decreasing experience). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed non-significant differences (p-values 0.45-0.47) in the area under the curve of 0.84 (DLS), 0.88 (experienced and intermediate readers) and 0.79 (inexperienced reader). CONCLUSION DLS may aid diagnosing cancer on breast ultrasound images with an accuracy comparable to radiologists, and learns better and faster than a human reader with no prior experience. Further clinical trials with dedicated algorithms are warranted. Advances in knowledge: DLS can be trained classify cancer on breast ultrasound images high accuracy even with comparably few training cases. The fast evaluation speed makes real-time image analysis feasible."
2018,Estrogen Receptor-Positive Breast Cancer: Exploiting Signaling Pathways Implicated in Endocrine Resistance.,"Advancements in molecular profiling and endocrine therapy (ET) have led to more focused clinical attention on precision medicine. These advances have expanded our understanding of breast cancer (BC) pathogenesis and hold promising implications for the future of therapy. The estrogen receptor-α is a predominant endocrine regulatory protein in the breast and in estrogen-induced BC. Successful targeting of proteins and genes within estrogen receptor (ER) nuclear and nonnuclear pathways remains a clinical goal. Several classes of antiestrogenic agents are available for patients with early, advanced, or metastatic BC, including selective ER modulators, aromatase inhibitors, and a selective ER degrader. Clinical development is focused upon characterizing the efficacy and tolerability of inhibitors that target the phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/akt murine thymoma viral oncogene (AKT)/mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor (mTOR) signaling pathway or the cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) cell cycle pathway in women with hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative BC who have demonstrated disease recurrence or progression. De novo and acquired resistance remain a major challenge for women with BC receiving antiestrogenic therapy. Therefore, sequential combination of targeted ET is preferred in these patients, and the ever-increasing understanding of resistance mechanisms may better inform the selection of future therapy. This review describes the intricate roles of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and CDK4/6 pathways in intracellular signaling and the use of endocrine and endocrine-based combination therapy in BC. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE The foundational strategy for treating hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth receptor 2-negative, advanced breast cancer includes the use of endocrine therapy either alone or in combination with targeted agents. The use of combination therapy aims to downregulate cell-signaling pathways with the intent of minimizing cellular ""crosstalk,"" which can otherwise result in continued tumorigenesis or progression through redundant pathways. This review provides the clinician with the molecular rationale and clinical evidence for these treatments and refers to evidence-based guidelines to inform the decision-making process."
2022,Breast cancer detection based on thermographic images using machine learning and deep learning algorithms,"According to the latest data, breast carcinoma is the most prevalent kind of cancer in the world, and it is responsible for the deaths of almost 900 thousand people each year. If the disease is detected at the early stage and diagnosed properly, it can improve the chance of positive outcomes, thus reducing the fatality rate. An early diagnosis in fact can help in preventing it to spread and saves the premature victims from obtaining it. When trying to distinguish among benign and malignant tumors, as well as when trying to draw conclusions about mild and advanced breast cancer, researchers who study cancer encounter a number of challenges. The identification of all tumors is accomplished through the application of machine learning, which makes use of algorithms that are able to locate and recognize patterns. All of them, however, revolve around the concept of ""binary grouping,"" as was mentioned earlier (malignant and benign; no-cancer and cancer). In this study, we propose a Computer-aided Diagnosis (CAD) method for the identification and diagnosis of patients into 3 classes (cancer, no cancer, and non-cancerous) under the management of a database. CAD is an abbreviation for computer-aided diagnosis. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest are all remarkable classifiers (RF). Convolution Networks, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest are the three effective classifiers that we look into and analyses for the classification stage (RF). In addition to this, we investigate the impact of the mammography pictures being pre-processed in advance, which allows for a higher success rate in categorization."
2018,Cancer-Related Cognitive Outcomes Among Older Breast Cancer Survivors in the Thinking and Living With Cancer Study.,"PURPOSE To determine treatment and aging-related effects on longitudinal cognitive function in older breast cancer survivors. METHODS Newly diagnosed nonmetastatic breast cancer survivors (n = 344) and matched controls without cancer (n = 347) 60 years of age and older without dementia or neurologic disease were recruited between August 2010 and December 2015. Data collection occurred during presystemic treatment/control enrollment and at 12 and 24 months through biospecimens; surveys; self-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Cognitive Function; and neuropsychological tests that measured attention, processing speed, and executive function (APE) and learning and memory (LM). Linear mixed-effects models tested two-way interactions of treatment group (control, chemotherapy with or without hormonal therapy, and hormonal therapy) and time and explored three-way interactions of ApoE (ε4+ v not) by group by time; covariates included baseline age, frailty, race, and cognitive reserve. RESULTS Survivors and controls were 60 to 98 years of age, were well educated, and had similar baseline cognitive scores. Treatment was related to longitudinal cognition scores, with survivors who received chemotherapy having increasingly worse APE scores ( P = .05) and those initiating hormonal therapy having lower LM scores at 12 months ( P = .03) than other groups. These group-by-time differences varied by ApoE genotype, where only ε4+ survivors receiving hormone therapy had short-term decreases in adjusted LM scores (three-way interaction P = .03). For APE, the three-way interaction was not significant ( P = .14), but scores were significantly lower for ε4+ survivors exposed to chemotherapy (-0.40; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.01) at 24 months than ε4+ controls (0.01; 95% CI, 0.16 to 0.18; P < .05). Increasing age was associated with lower baseline scores on all cognitive measures ( P < .001); frailty was associated with baseline APE and self-reported decline ( P < .001). CONCLUSION Breast cancer systemic treatment and aging-related phenotypes and genotypes are associated with longitudinal decreases in cognitive function scores in older survivors. These data could inform treatment decision making and survivorship care planning."
2022,Piezotronic Effect-Augmented Cu2-xO-BaTiO3 Sonosensitizers for Multifunctional Cancer Dynamic Therapy.,"Ultrasound (US)-triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT) based on semiconductor nanomaterials has attracted considerable attention for cancer therapy. However, most inorganic sonosensitizers suffer from low efficiency due to the rapid recombination of electron-hole pairs. Herein, the Cu2-xO-BaTiO3 piezoelectric heterostructure was fabricated as a sonosensitizer and chemodynamic agent, simultaneously, for improving reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and cancer therapeutic outcome. Under US irradiation, the Cu2-xO-BaTiO3 heterojunction with a piezotronic effect exhibits high-performance singlet oxygen (1O2) and hydroxyl radical (•OH) generation to enhance SDT. Moreover, it possesses Fenton-like reaction activity to convert endogenous H2O2 into •OH for chemodynamic therapy (CDT). The integration of SDT and CDT substantially boosts ROS generation and cellular mitochondria damage, and the in vitro and in vivo results demonstrate high cytotoxicity and tumor inhibition on murine refractory breast cancer. This work realizes improvement in cancer therapy using piezoelectric heterostructures with piezotronic effects."
2020,Optimizing the Performance of Breast Cancer Classification by Employing the Same Domain Transfer Learning from Hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model,"Breast cancer is a significant factor in female mortality. An early cancer diagnosis leads to a reduction in the breast cancer death rate. With the help of a computer-aided diagnosis system, the efficiency increased, and the cost was reduced for the cancer diagnosis. Traditional breast cancer classification techniques are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies upon the chosen features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes and complex shapes. However, histopathological breast cancer images are very complex in shape. Currently, deep learning models have become an alternative solution for diagnosis, and have overcome the drawbacks of classical classification techniques. Although deep learning has performed well in various tasks of computer vision and pattern recognition, it still has some challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of training data. To address this challenge and optimize the performance, we have utilized a transfer learning technique which is where the deep learning models train on a task, and then fine-tune the models for another task. We have employed transfer learning in two ways: Training our proposed model first on the same domain dataset, then on the target dataset, and training our model on a different domain dataset, then on the target dataset. We have empirically proven that the same domain transfer learning optimized the performance. Our hybrid model of parallel convolutional layers and residual links is utilized to classify hematoxylin–eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes: invasive carcinoma, in-situ carcinoma, benign tumor and normal tissue. To reduce the effect of overfitting, we have augmented the images with different image processing techniques. The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance, and it outperformed the latest methods by achieving a patch-wise classification accuracy of 90.5%, and an image-wise classification accuracy of 97.4% on the validation set. Moreover, we have achieved an image-wise classification accuracy of 96.1% on the test set of the microscopy ICIAR-2018 dataset."
2021,Cloud Computing-Based Framework for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Extreme Learning Machine,"Globally, breast cancer is one of the most significant causes of death among women. Early detection accompanied by prompt treatment can reduce the risk of death due to breast cancer. Currently, machine learning in cloud computing plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis, but predominantly among the people living in remote areas where medical facilities are scarce. Diagnosis systems based on machine learning act as secondary readers and assist radiologists in the proper diagnosis of diseases, whereas cloud-based systems can support telehealth services and remote diagnostics. Techniques based on artificial neural networks (ANN) have attracted many researchers to explore their capability for disease diagnosis. Extreme learning machine (ELM) is one of the variants of ANN that has a huge potential for solving various classification problems. The framework proposed in this paper amalgamates three research domains: Firstly, ELM is applied for the diagnosis of breast cancer. Secondly, to eliminate insignificant features, the gain ratio feature selection method is employed. Lastly, a cloud computing-based system for remote diagnosis of breast cancer using ELM is proposed. The performance of the cloud-based ELM is compared with some state-of-the-art technologies for disease diagnosis. The results achieved on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WBCD) dataset indicate that the cloud-based ELM technique outperforms other results. The best performance results of ELM were found for both the standalone and cloud environments, which were compared. The important findings of the experimental results indicate that the accuracy achieved is 0.9868, the recall is 0.9130, the precision is 0.9054, and the F1-score is 0.8129."
2020,"Prediction of Breast Cancer, Comparative Review of Machine Learning Techniques, and Their Analysis","Breast cancer is type of tumor that occurs in the tissues of the breast. It is most common type of cancer found in women around the world and it is among the leading causes of deaths in women. This article presents the comparative analysis of machine learning, deep learning and data mining techniques being used for the prediction of breast cancer. Many researchers have put their efforts on breast cancer diagnoses and prognoses, every technique has different accuracy rate and it varies for different situations, tools and datasets being used. Our main focus is to comparatively analyze different existing Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques in order to find out the most appropriate method that will support the large dataset with good accuracy of prediction. The main purpose of this review is to highlight all the previous studies of machine learning algorithms that are being used for breast cancer prediction and this article provides the all necessary information to the beginners who want to analyze the machine learning algorithms to gain the base of deep learning."
2020,Breast Tumor Classification Using an Ensemble Machine Learning Method,"Breast cancer is the most common cause of death for women worldwide. Thus, the ability of artificial intelligence systems to detect possible breast cancer is very important. In this paper, an ensemble classification mechanism is proposed based on a majority voting mechanism. First, the performance of different state-of-the-art machine learning classification algorithms were evaluated for the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD). The three best classifiers were then selected based on their F3 score. F3 score is used to emphasize the importance of false negatives (recall) in breast cancer classification. Then, these three classifiers, simple logistic regression learning, support vector machine learning with stochastic gradient descent optimization and multilayer perceptron network, are used for ensemble classification using a voting mechanism. We also evaluated the performance of hard and soft voting mechanism. For hard voting, majority-based voting mechanism was used and for soft voting we used average of probabilities, product of probabilities, maximum of probabilities and minimum of probabilities-based voting methods. The hard voting (majority-based voting) mechanism shows better performance with 99.42%, as compared to the state-of-the-art algorithm for WBCD."
2020,Characterization of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer MDA-MB-231 Cell Spheroid Model,"Background The tumor three-dimensional (3D) spheroid model in vitro is effective on detecting malignant cells and tumorigenesis, and assessing drug resistance. Compared with two-dimensional (2D) monolayer culture, breast cancer (BC) spheroids more accurately reﬂect the complex microenvironment in vivo, which have been extensively reported in BC research. MDA-MB-231 cells, the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line, display representative epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated with BC metastasis. However, the characterization of MDA-MB-231 spheroids has been largely unknown at present, which requires further attention. Materials and Methods Microwell array was conducted for the formation of MDA-MB-231 spheroids. In addition, H&E staining, immunohistochemistry (IHC), CellTiter-Glo® 3D cell viability assay, and flow cytometry were performed to investigate the structure and growth characteristics. Besides, Transwell and scratch healing assays were carried out to detect the migratory capacities compared with 2D culture. Western blotting and confocal fluorescence were selected to detect the expression of EMT-associated proteins. Additionally, the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of antitumor compounds Carboplatin and Doxorubicin were measured to assess drug resistance. Results The MDA-MB-231 spheroids were viable, which maintained a compact structure with zonation features for up to 9 days. Moreover, those spheroids had a slower growth rate than those cultured as a monolayer and differential zones of proliferation. The migratory capacities were significantly enhanced by transferring the spheroids to 2D adherent culture. Compared with 2D culture, the levels of EMT-associated proteins were significantly up-regulated in spheroids. Furthermore, toxicity assessment showed that spheroids exhibited an increased resistance to the antitumor compounds. Conclusion This study develops the simple spheroids and demonstrates their structure, growth and proliferation characteristics. According to our results, the spheroids are associated with superior EMT and high resistance to toxicological response compared with the standard 2D monocultures."
2019,The Cytotoxicity Effect of Resveratrol: Cell Cycle Arrest and Induced Apoptosis of Breast Cancer 4T1 Cells,"Resveratrol, a natural polyterpenoid, can scavenge reactive oxygen species in vivo to carry out the functions of antioxidation and antiaging. Resveratrol’s anti-cancer capability has attracted widespread attention, but its molecular mechanism has not been systematically explained. In this study, by comparing the activity of normal cell lines and cancer cell lines after treating with resveratrol, it was found that resveratrol has more significant cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines. Resveratrol could play a toxic role through inducing apoptosis of the cancer cell in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. A total of 330 significantly differential genes were identified through large-scale transcriptome sequencing, among which 103 genes were upregulated and 227 genes were downregulated. Transcriptome and qRT-PCR data proved that a large number of genes related to cell cycle were differentially expressed after the treatment of resveratrol. The changes of cell cycle phases at different time points after treating with resveratrol were further detected, and it was found that the cells were arrested in the S phase because of the percentage of cells in S phase increased and cells in G1/G0 phase decreased. In conclusion, resveratrol can inhibit the proliferation of 4T1 cancer cells by inhibiting cell cycle and inducing apoptosis."
2021,Transfer Learning in Breast Cancer Diagnoses via Ultrasound Imaging,"Simple Summary Transfer learning plays a major role in medical image analyses; however, obtaining adequate training image datasets for machine learning algorithms can be challenging. Although many studies have attempted to employ transfer learning in medical image analyses, thus far, only a few review articles regarding the application of transfer learning to medical image analyses have been published. Moreover, reviews on the application of transfer learning in ultrasound breast imaging are rare. This work reviews previous studies that focused on detecting breast cancer from ultrasound images by using transfer learning, in order to summarize existing methods and identify their advantages and shortcomings. Additionally, this review presents potential future research directions for applying transfer learning in ultrasound imaging for the purposes of breast cancer detection and diagnoses. This review is expected to be significantly helpful in guiding researchers to identify potential improved methods and areas that can be improved through further research on transfer learning-based ultrasound breast imaging. Abstract Transfer learning is a machine learning approach that reuses a learning method developed for a task as the starting point for a model on a target task. The goal of transfer learning is to improve performance of target learners by transferring the knowledge contained in other (but related) source domains. As a result, the need for large numbers of target-domain data is lowered for constructing target learners. Due to this immense property, transfer learning techniques are frequently used in ultrasound breast cancer image analyses. In this review, we focus on transfer learning methods applied on ultrasound breast image classification and detection from the perspective of transfer learning approaches, pre-processing, pre-training models, and convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Finally, comparison of different works is carried out, and challenges—as well as outlooks—are discussed."
2019,Weakly supervised 3D deep learning for breast cancer classification and localization of the lesions in MR images,The usefulness of 3D deep learning‐based classification of breast cancer and malignancy localization from MRI has been reported. This work can potentially be very useful in the clinical domain and aid radiologists in breast cancer diagnosis.
2020,Guided Soft Attention Network for Classification of Breast Cancer Histopathology Images,"An attention guided convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of breast cancer histopathology images is proposed. Neural networks are generally applied as black box models and often the network’s decisions are difficult to interpret. Making the decision process transparent, and hence reliable is important for a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system. Moreover, it is crucial that the network’s decision be based on histopathological features that are in agreement with a human expert. To this end, we propose to use additional region-level supervision for the classification of breast cancer histopathology images using CNN, where the regions of interest (RoI) are localized and used to guide the attention of the classification network simultaneously. The proposed supervised attention mechanism specifically activates neurons in diagnostically relevant regions while suppressing activations in irrelevant and noisy areas. The class activation maps generated by the proposed method correlate well with the expectations of an expert pathologist. Moreover, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art on the BACH microscopy test dataset (part A) with a significant margin."
2018,Simultaneous cancer and tumor microenvironment subtyping using confocal infrared microscopy for all-digital molecular histopathology,"Significance Cancer alters both the morphological and the biochemical properties of multiple cell types in a tissue. Generally, the morphology of epithelial cells is practical for routine disease diagnoses. Here, infrared spectroscopic imaging biochemically characterizes breast cancer, both epithelial cells and the tumor-associated microenvironment. Unfortunately, conventional spectral analyses are slow. Hence, we designed and built a laser confocal microscope that demonstrates a high signal-to-noise ratio for confident diagnoses. The instrument cuts down imaging time from days to minutes, making the technology feasible for research and clinical translation. Finally, automated human breast cancer biopsy imaging is reported in ∼1 hour, paving the way for routine research into the total tumor (epithelial plus microenvironment) properties and rapid, label-free diagnoses. Histopathology based on spatial patterns of epithelial cells is the gold standard for clinical diagnoses and research in carcinomas; although known to be important, the tissue microenvironment is not readily used due to complex and subjective interpretation with existing tools. Here, we demonstrate accurate subtyping from molecular properties of epithelial cells using emerging high-definition Fourier transform infrared (HD FT-IR) spectroscopic imaging combined with machine learning algorithms. In addition to detecting four epithelial subtypes, we simultaneously delineate three stromal subtypes that characterize breast tumors. While FT-IR imaging data enable fully digital pathology with rich information content, the long spectral scanning times required for signal averaging and processing make the technology impractical for routine research or clinical use. Hence, we developed a confocal design in which refractive IR optics are designed to provide high-definition, rapid spatial scanning and discrete spectral tuning using a quantum cascade laser (QCL) source. This instrument provides simultaneously high resolving power (2-μm pixel size) and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) (>1,300), providing a speed increase of ∼50-fold for obtaining classified results compared with present imaging spectrometers. We demonstrate spectral fidelity and interinstrument operability of our developed instrument by accurate analysis of a 100-case breast tissue set that was analyzed in a day, considerably speeding research. Clinical breast biopsies typical of a patients’ caseload are analyzed in ∼1 hour. This study paves the way for comprehensive tumor-microenvironment analyses in feasible time periods, presenting a critical step in practical label-free molecular histopathology."
2017,Artificial Neural Networks in Image Processing for Early Detection of Breast Cancer,"Medical imaging techniques have widely been in use in the diagnosis and detection of breast cancer. The drawback of applying these techniques is the large time consumption in the manual diagnosis of each image pattern by a professional radiologist. Automated classifiers could substantially upgrade the diagnosis process, in terms of both accuracy and time requirement by distinguishing benign and malignant patterns automatically. Neural network (NN) plays an important role in this respect, especially in the application of breast cancer detection. Despite the large number of publications that describe the utilization of NN in various medical techniques, only a few reviews are available that guide the development of these algorithms to enhance the detection techniques with respect to specificity and sensitivity. The purpose of this review is to analyze the contents of recently published literature with special attention to techniques and states of the art of NN in medical imaging. We discuss the usage of NN in four different medical imaging applications to show that NN is not restricted to few areas of medicine. Types of NN used, along with the various types of feeding data, have been reviewed. We also address hybrid NN adaptation in breast cancer detection."

2017,HER2 challenge contest: a detailed assessment of automated HER2 scoring algorithms in whole slide images of breast cancer tissues,"Evaluating expression of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) by visual examination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) on invasive breast cancer (BCa) is a key part of the diagnostic assessment of BCa due to its recognized importance as a predictive and prognostic marker in clinical practice. However, visual scoring of HER2 is subjective, and consequently prone to interobserver variability. Given the prognostic and therapeutic implications of HER2 scoring, a more objective method is required. In this paper, we report on a recent automated HER2 scoring contest, held in conjunction with the annual PathSoc meeting held in Nottingham in June 2016, aimed at systematically comparing and advancing the state‐of‐the‐art artificial intelligence (AI)‐based automated methods for HER2 scoring."
2015,Green Tea and Anticancer Perspectives: Updates from Last Decade,"Green tea is the most widely consumed beverage besides water and has attained significant attention owing to health benefits against array of maladies, e.g., obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer insurgence. The major bioactive molecules are epigallocatechin-3-gallate, epicatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin, etc. The anticarcinogenic and antimutagenic activities of green tea were highlighted some years ago. Several cohort studies and controlled randomized trials suggested the inverse association of green tea consumption and cancer prevalence. Cell culture and animal studies depicted the mechanisms of green tea to control cancer insurgence, i.e., induction of apoptosis to control cell growth arrest, altered expression of cell-cycle regulatory proteins, activation of killer caspases, and suppression of nuclear factor kappa-B activation. It acts as carcinoma blocker by modulating the signal transduction pathways involved in cell proliferation, transformation, inflammation, and metastasis. However, results generated from some research interventions conducted in different groups like smokers and nonsmokers, etc. contradicted with aforementioned anticancer perspectives. In this review paper, anticancer perspectives of green tea and its components have been described. Recent findings and literature have been surfed and arguments are presented to clarify the ambiguities regarding anticancer perspectives of green tea and its component especially against colon, skin, lung, prostate, and breast cancer.

2014,All-in-one centrifugal microfluidic device for size-selective circulating tumor cell isolation with high purity.,"Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have gained increasing attention owing to their roles in cancer recurrence and progression. Due to the rarity of CTCs in the bloodstream, an enrichment process is essential for effective target cell characterization. However, in a typical pressure-driven microfluidic system, the enrichment process generally requires complicated equipment and long processing times. Furthermore, the commonly used immunoaffinity-based positive selection method is limited, as its recovery rate relies on EpCAM expression of target CTCs, which shows heterogeneity among cell types. Here, we propose a centrifugal-force-based size-selective CTC isolation platform that can isolate and enumerate CTCs from whole blood within 30 s with high purity. The device was validated using the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line spiked in phosphate-buffered saline and whole blood, and an average capture efficiency of 61% was achieved, which is typical for size-based filtration. The capture efficiency for whole blood samples varied from 44% to 84% under various flow conditions and dilution factors. Under the optimized operating conditions, a few hundred white blood cells per 1 mL of whole blood were captured, representing a 20-fold decrease compared to those obtained using a commercialized size-based CTC isolation device. In clinical validation, normalized CTC counts varied from 10 to 60 per 7.5 mL of blood from gastric and lung cancer patients, yielding a detection rate of 50% and 38%, respectively. Overall, our CTC isolation device enables rapid and label-free isolation of CTCs with high purity, which should greatly improve downstream molecular analyses of captured CTCs."
2019,CAD and AI for breast cancer - Recent Development and Challenges.,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been a popular area of research and development in the past few decades. In CAD, machine learning methods and multidisciplinary knowledge and techniques are used to analyze the patient information and the results can be used to assist clinicians in their decision making process. CAD may analyze imaging information alone or in combination with other clinical data. It may provide the analyzed information directly to the clinician or correlate the analyzed results with the likelihood of certain diseases based on statistical modeling of the past cases in the population. CAD systems can be developed to provide decision support for many applications in the patient care processes, such as lesion detection, characterization, cancer staging, treatment planning and response assessment, recurrence and prognosis prediction. The new state-of-the-art machine learning technique, known as deep learning (DL), has revolutionized speech and text recognition as well as computer vision. The potential of major breakthrough by DL in medical image analysis and other CAD applications for patient care has brought about unprecedented excitement of applying CAD, or artificial intelligence (AI), to medicine in general and to radiology in particular. In this paper, we will provide an overview of the recent developments of CAD using DL in breast imaging and discuss some challenges and practical issues that may impact the advancement of AI and its integration into clinical workflow."
2016,Leveraging Social Media to Promote Public Health Knowledge: Example of Cancer Awareness via Twitter,"Background As social media becomes increasingly popular online venues for engaging in communication about public health issues, it is important to understand how users promote knowledge and awareness about specific topics. Objective The aim of this study is to examine the frequency of discussion and differences by race and ethnicity of cancer-related topics among unique users via Twitter. Methods Tweets were collected from April 1, 2014 through January 21, 2015 using the Twitter public streaming Application Programming Interface (API) to collect 1% of public tweets. Twitter users were classified into racial and ethnic groups using a new text mining approach applied to English-only tweets. Each ethnic group was then analyzed for frequency in cancer-related terms within user timelines, investigated for changes over time and across groups, and measured for statistical significance. Results Observable usage patterns of the terms ""cancer"", ""breast cancer"", ""prostate cancer"", and ""lung cancer"" between Caucasian and African American groups were evident across the study period. We observed some variation in the frequency of term usage during months known to be labeled as cancer awareness months, particularly September, October, and November. Interestingly, we found that of the terms studied, ""colorectal cancer"" received the least Twitter attention. Conclusions The findings of the study provide evidence that social media can serve as a very powerful and important tool in implementing and disseminating critical prevention, screening, and treatment messages to the community in real-time. The study also introduced and tested a new methodology of identifying race and ethnicity among users of the social media. Study findings highlight the potential benefits of social media as a tool in reducing racial and ethnic disparities."
2020,The Power of Phytochemicals Combination in Cancer Chemoprevention,"Conventional therapies for cancer treatment have posed many challenges, including toxicity, multidrug resistance and economic expenses. In contrast, complementary alternative medicine (CAM), employing phytochemicals have recently received increased attention owing to their capability to modulate a myriad of molecular mechanisms with a less toxic effect. Increasing evidence from preclinical and clinical studies suggest that phytochemicals can favorably modulate several signaling pathways involved in cancer development and progression. Combinations of phytochemicals promote cell death, inhibit cell proliferation and invasion, sensitize cancerous cells, and boost the immune system, thus making them striking alternatives in cancer therapy. We previously investigated the effect of six phytochemicals (Indol-3-Carbinol, Resveratrol, C-phycocyanin, Isoflavone, Curcumin and Quercetin), at their bioavailable levels on breast cancer cell lines and were compared to primary cell lines over a period of 6 days. This study showed the compounds had a synergestic effect in inhibiting cell proliferation, reducing cellular migration and invasion, inducing both cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Despite the vast number of basic science and preclinical cancer studies involving phytochemicals, the number of CAM clinical trials in cancer treatment still remains nascent. In this review, we summarize findings from preclinical and clinical studies, including our work involving use of phytochemicals, individually as well as in combination and further discuss the potential of these phytochemicals to pave way to integrate CAM in primary health care."
2018,AUNet: attention-guided dense-upsampling networks for breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms,"Mammography is one of the most commonly applied tools for early breast cancer screening. Automatic segmentation of breast masses in mammograms is essential but challenging due to the low signal-to-noise ratio and the wide variety of mass shapes and sizes. Existing methods deal with these challenges mainly by extracting mass-centered image patches manually or automatically. However, manual patch extraction is time-consuming and automatic patch extraction brings errors that could not be compensated in the following segmentation step. In this study, we propose a novel attention-guided dense-upsampling network (AUNet) for accurate breast mass segmentation in whole mammograms directly. In AUNet, we employ an asymmetrical encoder–decoder structure and propose an effective upsampling block, attention-guided dense-upsampling block (AU block). Especially, the AU block is designed to have three merits. Firstly, it compensates the information loss of bilinear upsampling by dense upsampling. Secondly, it designs a more effective method to fuse high- and low-level features. Thirdly, it includes a channel-attention function to highlight rich-information channels. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly available datasets, CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. Compared to three state-of-the-art fully convolutional networks, AUNet achieved the best performances with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 81.8% for CBIS-DDSM and 79.1% for INbreast."
2014,Gynecomastia: Clinical evaluation and management,"Gynecomastia is the benign enlargement of male breast glandular tissue and is the most common breast condition in males. At least 30% of males will be affected during their life. Since it causes anxiety, psychosocial discomfort and fear of breast cancer, early diagnostic evaluation is important and patients usually seek medical attention. Gynecomastia was reported to cause an imbalance between estrogen and androgen action or an increased estrogen to androgen ratio, due to increased estrogen production, decreased androgen production or both. Evaluation of gynecomastia must include a detailed medical history, clinical examination, specific blood tests, imaging and tissue sampling. Individual treatment requirements can range from simple reassurance to medical treatment or even surgery. The main aim of any intervention is to relieve the symptoms and exclude other etiological factors."
2019,"Combating breast cancer using combination therapy with 3 phytochemicals: Piperine, sulforaphane, and thymoquinone","Despite the significant advances in screening methods for early diagnosis, breast cancer remains a global threat and continues to be the leading cancer diagnosed in women, requiring effective therapy. Currently, combination therapy has become the hallmark of breast cancer treatment due to the high incidence of tumor recurrence and disease progression after monotherapeutic treatments, including surgery, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy, and chemotherapy. Over the past decades, there has been considerable interest in studying the anticancer effect of bioactive phytochemicals from medicinal plants combined with these conventional therapies. The rationale for this type of therapy is to use combinations of drugs that work by different mechanisms, thereby decreasing the likelihood that cancer cells will develop resistance, and also reduce the therapeutic dose and toxicity of single treatments. Three agents have received great attention with regard to their anticancer properties: 1) piperine, a dietary phytochemical isolated from black pepper (Piper nigrum L.) and long pepper (Piper longum L.); 2) sulforaphane, an isothiocyanate mainly derived from cruciferous vegetables; and 3) thymoquinone, the active compound from black seed (Nigella sativa L.). This review focused on the combined effect of these 3 compounds on conventional cancer therapy with the objective of observing enhanced efficacy compared with single treatments. This review also highlights the importance of the nanoformulation of such bioactive phytochemicals that could enhance their bioavailability by providing an efficient targeted delivery system with a reduced systemic dose while resulting in a more efficient dosing at the target site."
2017,Deep learning model based breast cancer histopathological image classification,"The automatic and precision classification for breast cancer histopathological image has a great significance in clinical application. However, the existing analysis approaches are difficult to addressing the breast cancer classification problem because the feature subtle differences of inter-class histopathological image and the classification accuracy still hard to meet the clinical application. Recent advancements in data-driven sharing processing and multi-level hierarchical feature learning have made available considerable chance to dope out a solution to this problem. To address the challenging problem, we propose a novel breast cancer histopathological image classification method based on deep convolutional neural networks, named as BiCNN model, to address the two-class breast cancer classification on the pathological image. This deep learning model considers class and sub-class labels of breast cancer as prior knowledge, which can restrain the distance of features of different breast cancer pathological images. In addition, an advanced data augmented method is proposed to fit tolerance whole slide image recognition, which can full reserve image edge feature of cancerization region. The transfer learning and fine-tuning method are adopted as an optimal training strategy to improve breast cancer histopathological image classification accuracy. The experiment results show that the proposed method leads to a higher classification accuracy (up to 97%) and displays good robustness and generalization, which provides efficient tools for breast cancer clinical diagnosis."
2020,Channel Attention Module With Multiscale Grid Average Pooling for Breast Cancer Segmentation in an Ultrasound Image,"Breast cancer accounts for the second-largest number of deaths in women around the world, and more than 8% of women will suffer from the disease in their lifetime. Mortality due to breast cancer can be reduced by its early and precise diagnosis. Many studies have investigated methods for segmentation, and computer-aided diagnosis based on deep learning techniques, in particular, has recently gained attention. However, recently proposed methods such as fully convolutional network (FCN), SegNet, and U-Net still need to be further improved to provide better semantic segmentation when diagnosing breast cancer by ultrasound imaging, because of their low performance. In this article, we propose a channel attention module with multiscale grid average pooling (MSGRAP) for the precise segmentation of breast cancer regions in ultrasound images. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the channel attention module with MSGRAP for semantic segmentation and develop a novel semantic segmentation network with the proposed attention module for the precise segmentation of breast cancer regions in ultrasound images. While a conventional convolutional operation cannot use global spatial information on input images and only use the small local information in a kernel of a convolution filter, the proposed attention module allows using both global and local spatial information. In addition, through ablation studies, we come up with a network architecture for precise breast cancer segmentation in an ultrasound image. The proposed network was constructed with an open-source breast cancer ultrasound image data set, and its performance was compared with those of other state-of-the-art deep-learning models for the segmentation of breast cancer. The experimental results showed that our network outperformed other segmentation methods, and the proposed channel attention module improved the performance of the network for breast cancer segmentation in ultrasound images."
2016,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancers,"With advances in science and technology, there are more innovations in the approach to management of patients with breast cancer. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy that is designed to be used prior to surgical removal of a tumor has received significant attention. Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy is offered to patients with locally advanced breast cancer and also those breast cancer patients who may benefit from size reduction before conservation therapy. There is now sufficient evidence that if neoadjuvant chemotherapy leads to complete pathologic response, the patient will enjoy a better outcome. Therefore, assessment of the degree of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy has a major impact on patient selection and the follow-up management of each patient and defines patient outcome."
2021,Boosting Breast Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Network,"Breast cancer forms in breast cells and is considered as a very common type of cancer in women. Breast cancer is also a very life-threatening disease of women after lung cancer. A convolutional neural network (CNN) method is proposed in this study to boost the automatic identification of breast cancer by analyzing hostile ductal carcinoma tissue zones in whole-slide images (WSIs). The paper investigates the proposed system that uses various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to automatically detect breast cancer, comparing the results with those from machine learning (ML) algorithms. All architectures were guided by a big dataset of about 275,000, 50 × 50-pixel RGB image patches. Validation tests were done for quantitative results using the performance measures for every methodology. The proposed system is found to be successful, achieving results with 87% accuracy, which could reduce human mistakes in the diagnosis process. Moreover, our proposed system achieves accuracy higher than the 78% accuracy of machine learning (ML) algorithms. The proposed system therefore improves accuracy by 9% above results from machine learning (ML) algorithms."
2018,Performance Evaluation of Machine Learning Methods for Breast Cancer Prediction,"Breast cancer is the most common invasive cancer in women and the second main cause of cancer death in females, which can be classified Benign or Malignant. Research and prevention on breast cancer have attracted more concern of researchers in recent years. On the other hand, the development of data mining methods provides an effective way to extract more useful information from complex database, and some prediction, classification and clustering can be made according to extracted information. In this study, to explore the relationship between breast cancer and some attributes so that the death probability of breast cancer can be reduced, five different classification models including Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Neural Network (NN) and Logistics Regression (LR) are used for the classification of two different datasets related to breast cancer: Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) and Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database (WBCD). Three indicators including prediction accuracy values, F-measure metric and AUC values are used to compare the performance of these five classification models. comparative experiment analysis shows that random forest model can achieve better performance and adaptation than other four methods. Therefore, the model of this study is approved to possess clinical and referential values in practical applications."
2019,Biological Effect of Soy Isoflavones in the Prevention of Civilization Diseases,"Scientific advancements in recent years have shed new light on the relationship between diet and human health. Nutrients play an important role in the prevention of many civilization diseases, such as osteoporosis, type II diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, and cardiovascular diseases. The biological activity of natural plant components allows their use in the treatment of various diseases, especially civilization diseases, to be speculated. Special attention is paid to phenolic compounds that have numerous health-promoting properties. Isoflavones, phenolic compounds, are commonly found in legumes, especially in soybeans. Their structural similarity to 17-β-estradiol (E2), the main female sex hormone, allows them to induce estrogenic and antiestrogenic effects by binding to estrogen receptors, and their consumption has been associated with a decreased risk of hormone-related cancers. In addition, numerous epidemiological studies and related meta-analyses suggest that soy consumption may be associated with a lower incidence of certain diseases. However, there are some doubts about the potential effects on health, such as the effectiveness of cardiovascular risk reduction or breast cancer-promoting properties. The purpose of this review is to present the current knowledge on the potential effects of soy isoflavone consumption with regard to civilization diseases."
2014,Chemobrain Experienced by Breast Cancer Survivors: A Meta-Ethnography Study Investigating Research and Care Implications,"Background Cognitive impairment, colloquially termed “chemobrain”, occurs in 10–40% of all cancer patients, and is an emerging target of cancer survivorship research. Aim This study reviews published qualitative studies to explore cognitive impairments or chemobrain among breast cancer survivors, with particular attention given to the impact on quality of life. Method Using keywords, we searched ten electronic databases (CINAHL, EMBASE, Proquest, OVID SP, MEDLINE, Oxford Journal, Science Direct, PubMED). Findings Of 457 papers, seven relevant papers were included. Data was extracted and concepts were analysed using a meta ethnography approach. Four second order intepretations were identified, on the basis of which, four third order intrepretations were constructed. Linked together in a line of argument, was a consistent account on their struggles to self-manage the chemobrain impairments that impact their daily lives. Five concepts emerged from the analysis of the primary findings: i) real experiences of cognitive changes, ii) calls for help, iii) impact of cognitive impairments, iv) coping and v) survivorship and meaning. Further synthesis resulted in four new order intepretations: i) The chemobrain struggle, ii) The substantial impact of chemobrain on life domains, iii) The struggle to readjust and to self manage, and iv) ‘thankful yet fearful’ representation. Discussion Awareness of cognitive changes were context-dependent on healthcare settings and cultural contexts as strong determinants. Subjects verified the existence of chemobrain but healthcare providers mis-recognised, under-recognised, and sometimes negated it perhaps due to its unknown aetiology. Asian breast cancer survivors appear less vocal than their western counterparts. Conclusion The current literature on the lived experiences of how women experienced chemobrain provides a consistent report that chemobrain is real, persistent and with detrimental impacts on quality of life - manifested as a constant struggles. A greater awareness of the effects of chemobrain with improved functional assessment and interventions is warranted."
2019,Variational Autoencoders for Cancer Data Integration: Design Principles and Computational Practice,"International initiatives such as the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) are collecting multiple data sets at different genome-scales with the aim to identify novel cancer bio-markers and predict patient survival. To analyse such data, several machine learning, bioinformatics and statistical methods have been applied, among them neural networks such as autoencoders. Although these models provide a good statistical learning framework to analyse multi-omic and/or clinical data, there is a distinct lack of work on how to integrate diverse patient data and identify the optimal design best suited to the available data. In this paper, we investigate several autoencoder architectures that integrate a variety of cancer patient data types (e.g., multi-omics and clinical data). We perform extensive analyses of these approaches and provide a clear methodological and computational framework for designing systems that enable clinicians to investigate cancer traits and translate the results into clinical applications. We demonstrate how these networks can be designed, built and, in particular, applied to tasks of integrative analyses of heterogeneous breast cancer data. The results show that these approaches yield relevant data representations that, in turn, lead to accurate and stable diagnosis."
2019,Classification of Breast Cancer Histology Images Using Multi-Size and Discriminative Patches Based on Deep Learning,"The diagnosis of breast cancer histology images with hematoxylin and eosin stained is non-trivial, labor-intensive and often leads to a disagreement between pathologists. Computer-assisted diagnosis systems contribute to help pathologists improve diagnostic consistency and efficiency. With the recent advances in deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been successfully used for histology images analysis. The classification of breast cancer histology images into normal, benign, and malignant sub-classes is related to cells’ density, variability, and organization along with overall tissue structure and morphology. Based on this, we extract both smaller and larger size patches from histology images, including cell-level and tissue-level features, respectively. However, there are some sampled cell-level patches that do not contain enough information that matches the image tag. Therefore, we propose a patches’ screening method based on the clustering algorithm and CNN to select more discriminative patches. The approach proposed in this paper is applied to the 4-class classification of breast cancer histology images and achieves 95% accuracy on the initial test set and 88.89% accuracy on the overall test set. The results are competitive compared to the results of other state-of-the-art methods."
2021,Breast Cancer Classification From Histopathological Images Using Patch-Based Deep Learning Modeling,"Accurate detection and classification of breast cancer is a critical task in medical imaging due to the complexity of breast tissues. Due to automatic feature extraction ability, deep learning methods have been successfully applied in different areas, especially in the field of medical imaging. In this study, a novel patch-based deep learning method called Pa-DBN-BC is proposed to detect and classify breast cancer on histopathology images using the Deep Belief Network (DBN). Features are extracted through an unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning phase. The network automatically extracts features from image patches. Logistic regression is used to classify the patches from histopathology images. The features extracted from the patches are fed to the model as input and the model presents the result as a probability matrix as either a positive sample (cancer) or a negative sample (background). The proposed model is trained and tested on the whole slide histopathology image dataset having images from four different data cohorts and achieved an accuracy of 86%. Consequently, the proposed method is better than the traditional ones, as it automatically learns the best possible features and experimental results show that the model outperformed the previously proposed deep learning methods."
2017,Involvement of Machine Learning for Breast Cancer Image Classification: A Survey,"Breast cancer is one of the largest causes of women's death in the world today. Advance engineering of natural image classification techniques and Artificial Intelligence methods has largely been used for the breast-image classification task. The involvement of digital image classification allows the doctor and the physicians a second opinion, and it saves the doctors' and physicians' time. Despite the various publications on breast image classification, very few review papers are available which provide a detailed description of breast cancer image classification techniques, feature extraction and selection procedures, classification measuring parameterizations, and image classification findings. We have put a special emphasis on the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method for breast image classification. Along with the CNN method we have also described the involvement of the conventional Neural Network (NN), Logic Based classifiers such as the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Bayesian methods, and a few of the semisupervised and unsupervised methods which have been used for breast image classification."
2016,Text Mining Genotype-Phenotype Relationships from Biomedical Literature for Database Curation and Precision Medicine,"The practice of precision medicine will ultimately require databases of genes and mutations for healthcare providers to reference in order to understand the clinical implications of each patient’s genetic makeup. Although the highest quality databases require manual curation, text mining tools can facilitate the curation process, increasing accuracy, coverage, and productivity. However, to date there are no available text mining tools that offer high-accuracy performance for extracting such triplets from biomedical literature. In this paper we propose a high-performance machine learning approach to automate the extraction of disease-gene-variant triplets from biomedical literature. Our approach is unique because we identify the genes and protein products associated with each mutation from not just the local text content, but from a global context as well (from the Internet and from all literature in PubMed). Our approach also incorporates protein sequence validation and disease association using a novel text-mining-based machine learning approach. We extract disease-gene-variant triplets from all abstracts in PubMed related to a set of ten important diseases (breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, lung cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, Alzheimer’s disease, hemochromatosis, age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetes mellitus, and cystic fibrosis). We then evaluate our approach in two ways: (1) a direct comparison with the state of the art using benchmark datasets; (2) a validation study comparing the results of our approach with entries in a popular human-curated database (UniProt) for each of the previously mentioned diseases. In the benchmark comparison, our full approach achieves a 28% improvement in F1-measure (from 0.62 to 0.79) over the state-of-the-art results. For the validation study with UniProt Knowledgebase (KB), we present a thorough analysis of the results and errors. Across all diseases, our approach returned 272 triplets (disease-gene-variant) that overlapped with entries in UniProt and 5,384 triplets without overlap in UniProt. Analysis of the overlapping triplets and of a stratified sample of the non-overlapping triplets revealed accuracies of 93% and 80% for the respective categories (cumulative accuracy, 77%). We conclude that our process represents an important and broadly applicable improvement to the state of the art for curation of disease-gene-variant relationships."
2019,Comparison of a Deep Learning Risk Score and Standard Mammographic Density Score for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction.,"Background Most risk prediction models for breast cancer are based on questionnaires and mammographic density assessments. By training a deep neural network, further information in the mammographic images can be considered. Purpose To develop a risk score that is associated with future breast cancer and compare it with density-based models. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, all women aged 40-74 years within the Karolinska University Hospital uptake area in whom breast cancer was diagnosed in 2013-2014 were included along with healthy control subjects. Network development was based on cases diagnosed from 2008 to 2012. The deep learning (DL) risk score, dense area, and percentage density were calculated for the earliest available digital mammographic examination for each woman. Logistic regression models were fitted to determine the association with subsequent breast cancer. False-negative rates were obtained for the DL risk score, age-adjusted dense area, and age-adjusted percentage density. Results A total of 2283 women, 278 of whom were later diagnosed with breast cancer, were evaluated. The age at mammography (mean, 55.7 years vs 54.6 years; P < .001), the dense area (mean, 38.2 cm2 vs 34.2 cm2; P < .001), and the percentage density (mean, 25.6% vs 24.0%; P < .001) were higher among women diagnosed with breast cancer than in those without a breast cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were higher for age-adjusted DL risk score than for dense area and percentage density: 1.56 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.48, 1.64; AUC, 0.65), 1.31 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.38; AUC, 0.60), and 1.18 (95% CI: 1.11, 1.25; AUC, 0.57), respectively (P < .001 for AUC). The false-negative rate was lower: 31% (95% CI: 29%, 34%), 36% (95% CI: 33%, 39%; P = .006), and 39% (95% CI: 37%, 42%; P < .001); this difference was most pronounced for more aggressive cancers. Conclusion Compared with density-based models, a deep neural network can more accurately predict which women are at risk for future breast cancer, with a lower false-negative rate for more aggressive cancers. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

2022,Computational Technique Based on Machine Learning and Image Processing for Medical Image Analysis of Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Breast cancer is the most lethal type of cancer for all women worldwide. At the moment, there are no effective techniques for preventing or curing breast cancer, as the source of the disease is unclear. Early diagnosis is a highly successful means of detecting and managing breast cancer, and early identification may result in a greater likelihood of complete recovery. Mammography is the most effective method of detecting breast cancer early. Additionally, this instrument enables the detection of additional illnesses and may provide information about the nature of cancer, such as benign, malignant, or normal. This article discusses an evolutionary approach for classifying and detecting breast cancer that is based on machine learning and image processing. This model combines image preprocessing, feature extraction, feature selection, and machine learning techniques to aid in the classification and identification of skin diseases. To enhance the image’s quality, a geometric mean filter is used. AlexNet is used for extracting features. Feature selection is performed using the relief algorithm. For disease categorization and detection, the model makes use of the machine learning techniques such as least square support vector machine, KNN, random forest, and Naïve Bayes. The experimental investigation makes use of MIAS data collection. This proposed technology is advantageous for accurately identifying breast cancer disease using image analysis."
2020,Cancer in Lockdown: Impact of the COVID‐19 Pandemic on Patients with Cancer,"Abstract The lockdown measures of the ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic have disengaged patients with cancer from formal health care settings, leading to an increased use of social media platforms to address unmet needs and expectations. Although remote health technologies have addressed some of the medical needs, the emotional and mental well‐being of these patients remain underexplored and underreported. We used a validated artificial intelligence framework to conduct a comprehensive real‐time analysis of two data sets of 2,469,822 tweets and 21,800 discussions by patients with cancer during this pandemic. Lung and breast cancer are most prominently discussed, and the most concerns were expressed regarding delayed diagnosis, cancellations, missed treatments, and weakened immunity. All patients expressed significant negative sentiment, with fear being the predominant emotion. Even as some lockdown measures ease, it is crucial that patients with cancer are engaged using social media platforms for real‐time identification of issues and the provision of informational and emotional support."
2021,AI-based Strategies to Reduce Workload in Breast Cancer Screening with Mammography and Tomosynthesis: A Retrospective Evaluation.,"Background The workflow of breast cancer screening programs could be improved given the high workload and the high number of false-positive and false-negative assessments. Purpose To evaluate if using an artificial intelligence (AI) system could reduce workload without reducing cancer detection in breast cancer screening with digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired from January 2015 to December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the Córdoba Tomosynthesis Screening Trial. The original reading settings were single or double reading of DM or DBT images. An AI system computed a cancer risk score for DM and DBT examinations independently. Each original setting was compared with a simulated autonomous AI triaging strategy (the least suspicious examinations for AI are not human-read; the rest are read in the same setting as the original, and examinations not recalled by radiologists but graded as very suspicious by AI are recalled) in terms of workload, sensitivity, and recall rate. The McNemar test with Bonferroni correction was used for statistical analysis. Results A total of 15 987 DM and DBT examinations (which included 98 screening-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 986 women (mean age ± standard deviation, 58 years ± 6) were evaluated. In comparison with double reading of DBT images (568 hours needed, 92 of 113 cancers detected, 706 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 72.5% less workload (P < .001, 156 hours needed), noninferior sensitivity (95 of 113 cancers detected, P = .38), and 16.7% lower recall rate (P < .001, 588 recalls in 15 987 examinations). Similar results were obtained for AI with DM. In comparison with the original double reading of DM images (222 hours needed, 76 of 113 cancers detected, 807 recalls in 15 987 examinations), AI with DBT would result in 29.7% less workload (P < .001), 25.0% higher sensitivity (P < .001), and 27.1% lower recall rate (P < .001). Conclusion Digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis screening strategies based on artificial intelligence systems could reduce workload up to 70%. Published under a CC BY 4.0 license."
2019,Surface-Functionalized Modified Copper Sulfide Nanoparticles Enhance Checkpoint Blockade Tumor Immunotherapy by Photothermal Therapy and Antigen Capturing.,"Nanomaterial-based tumor photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted increasing attention and been a promising method for cancer treatment because of its low level of adverse effects and noninvasiveness. However, thermotherapy alone still cannot control tumor metastasis and recurrence. Here, we developed surface-functionalized modified copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs). CuS NPs can not only be used as photothermal mediators for tumor hyperthermia but can adsorb tumor antigens released during hyperthermia as an antigen-capturing agent to induce antitumor immune response. We selected maleimide polyethylene glycol-modified CuS NPs (CuS NPs-PEG-Mal) with stronger antigen adsorption capacity, in combination with an immune checkpoint blocker (anti-PD-L1) to evaluate the effect of hyperthermia, improving immunotherapy in a 4T1 breast cancer tumor model. The results showed that hyperthermia based on CuS NPs-PEG-Mal distinctly increased the levels of inflammatory cytokines in the serum, leading to a tumor immunogenic microenvironment. In cooperation with anti-PD-L1, PTT mediated by CuS NPs-PEG-Mal enhanced the number of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and inhibited the growth in primary and distant tumor sites of the 4T1 tumor model. The therapeutic strategies provide a simple and effective treatment option for metastatic and recurrent tumors."
2018,Breast cancer detection in mammograms using convolutional neural network,"Breast cancer is among world's second most occurring cancer in all types of cancer. Most common cancer among women worldwide is breast cancer. There is always need of advancement when it comes to medical imaging. Early detection of cancer followed by the proper treatment can reduce the risk of deaths. Machine learning can help medical professionals to diagnose the disease with more accuracy. Where deep learning or neural networks is one of the techniques which can be used for the classification of normal and abnormal breast detection. CNN can be used for this detection. Mammograms-MIAS dataset is used for this purpose, having 322 mammograms in which almost 189 images are of normal and 133 are of abnormal breasts. Promising experimental results have been obtained which depict the efficacy of deep learning for breast cancer detection in mammogram images and further encourage the use of deep learning based modern feature extraction and classification methods in various medical imaging applications especially in breast cancer detection. It is an ongoing research and further developments are being made by optimizing the CNN architecture and also employing pre-trained networks which will hopefully lead to higher accuracy measures. Proper segmentation is mandatory for efficient feature extraction and classification."
2019,Parallel Structure Deep Neural Network Using CNN and RNN with an Attention Mechanism for Breast Cancer Histology Image Classification,"In this paper, we present a new deep learning model to classify hematoxylin–eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes (normal tissues, benign lesions, in situ carcinomas, and invasive carcinomas). Our model uses a parallel structure consist of a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a recurrent neural network (RNN) for image feature extraction, which is greatly different from the common existed serial method of extracting image features by CNN and then inputting them into RNN. Then, we introduce a special perceptron attention mechanism, which is derived from the natural language processing (NLP) field, to unify the features extracted by the two different neural network structures of the model. In the convolution layer, general batch normalization is replaced by the new switchable normalization method. And the latest regularization technology, targeted dropout, is used to substitute for the general dropout in the last three fully connected layers of the model. In the testing phase, we use the model fusion method and test time augmentation technology on three different datasets of hematoxylin–eosin-stained breast biopsy images. The results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods."
2019,A Technical Review of Convolutional Neural Network-Based Mammographic Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"This study reviews the technique of convolutional neural network (CNN) applied in a specific field of mammographic breast cancer diagnosis (MBCD). It aims to provide several clues on how to use CNN for related tasks. MBCD is a long-standing problem, and massive computer-aided diagnosis models have been proposed. The models of CNN-based MBCD can be broadly categorized into three groups. One is to design shallow or to modify existing models to decrease the time cost as well as the number of instances for training; another is to make the best use of a pretrained CNN by transfer learning and fine-tuning; the third is to take advantage of CNN models for feature extraction, and the differentiation of malignant lesions from benign ones is fulfilled by using machine learning classifiers. This study enrolls peer-reviewed journal publications and presents technical details and pros and cons of each model. Furthermore, the findings, challenges and limitations are summarized and some clues on the future work are also given. Conclusively, CNN-based MBCD is at its early stage, and there is still a long way ahead in achieving the ultimate goal of using deep learning tools to facilitate clinical practice. This review benefits scientific researchers, industrial engineers, and those who are devoted to intelligent cancer diagnosis."
2019,Classification of Histopathological Biopsy Images Using Ensemble of Deep Learning Networks,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death across the world in women. Early diagnosis of this type of cancer is critical for treatment and patient care. Computer-aided detection (CAD) systems using convolutional neural networks (CNN) could assist in the classification of abnormalities. In this study, we proposed an ensemble deep learning-based approach for automatic binary classification of breast histology images. The proposed ensemble model adapts three pre-trained CNNs, namely VGG19, MobileNet, and DenseNet. The ensemble model is used for the feature representation and extraction steps. The extracted features are then fed into a multi-layer perceptron classifier to carry out the classification task. Various pre-processing and CNN tuning techniques such as stain-normalization, data augmentation, hyperparameter tuning, and fine-tuning are used to train the model. The proposed method is validated on four publicly available benchmark datasets, i.e., ICIAR, BreakHis, PatchCamelyon, and Bioimaging. The proposed multi-model ensemble method obtains better predictions than single classifiers and machine learning algorithms with accuracies of 98.13%, 95.00%, 94.64% and 83.10% for BreakHis, ICIAR, PatchCamelyon and Bioimaging datasets, respectively."
2020,Visualization nanozyme based on tumor microenvironment “unlocking” for intensive combination therapy of breast cancer,"The combination between visualization nanozyme and tumor vascular normalization contributes to the therapy of breast cancer. Nanozymes as artificial enzymes that mimicked natural enzyme–like activities have received great attention in cancer therapy. However, it remains a great challenge to design nanozymes that precisely exert its activity in tumor without producing off-target toxicity to surrounding normal tissues. Here, we report a synergetic enhancement strategy through the combination between nanozyme and tumor vascular normalization to destruct tumors, which was based on tumor microenvironment (TME) “unlocking.” This nanozyme that we developed not only has photothermal properties but also can produce reactive oxygen species efficiently under the stimulation of TME. Moreover, this nanozyme also showed remarkable imaging performance in fluorescence imaging in the second near-infrared region and magnetic resonance imaging for visualization tracing in vivo. The process of combination therapy showed remarkable therapeutic effect for breast cancer. This study provides a therapeutic strategy by the cooperation between multifunctional nanozyme and tumor vascular normalization for intensive combination therapy of breast cancer."
2022,Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification on Ultrasound Images,"Simple Summary In the literature, there exist plenty of research works focused on the detection and classification of breast cancer. However, only a few works have focused on the classification of breast cancer using ultrasound scan images. Although deep transfer learning models are useful in breast cancer classification, owing to their outstanding performance in a number of applications, image pre-processing and segmentation techniques are essential. In this context, the current study developed a new Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using ultrasound images. In the study, an optimal multi-level thresholding-based image segmentation technique was designed to identify the tumor-affected regions. The study also developed an ensemble of three deep learning models for feature extraction and an optimal machine learning classifier for breast cancer detection. The study offers a means of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in the breast cancer classification process. Abstract Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) provide an efficient way to diagnose the presence of diseases such as breast cancer using ultrasound images (USIs). Globally, breast cancer is one of the major causes of increased mortality rates among women. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models are widely employed in the detection and classification of tumors in USIs. The CAD systems are designed in such a way that they provide recommendations to help radiologists in diagnosing breast tumors and, furthermore, in disease prognosis. The accuracy of the classification process is decided by the quality of images and the radiologist’s experience. The design of Deep Learning (DL) models is found to be effective in the classification of breast cancer. In the current study, an Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification (EDLCDS-BCDC) technique was developed using USIs. The proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique was intended to identify the existence of breast cancer using USIs. In this technique, USIs initially undergo pre-processing through two stages, namely wiener filtering and contrast enhancement. Furthermore, Chaotic Krill Herd Algorithm (CKHA) is applied with Kapur’s entropy (KE) for the image segmentation process. In addition, an ensemble of three deep learning models, VGG-16, VGG-19, and SqueezeNet, is used for feature extraction. Finally, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is utilized to classify the images based on whether breast cancer exists or not. A wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark databases and the extensive results highlight the better outcomes of the proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique over recent methods."
2016,Automatic prediction of tumour malignancy in breast cancer with fractal dimension,"Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer today in women. The main avenue of diagnosis is through manual examination of histopathology tissue slides. Such a process is often subjective and error-ridden, suffering from both inter- and intraobserver variability. Our objective is to develop an automatic algorithm for analysing histopathology slides free of human subjectivity. Here, we calculate the fractal dimension of images of numerous breast cancer slides, at magnifications of 40×, 100×, 200× and 400×. Using machine learning, specifically, the support vector machine (SVM) method, the F1 score for classification accuracy of the 40× slides was found to be 0.979. Multiclass classification on the 40× slides yielded an accuracy of 0.556. A reduction of the size and scope of the SVM training set gave an average F1 score of 0.964. Taken together, these results show great promise in the use of fractal dimension to predict tumour malignancy."
2019,Comparison of Machine Learning Methods for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Cancer is the common problem for all people in the world with all types. Particularly, Breast Cancer is the most frequent disease as a cancer type for women. Therefore, any development for diagnosis and prediction of cancer disease is capital important for a healthy life. Machine learning techniques can make a huge contribute on the process of early diagnosis and prediction of cancer. In this paper, two of the most popular machine learning techniques have been used for classification of Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Original) dataset and the classification performance of these techniques have been compared with each other using the values of accuracy, precision, recall and ROC Area. The best performance has been obtained by Support Vector Machine technique with the highest accuracy."
2018,Longitudinal Trajectory and Characterization of Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment in a Nationwide Cohort Study.,"PURPOSE Cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) is an important clinical problem in patients with breast cancer receiving chemotherapy. Nationwide longitudinal studies are needed to understand the trajectory and severity of CRCI in specific cognitive domains. PATIENTS AND METHODS The overall objective of this nationwide, prospective, observational study conducted within the National Cancer Institute Community Clinical Oncology Research Program was to assess trajectories in specific cognitive domains in patients with breast cancer (stage I-IIIC) receiving chemotherapy, from pre- (A1) to postchemotherapy (A2) and from prechemotherapy to 6 months postchemotherapy (A3); controls were assessed at the same time-equivalent points. The primary aim assessed visual memory using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery Delayed Match to Sample test by longitudinal mixed models including A1, A2, and A3 and adjusting for age, education, race, cognitive reserve score, and baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms. We also assessed trajectories of CRCI in other aspects of memory as well as in attention and executive function with computerized, paper-based, and telephone-based cognitive tests. RESULTS In total, 580 patients with breast cancer (mean age, 53.4 years) and 363 controls (mean age, 52.6 years) were assessed. On the Delayed Match to Sample test, the longitudinal mixed model results revealed a significant group-by-time effect ( P < .005); patients declined over time from prechemotherapy (A1) to 6 months postchemotherapy (A3; P = .005), but controls did not change ( P = .426). The group difference between patients and controls was also significant, revealing declines in patients but not controls ( P = .017). Several other models of computerized, standard, and telephone tests indicated significantly worse performance by patients compared with controls from pre- to postchemotherapy and from prechemotherapy to 6 months postchemotherapy. CONCLUSION This nationwide study showed CRCI in patients with breast cancer affects multiple cognitive domains for at least 6 months postchemotherapy."
2019,Deep Learning Approaches for Data Augmentation and Classification of Breast Masses using Ultrasound Images,"Breast classification and detection using ultrasound imaging is considered a significant step in computer-aided diagno-sis systems. Over the previous decades, researchers have proved the opportunities to automate the initial tumor classification and detection. The shortage of popular datasets of ultrasound images of breast cancer prevents researchers from obtaining a good performance of the classification algorithms. Traditional augmentation approaches are firmly limited, especially in tasks where the images follow strict standards, as in the case of medical datasets. Therefore besides the traditional augmentation, we use a new methodology for data augmentation using Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). We achieved higher accuracies by integrating traditional with GAN-based augmentation. This paper uses two breast ultrasound image datasets obtained from two various ultrasound systems. The first dataset is our dataset which was collected from Baheya Hospital for Early Detection and Treatment of Women’s Cancer, Cairo (Egypt), we name it (BUSI) referring to Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset. It contains 780 images (133 normal, 437 benign and 210 malignant). While the Dataset (B) is obtained from related work and it has 163 images (110 benign and 53 malignant). To overcome the shortage of public datasets in this field, BUSI dataset will be publicly available for researchers. Moreover, in this paper, deep learning approaches are proposed to be used for breast ultrasound classification. We examine two different methods: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) approach and a Transfer Learning (TL) approach and we compare their performance with and without augmentation. The results confirm an overall enhancement using augmentation methods with deep learning classification methods (especially transfer learning) when evaluated on the two datasets."
2020,Improved Threshold Based and Trainable Fully Automated Segmentation for Breast Cancer Boundary and Pectoral Muscle in Mammogram Images,"Segmentation of the breast region and pectoral muscle are fundamental subsequent steps in the process of Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems. Segmenting the breast region and pectoral muscle are considered a difficult task, particularly in mammogram images because of artefacts, homogeneity among the region of the breast and pectoral muscle, and low contrast along the region of breast boundary, the similarity between the texture of the Region of Interest (ROI), and the unwanted region and irregular ROI. This study aims to propose an improved threshold-based and trainable segmentation model to derive ROI. A hybrid segmentation approach for the boundary of the breast region and pectoral muscle in mammogram images was established based on thresholding and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. For breast boundary estimation, the region of the breast was highlighted by eliminating bands of the wavelet transform. The initial breast boundary was determined through a new thresholding technique. Morphological operations and masking were employed to correct the overestimated boundary by deleting small objects. In the medical imaging field, significant progress to develop effective and accurate ML methods for the segmentation process. In the literature, the imperative role of ML methods in enabling effective and more accurate segmentation method has been highlighted. In this study, an ML technique was built based on the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) feature with neural network classifiers to determine the region of pectoral muscle and ROI. The proposed segmentation approach was tested by utilizing 322, 200, 100 mammogram images from mammographic image analysis society (mini-MIAS), INbreast, Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR) databases, respectively. The experimental results were compared with manual segmentation based on different texture features. Moreover, evaluation and comparison for the boundary of the breast region and pectoral muscle segmentation have been done separately. The experimental results showed that the boundary of the breast region and the pectoral muscle segmentation approach obtained an accuracy of 98.13% and 98.41% (mini-MIAS), 100%, and 98.01% (INbreast), and 99.8% and 99.5% (BCDR), respectively. On average, the proposed study achieved 99.31% accuracy for the boundary of breast region segmentation and 98.64% accuracy for pectoral muscle segmentation. The overall ROI performance of the proposed method showed improving accuracy after improving the threshold technique for background segmentation and building an ML technique for pectoral muscle segmentation. More so, this article also included the ground-truth as an evaluation of comprehensive similarity. In the clinic, this analysis may be provided as a valuable support for breast cancer identification."
2018,Integrating Feature Selection and Feature Extraction Methods With Deep Learning to Predict Clinical Outcome of Breast Cancer,"In many microarray studies, classifiers have been constructed based on gene signatures to predict clinical outcomes for various cancer sufferers. However, signatures originating from different studies often suffer from poor robustness when used in the classification of data sets independent from which they were generated from. In this paper, we present an unsupervised feature learning framework by integrating a principal component analysis algorithm and autoencoder neural network to identify different characteristics from gene expression profiles. As the foundation for the obtained features, an ensemble classifier based on the AdaBoost algorithm (PCA-AE-Ada) was constructed to predict clinical outcomes in breast cancer. During the experiments, we established an additional classifier with the same classifier learning strategy (PCA-Ada) in order to perform as a baseline to the proposed method, where the only difference is the training inputs. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve index, Matthews correlation coefficient index, accuracy, and other evaluation parameters of the proposed method were tested on several independent breast cancer data sets and compared with representative gene signature-based algorithms including the baseline method. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method using deep learning techniques performs better than others."
2022,DeepST: identifying spatial domains in spatial transcriptomics by deep learning,"Abstract Recent advances in spatial transcriptomics (ST) have brought unprecedented opportunities to understand tissue organization and function in spatial context. However, it is still challenging to precisely dissect spatial domains with similar gene expression and histology in situ. Here, we present DeepST, an accurate and universal deep learning framework to identify spatial domains, which performs better than the existing state-of-the-art methods on benchmarking datasets of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Further testing on a breast cancer ST dataset, we showed that DeepST can dissect spatial domains in cancer tissue at a finer scale. Moreover, DeepST can achieve not only effective batch integration of ST data generated from multiple batches or different technologies, but also expandable capabilities for processing other spatial omics data. Together, our results demonstrate that DeepST has the exceptional capacity for identifying spatial domains, making it a desirable tool to gain novel insights from ST studies."
2018,Multi-Class Breast Cancer Classification using Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network,"Breast cancer continues to be among the leading causes of death for women and much effort has been expended in the form of screening programs for prevention. Given the exponential growth in the number of mammograms collected by these programs, computer-assisted diagnosis has become a necessity. Computer-assisted detection techniques developed to date to improve diagnosis without multiple systematic readings have not resulted in a significant improvement in performance measures. In this context, the use of automatic image processing techniques resulting from deep learning represents a promising avenue for assisting in the diagnosis of breast cancer. In this paper, we present a deep learning approach based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for multi-class breast cancer classification. The proposed approach aims to classify the breast tumors in non-just benign or malignant but we predict the subclass of the tumors like Fibroadenoma, Lobular carcinoma, etc. Experimental results on histopathological images using the BreakHis dataset show that the DenseNet CNN model achieved high processing performances with 95.4% of accuracy in the multi-class breast cancer classification task when compared with state-of-the-art models."
2019,Deep-learning approach to identifying cancer subtypes using high-dimensional genomic data,"MOTIVATION Cancer subtype classification has the potential to significantly improve disease prognosis and develop individualized patient management. Existing methods are limited by their ability to handle extremely high-dimensional data and by the influence of misleading, irrelevant factors, resulting in ambiguous and overlapping subtypes. RESULTS To address the above issues, we proposed a novel approach to disentangling and eliminating irrelevant factors by leveraging the power of deep learning. Specifically, we designed a deep learning framework, referred to as DeepType, that performs joint supervised classification, unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction to learn cancer-relevant data representation with cluster structure. We applied DeepType to the METABRIC breast cancer dataset and compared its performance to state-of-the-art methods. DeepType significantly outperformed the existing methods, identifying more robust subtypes while using fewer genes. The new approach provides a framework for the derivation of more accurate and robust molecular cancer subtypes by using increasingly complex, multi-source data. AVAILABILITY An open-source software package for the proposed method is freely available at www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~yijunsun/lab/DeepType.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
2016,Breast Cancer Detection Using K-Nearest Neighbor Machine Learning Algorithm,"Breast cancer is very popular between females all over the world. However, detecting this cancer in its first stages helps in saving lives. Radiologists can predict if the mammography images have cancer or not, but they may miss about 15% of them. In this paper, we propose a new method to detect the breast cancer with high accuracy. This method consists of two main parts, in the first part the image processing techniques are used to prepare the mammography images for feature and pattern extraction process. The second part is presented by utilizing the extracted features as an input for a two types of supervised learning models, which are Back Propagation Neural Network (BPNN) model and the Logistic Regression (LR) model. In this paper we examined the accuracy of these models. The results showed that the LR model utilized more features than the BPNN."
2019,Artificial Intelligence Algorithms to Assess Hormonal Status From Tissue Microarrays in Patients With Breast Cancer,"Key Points Question Can molecular markers of cancer be extracted from tissue morphology as seen in hematoxylin-eosin–stained images? Findings In this diagnostic study of tissue microarray hematoxylin-eosin–stained images from 5356 patients with breast cancer, molecular biomarker expression was found to be significantly associated with tissue histomorphology. A deep learning model was able to predict estrogen receptor expression solely from hematoxylin-eosin–stained images with noninferior accuracy to standard immunohistochemistry. Meaning These results suggest that deep learning models may assist pathologists in molecular profiling of cancer with practically no added cost and time."
2018,Cancer Metastasis Detection With Neural Conditional Random Field,"Breast cancer diagnosis often requires accurate detection of metastasis in lymph nodes through Whole-slide Images (WSIs). Recent advances in deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown significant successes in medical image analysis and particularly in computational histopathology. Because of the outrageous large size of WSIs, most of the methods divide one slide into lots of small image patches and perform classification on each patch independently. However, neighboring patches often share spatial correlations, and ignoring these spatial correlations may result in inconsistent predictions. In this paper, we propose a neural conditional random field (NCRF) deep learning framework to detect cancer metastasis in WSIs. NCRF considers the spatial correlations between neighboring patches through a fully connected CRF which is directly incorporated on top of a CNN feature extractor. The whole deep network can be trained end-to-end with standard back-propagation algorithm with minor computational overhead from the CRF component. The CNN feature extractor can also benefit from considering spatial correlations via the CRF component. Compared to the baseline method without considering spatial correlations, we show that the proposed NCRF framework obtains probability maps of patch predictions with better visual quality. We also demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline in cancer metastasis detection on the Camelyon16 dataset and achieves an average FROC score of 0.8096 on the test set. NCRF is open sourced at this https URL."
2019,Biomimetic Platinum Nanozyme Immobilized on 2D Metal-Organic Frameworks for Mitochondria-targeting and Oxygen Self-supply Photodynamic Therapy.,"Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) as a noninvasive therapy mode has attracted considerable attention in the field of oncotherapy. However, the PDT efficacy is restricted either by tumor hypoxia environment or the inherent properties of photosensitizers (PSs) including bad water solution, photobleaching, and easy aggregation. Herein, we designed and synthesized a new 2D metal-organic framework Sm-TCPP nanosheets by assembling transition metal ion (Sm3+) and PSs (TCPP), on which the catalase (CAT)-mimicking platinum nanozyme were then in situ grown for sufficient oxygen supply during PDT. The prepared Sm-TCPP with nanoplate morphology (~100 nm in diameter) and ultrathin thickness (<10 nm) showed significantly enhanced 1O2 generation capacity due to the improved physicochemical property and the enhanced intersystem crossing from heavy Sm nodes. More importantly, the CAT-mimicking Pt nanozyme on the Sm-TCPP nanosheets could effectively convert over-expressed H2O2 in tumor microenvironment (TME) into O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia. Further, triphenylphosphine (TPP) molecule was introduced to Sm-TCPP-Pt for an mitochondria-targeting and O2 self-supply PDT system. The experimental results in vitro and in vivo based on MCF-7 breast cancer model revealed that Sm-TCPP-Pt/TPP could relieve tumor hypoxia, and the generated ROS nearby intracellular mitochondria significantly induced cell apoptosis. This study offers an engineering strategy to integrate 2D PSs-based MOF and nanozymes into a nanoplatform to surmount the pitfalls of traditional PDT."
2017,A method for classifying medical images using transfer learning: A pilot study on histopathology of breast cancer,"The advance of deep learning has made huge changes in computer vision and produced various off-the-shelf trained models. Particularly, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been widely used to build image classification model which allow researchers transfer the pre-trained learning model for other classifications. We propose a transfer learning method to detect breast cancer using histopathology images based on Google's Inception v3 model which were initially trained for the classification of non-medical images. The pilot study shows the feasibility of transfer learning in the detection of breast cancer with AUC of 0.93."
2016,Antibody-supervised deep learning for quantification of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in hematoxylin and eosin stained breast cancer samples,"Background: Immune cell infiltration in tumor is an emerging prognostic biomarker in breast cancer. The gold standard for quantification of immune cells in tissue sections is visual assessment through a microscope, which is subjective and semi-quantitative. In this study, we propose and evaluate an approach based on antibody-guided annotation and deep learning to quantify immune cell-rich areas in hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained samples. Methods: Consecutive sections of formalin-fixed parafin-embedded samples obtained from the primary tumor of twenty breast cancer patients were cut and stained with H&E and the pan-leukocyte CD45 antibody. The stained slides were digitally scanned, and a training set of immune cell-rich and cell-poor tissue regions was annotated in H&E whole-slide images using the CD45-expression as a guide. In analysis, the images were divided into small homogenous regions, superpixels, from which features were extracted using a pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) and classified with a support of vector machine. The CNN approach was compared to texture-based classification and to visual assessments performed by two pathologists. Results: In a set of 123,442 labeled superpixels, the CNN approach achieved an F-score of 0.94 (range: 0.92-0.94) in discrimination of immune cell-rich and cell-poor regions, as compared to an F-score of 0.88 (range: 0.87-0.89) obtained with the texture-based classification. When compared to visual assessment of 200 images, an agreement of 90% (k = 0.79) to quantify immune infiltration with the CNN approach was achieved while the inter-observer agreement between pathologists was 90% (k = 0.78). Conclusions: Our findings indicate that deep learning can be applied to quantify immune cell infiltration in breast cancer samples using a basic morphology staining only. A good discrimination of immune cell-rich areas was achieved, well in concordance with both leukocyte antigen expression and pathologists′ visual assessment."
2017,Detection and classification of the breast abnormalities in digital mammograms via regional Convolutional Neural Network,"Automatic detection and classification of the masses in mammograms are still a big challenge and play a crucial role to assist radiologists for accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel computer-aided diagnose (CAD) system based on one of the regional deep learning techniques: a ROI-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is called You Only Look Once (YOLO). Our proposed YOLO-based CAD system contains four main stages: mammograms preprocessing, feature extraction utilizing multi convolutional deep layers, mass detection with confidence model, and finally mass classification using fully connected neural network (FC-NN). A set of training mammograms with the information of ROI masses and their types are used to train YOLO. The trained YOLO-based CAD system detects the masses and classifies their types into benign or malignant. Our results show that the proposed YOLO-based CAD system detects the mass location with an overall accuracy of 96.33%. The system also distinguishes between benign and malignant lesions with an overall accuracy of 85.52%. Our proposed system seems to be feasible as a CAD system capable of detection and classification at the same time. It also overcomes some challenging breast cancer cases such as the mass existing in the pectoral muscles or dense regions."
2020,Breast Tumor Segmentation in 3D Automatic Breast Ultrasound Using Mask Scoring R-CNN.,"PURPOSE Automatic breast ultrasound (ABUS) imaging has become an essential tool in breast cancer diagnosis since it provides complementary information to other imaging modalities. Lesion segmentation on ABUS is a prerequisite step of breast cancer computer-aided diagnosis (CAD). This work aims to develop a deep learning-based method for breast tumor segmentation using three-dimensional ABUS automatically. METHODS For breast tumor segmentation in ABUS, we developed a Mask scoring region-based convolutional neural network (R-CNN) that consists of five subnetworks, i.e., a backbone, a regional proposal network, a region CNN head, a mask head, and a mask score head. A network block building direct correlation between mask quality and region class was integrated into a Mask scoring R-CNN based framework for the segmentation of new ABUS images with ambiguous regions of interest (ROIs). For segmentation accuracy evaluation, we retrospectively investigated 70 patients with breast tumor confirmed with needle biopsy and manually delineated on ABUS, of which 40 were used for five-fold cross-validation and 30 were used for hold-out test. The comparison between the automatic breast tumor segmentations and the manual contours was quantified by I) six metrics including Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard index, 95% Hausdorff distance (HD95), mean surface distance (MSD), residual mean square distance (RMSD), and center of mass distance (CMD); II) Pearson correlation analysis and Bland-Altman analysis. RESULTS The mean (median) DSC was 85% ± 10.4% (89.4%) and 82.1% ± 14.5% (85.6%) for cross validation and hold-out test, respectively. The corresponding HD95, MSD, RMSD and CMD of the two tests was 1.646 ± 1.191 and 1.665 ± 1.129 mm, 0.489 ± 0.406 and 0.475 ± 0.371 mm, 0.755 ± 0.755 and 0.751 ± 0.508 mm, and 0.672 ± 0.612 and 0.665 ± 0.729 mm. The mean volumetric difference (mean and ± 1.96 standard deviation) was 0.47 cc ([-0.77, 1.71)) for the cross-validation and 0.23 cc ([-0.23 0.69]) for hold-out test respectively. CONCLUSION We developed a novel Mask scoring R-CNN approach for the automated segmentation of the breast tumor in ABUS images and demonstrated its accuracy for breast tumor segmentation. Our learning-based method can potentially assist the clinical CAD of breast cancer using 3D ABUS imaging."
2018,Deep Learning to Distinguish Recalled but Benign Mammography Images in Breast Cancer Screening,"Purpose: False positives in digital mammography screening lead to high recall rates, resulting in unnecessary medical procedures to patients and health care costs. This study aimed to investigate the revolutionary deep learning methods to distinguish recalled but benign mammography images from negative exams and those with malignancy. Experimental Design: Deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) models were constructed to classify mammography images into malignant (breast cancer), negative (breast cancer free), and recalled-benign categories. A total of 14,860 images of 3,715 patients from two independent mammography datasets: Full-Field Digital Mammography Dataset (FFDM) and a digitized film dataset, Digital Dataset of Screening Mammography (DDSM), were used in various settings for training and testing the CNN models. The ROC curve was generated and the AUC was calculated as a metric of the classification accuracy. Results: Training and testing using only the FFDM dataset resulted in AUC ranging from 0.70 to 0.81. When the DDSM dataset was used, AUC ranged from 0.77 to 0.96. When datasets were combined for training and testing, AUC ranged from 0.76 to 0.91. When pretrained on a large nonmedical dataset and DDSM, the models showed consistent improvements in AUC ranging from 0.02 to 0.05 (all P > 0.05), compared with pretraining only on the nonmedical dataset. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that automatic deep learning CNN methods can identify nuanced mammographic imaging features to distinguish recalled-benign images from malignant and negative cases, which may lead to a computerized clinical toolkit to help reduce false recalls."
2017,Discriminating solitary cysts from soft tissue lesions in mammography using a pretrained deep convolutional neural network,"Purpose: It is estimated that 7% of women in the western world will develop palpable breast cysts in their lifetime. Even though cysts have been correlated with risk of developing breast cancer, many of them are benign and do not require follow‐up. We develop a method to discriminate benign solitary cysts from malignant masses in digital mammography. We think a system like this can have merit in the clinic as a decision aid or complementary to specialized modalities. Methods: We employ a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify cyst and mass patches. Deep CNNs have been shown to be powerful classifiers, but need a large amount of training data for which medical problems are often difficult to come by. The key contribution of this paper is that we show good performance can be obtained on a small dataset by pretraining the network on a large dataset of a related task. We subsequently investigate the following: (a) when a mammographic exam is performed, two different views of the same breast are recorded. We investigate the merit of combining the output of the classifier from these two views. (b) We evaluate the importance of the resolution of the patches fed to the network. (c) A method dubbed tissue augmentation is subsequently employed, where we extract normal tissue from normal patches and superimpose this onto the actual samples aiming for a classifier invariant to occluding tissue. (d) We combine the representation extracted using the deep CNN with our previously developed features. Results: We show that using the proposed deep learning method, an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.80 can be obtained on a set of benign solitary cysts and malignant mass findings recalled in screening. We find that it works significantly better than our previously developed approach by comparing the AUC of the ROC using bootstrapping. By combining views, the results can be further improved, though this difference was not found to be significant. We find no significant difference between using a resolution of 100 versus 200 micron. The proposed tissue augmentations give a small improvement in performance, but this improvement was also not found to be significant. The final system obtained an AUC of 0.80 with 95% confidence interval [0.78, 0.83], calculated using bootstrapping. The system works best for lesions larger than 27 mm where it obtains an AUC value of 0.87. Conclusion: We have presented a computer‐aided diagnosis (CADx) method to discriminate cysts from solid lesion in mammography using features from a deep CNN trained on a large set of mass candidates, obtaining an AUC of 0.80 on a set of diagnostic exams recalled from screening. We believe the system shows great potential and comes close to the performance of recently developed spectral mammography. We think the system can be further improved when more data and computational power becomes available."
2021,IoMT Cloud-Based Intelligent Prediction of Breast Cancer Stages Empowered With Deep Learning,"Breast cancer is often a fatal disease that has a substantial impact on the female mortality rate. Rapidly spreading breast cancer is due to the abnormal growth of malignant cells in the breast. Early detection of breast cancer can increase treatment opportunities and patient survival rates. Various screening methods with computer-aided detection systems have been developed for the effective diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. Image data plays an important role in the medical and health industry. Features are extracted from image datasets through deep learning, as deep learning techniques extract features more accurately and rapidly than other existing methods. Deep learning effectively assists existing methods, such as mammogram screening and biopsy, in examining and diagnosing breast cancer. This paper proposes an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) cloud-based model for the intelligent prediction of breast cancer stages. The proposed model is employed to detect breast cancer and its stages. The experimental results demonstrate 98.86% and 97.81% accuracy for the training and validation phases, respectively. In addition, they demonstrate accuracies of 99.69%, 99.32%, 98.96%, and 99.32% for detecting ductal carcinoma, lobular carcinoma, mucinous carcinoma, and papillary carcinoma. The results of the proposed intelligent prediction of breast cancer stages empowered with the deep learning (IPBCS-DL) model exhibits higher accuracy than existing state-of-the-art methods, indicating its potential to lower the breast cancer mortality rate."
2017,Breast cancer: The translation of big genomic data to cancer precision medicine,"Cancer is a complex genetic disease that develops from the accumulation of genomic alterations in which germline variations predispose individuals to cancer and somatic alterations initiate and trigger the progression of cancer. For the past 2 decades, genomic research has advanced remarkably, evolving from single‐gene to whole‐genome screening by using genome‐wide association study and next‐generation sequencing that contributes to big genomic data. International collaborative efforts have contributed to curating these data to identify clinically significant alterations that could be used in clinical settings. Focusing on breast cancer, the present review summarizes the identification of genomic alterations with high‐throughput screening as well as the use of genomic information in clinical trials that match cancer patients to therapies, which further leads to cancer precision medicine. Furthermore, cancer screening and monitoring were enhanced greatly by the use of liquid biopsies. With the growing data complexity and size, there is much anticipation in exploiting deep machine learning and artificial intelligence to curate integrative “−omics” data to refine the current medical practice to be applied in the near future."
2015,"The lipid-reactive oxygen species phenotype of breast cancer. Raman spectroscopy and mapping, PCA and PLSDA for invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma. Molecular tumorigenic mechanisms beyond Warburg effect.","Vibrational signatures of human breast tissue (invasive ductal carcinoma and invasive lobular carcinoma) were used to identify, characterize and discriminate structures in normal (noncancerous) and cancerous tissues by confocal Raman imaging, Raman spectroscopy and IR spectroscopy. The most important differences between normal and cancerous tissues were found in regions characteristic for vibrations of carotenoids, fatty acids, proteins, and interfacial water. Particular attention was paid to the role played by unsaturated fatty acids and their derivatives. K-means clustering and basis analysis followed by PCA and PLSDA is employed to analyze Raman spectroscopic maps of human breast tissue and for a statistical analysis of the samples (82 patients, 164 samples). Raman maps successfully identify regions of carotenoids, fatty acids, and proteins. The intensities, frequencies and profiles of the average Raman spectra differentiate the biochemical composition of normal and cancerous tissues. The paper demonstrates that Raman imaging has reached a clinically relevant level in regard to breast cancer diagnosis applications. The sensitivity and specificity obtained directly from PLSLD and cross validation are equal to 90.5% and 84.8% for calibration and 84.7% and 71.9% for cross-validation respectively."
2022,Status of cancer screening in India: An alarm signal from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5),"ABSTRACT Background: Cancer is often detected much later to its onset, resulting in poor prognosis. This makes cancer the second most common cause of death globally. Looking for cancers much before any symptoms occur is termed “cancer screening” and is a powerful strategy for prevention, early diagnosis, and better management of several cancers. This paper examines the status of cancer screening in India from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS)-5 report for the period of 2019–2021. Methods: Secondary data on participation in screening for cervical, breast, and oral cancer were extracted from the NFHS-5 report. Participation status for all the above cancer types is represented as percentages and compared across 28 states and eight union territories in India. Results: The percentages of women who have ever undergone cervical, breast, and oral cavity screening were 1.9%, 0.9%, and 0.9%, respectively. About 1.2% of men participated in oral cavity screening. The highest percentage of cervical and breast cancer screening participation was reported in Tamil Nadu (9.8% and 5.6%, respectively), followed by Puducherry (7.4% and 4.2%) and Mizoram (6.9% and 2.7%). Andaman and Nicobar Islands reported the highest oral cancer screening among women (10.1%) while Andhra Pradesh (6.3%) reported the highest participation among men. Conclusion: Cancer screening participation in India is extremely inadequate and calls for the immediate attention of national and state governments. Additional efforts are warranted to improve public awareness of cancer screening, and appropriate measures should be implemented to conduct well-organized screening programs across the country to ensure maximum participation."
2015,Possibility of Breast Cancer Prevention: Use of Soy Isoflavones and Fermented Soy Beverage Produced Using Probiotics,"The various beneficial effects of soybeans, which are rich in phytochemicals, have received much attention because of increasing health awareness. Soy milk that has been fermented using lactic acid bacteria has been used to prepare cheese-like products, tofu (bean-curd), and yogurt-type products. However, the distinct odor of soybeans has limited the acceptance of such foods, particularly in Western countries. In Japan, while tofu and soy milk have long been habitually consumed, the development of novel, palatable food products has not been easy. The unpleasant odor of soy milk and the absorption efficiency for isoflavones can be improved using a recently developed fermented soy milk beverage. Cancer has been the leading cause of death, and breast cancer is the most common malignancy among women. The most common type of breast cancer is estrogen-dependent, and the anti-estrogenic effects of isoflavones are known. The present review focuses on the characteristics of soy milk fermented using probiotics, an epidemiological study examining the incidence of breast cancer and soy isoflavone consumption, and a non-clinical study examining breast cancer prevention using fermented soy milk beverage."
2017,Multifunctional graphene quantum dots for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy coupled with cancer cell tracking applications,"Graphene quantum dots (GQDs) have gained enormous attention due to their unique optical properties and emerging employment in biology. Herein, we report the synthesis of highly crystalline GQDs having superior physicochemical and near infrared (NIR)-responsive properties using simple waste, withered leaves of Ficus racemosa, an Indian fig tree, as a carbon source. A considerably large production yield was obtained (ca. 18%) with a competitive quantum yield of 14.16%. The GQDs exhibited excellent dispersibility in both organic as well as aqueous solvents and were highly photostable. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy showed the presence of ultra-small honey-combed as well as self-assembled GQDs. Cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry and biocompatibility studies showed that the GQDs were cytocompatible and were used as in situ labeling probes for normal as well as cancer cells. Furthermore, upon irradiation with an 808 nm laser (0.5 W cm−2), a concentration-dependent photothermal response and production of reactive oxygen species were observed. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that GQDs did not lose their fluorescence despite continuous laser irradiation (30 min) on MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. Thus, cell death could be traced using GQD-labeled MDA-MB-231 cells post-therapy using the photostability of GQDs, unlike photo-bleachable organic dyes. Thus, a low-cost, scalable, green-synthesis of GQDs with highly efficient optical properties will pave the way for new therapeutics and imaging in biomedical cancer research."

2020,Platinum-based chemotherapy in combination with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors: preclinical and clinical studies and mechanism of action,"ABSTRACT Introduction Platinum chemotherapy is widely used in first-line treatment of patients with various cancers. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors have shown efficacy in several cancers, and the combination of platinum-based chemotherapy and PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors has gradually become the focus of attention. Recently, the combination therapy has exhibited significant effects in preclinical models and clinical trials. Areas covered This review summarizes preclinical and clinical studies of the combination therapy in various cancers, and further explores mechanisms of the treatment. Furthermore, exploration of the mechanism demonstrates that the combination therapy plays a combination role in two ways. On the one hand, the positive effects of platinum-based chemotherapy on immunomodulation can be harnessed to increase the sensitivity of tumor cells to PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. On the other hand, platinum-based chemotherapy may upregulate PD-L1 expression in tumor tissue and exert a negative immunomodulatory effect, which can be counteracted by PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors through their action pathway. What’s more, different types of platinum-based chemotherapy exert different immunomodulation properties. Expert opinion This review describes a potential for the combination of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors and novel nanoparticles composed of platinum-loaded complex to yield positive effects in a wide range of doses, thus achieving higher therapeutic effects and lower side effects.

2014,Enhanced charge transfer by gold nanoparticle at DNA modified electrode and its application to label-free DNA detection.,"Rational utilization of nanomaterials to construct electrochemical nucleic acid sensors has attracted large attention in recent years. In this work, we systematically interrogate the interaction between gold nanoparticles (GNPs) and single-strand DNA (ssDNA) immobilized on an electrode surface and then take advantage of the ultrahigh charge-transfer efficiency of GNPs to develop a novel DNA sensing method. Specifically, ssDNA modified gold electrode can adsorb GNPs because of the interaction between gold and nitrogen-containing bases; thus, the negative electrochemical species [Fe(CN)6](3-/4-) may transfer electrons to electrode through adsorbed GNPs. In the presence of target DNA, the formed double-strand DNA (dsDNA) cannot capture GNPs onto the electrode surface and the dsDNA may result in a large charge-transfer resistance owing to the negatively charged phosphate backbones of DNA. So a simple but sensitive method for the detection of target DNA can be developed by using GNPs without any requirement of modification. Experimental results demonstrate that the electrochemical method we have proposed in this work can detect as low as 1 pM breast cancer gene BRCA1 in a 10 μL sample volume without any signal amplification process or the involvement of other synthesized complex, which may provide an alternative for cancer DNA detection. This method may also be generalized for detecting a spectrum of targets using functional DNA (aptamer, metal-specific oligonucleotide, or DNAzyme) in the future."
2015,Concerns about cancer risk and experiences with genetic testing in a diverse population of patients with breast cancer.,"PURPOSE To evaluate preferences for and experiences with genetic testing in a diverse cohort of patients with breast cancer identified through population-based registries, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity. METHODS We surveyed women diagnosed with nonmetastatic breast cancer from 2005 to 2007, as reported to the SEER registries of metropolitan Los Angeles and Detroit, about experiences with hereditary risk evaluation. Multivariable models evaluated correlates of a strong desire for genetic testing, unmet need for discussion with a health care professional, and receipt of testing. RESULTS Among 1,536 patients who completed the survey, 35% expressed strong desire for genetic testing, 28% reported discussing testing with a health care professional, and 19% reported test receipt. Strong desire for testing was more common in younger women, Latinas, and those with family history. Minority patients were significantly more likely to have unmet need for discussion (failure to discuss genetic testing with a health professional when they had a strong desire for testing): odds ratios of 1.68, 2.44, and 7.39 for blacks, English-speaking Latinas, and Spanish-speaking Latinas compared with whites, respectively. Worry in the long-term survivorship period was higher among those with unmet need for discussion (48.7% v 24.9%; P <.001). Patients who received genetic testing were younger, less likely to be black, and more likely to have a family cancer history. CONCLUSION Many patients, especially minorities, express a strong desire for genetic testing and may benefit from discussion to clarify risks. Clinicians should discuss genetic risk even with patients they perceive to be at low risk, as this may reduce worry."
2014,"Hereditary Breast Cancer: Clinical, Pathological and Molecular Characteristics","Pathogenic mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 are only detected in 25% of families with a strong history of breast cancer, though hereditary factors are expected to be involved in the remaining families with no recognized mutation. Molecular characterization is expected to provide new insight into the tumor biology to guide the search of new high-risk alleles and provide better classification of the growing number of BRCA1/2 variants of unknown significance (VUS). In this review, we provide an overview of hereditary breast cancer, its genetic background, and clinical implications, before focusing on the pathologically and molecular features associated with the disease. Recent transcriptome and genome profiling studies of tumor series from BRCA1/2 mutation carriers as well as familial npn-BRCA1/2 will be discussed. Special attention is paid to its association with molecular breast cancer subtypes as well as the latest advances in predicting BRCA1/2 involvement (BRCAness) using molecular signatures, for improved diagnostics and selection of patients sensitive to targeted therapeutics."
2017,Mobile Phone Apps for Quality of Life and Well-Being Assessment in Breast and Prostate Cancer Patients: Systematic Review,"Background Mobile phone health apps are increasingly gaining attention in oncological care as potential tools for supporting cancer patients. Although the number of publications and health apps focusing on cancer is increasing, there are still few specifically designed for the most prevalent cancers diagnosed: breast and prostate cancers. There is a need to review the effect of these apps on breast and prostate cancer patients’ quality of life (QoL) and well-being. Objective The purposes of this study were to review the scientific literature on mobile phone apps targeting breast or prostate cancer patients and involving QoL and well-being (anxiety and depression symptoms) and analyze the clinical and technological characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of these apps, as well as patients’ user experience with them. Methods We conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature from The Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and MEDLINE to identify studies involving apps focused on breast and/or prostate cancer patients and QoL and/or well-being published between January 1, 2000, and July 12, 2017. Only trial studies which met the inclusion criteria were selected. The systematic review was completed with a critical analysis of the apps previously identified in the health literature research that were available from the official app stores. Results The systematic review of the literature yielded 3862 articles. After removal of duplicates, 3229 remained and were evaluated on the basis of title and abstract. Of these, 3211 were discarded as not meeting the inclusion criteria, and 18 records were selected for full text screening. Finally, 5 citations were included in this review, with a total of 644 patients, mean age 52.16 years. Four studies targeted breast cancer patients and 1 focused on prostate cancer patients. Four studies referred to apps that assessed QoL. Only 1 among the 5 analyzed apps was available from the official app store. In 3 studies, an app-related intervention was carried out, and 2 of them reported an improvement on QoL. The lengths of the app-related interventions varied from 4 to 12 weeks. Because 2 of the studies only tracked use of the app, no effect on QoL or well-being was found. Conclusions Despite the existence of hundreds of studies involving cancer-focused mobile phone apps, there is a lack of rigorous trials regarding the QoL and/or well-being assessment in breast and/or prostate cancer patients. A strong and collective effort should be made by all health care providers to determine those cancer-focused apps that effectively represent useful, accurate, and reliable tools for cancer patients’ disease management.

2017,Nanogap‐Rich Au Nanowire SERS Sensor for Ultrasensitive Telomerase Activity Detection: Application to Gastric and Breast Cancer Tissues Diagnosis,"Telomerase has attracted much attention as a universal cancer biomarker because telomerase is overexpressed in more than 85% of human cancer cells while suppressed in normal somatic cells. Since a strong association exists between telomerase activity and human cancers, the development of effective telomerase activity assay is critically important. Here, a nanogap‐rich Au nanowire (NW) surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) sensor is reported for detection of telomerase activity in various cancer cells and tissues. The nanogap‐rich Au NWs are constructed by deposition of nanoparticles on single‐crystalline Au NWs and provided highly reproducible SERS spectra. The telomeric substrate (TS) primer‐attached nanogap‐rich Au NWs can detect telomerase activity through SERS measurement after the elongation of TS primers, folding into G‐quadruplex structures, and intercalation of methylene blue. This sensor enables us to detect telomerase activity from various cancer cell lines with a detection limit of 0.2 cancer cells mL−1. Importantly, the nanogap‐rich Au NW sensor can diagnose gastric and breast cancer tissues accurately. The nanogap‐rich Au NW sensors show strong SERS signals only in the presence of tumor tissues excised from 16 tumor‐bearing mice, while negligible signals in the presence of heated tumor tissues or normal tissues. It is anticipated that nanogap‐rich Au NW SERS sensors can be used for a universal cancer diagnosis and further biomedical applications including a diverse biomarker sensing."
2018,Evolutionary pruning of transfer learned deep convolutional neural network for breast cancer diagnosis in digital breast tomosynthesis,"Deep learning models are highly parameterized, resulting in difficulty in inference and transfer learning for image recognition tasks. In this work, we propose a layered pathway evolution method to compress a deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) for classification of masses in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). The objective is to prune the number of tunable parameters while preserving the classification accuracy. In the first stage transfer learning, 19 632 augmented regions-of-interest (ROIs) from 2454 mass lesions on mammograms were used to train a pre-trained DCNN on ImageNet. In the second stage transfer learning, the DCNN was used as a feature extractor followed by feature selection and random forest classification. The pathway evolution was performed using genetic algorithm in an iterative approach with tournament selection driven by count-preserving crossover and mutation. The second stage was trained with 9120 DBT ROIs from 228 mass lesions using leave-one-case-out cross-validation. The DCNN was reduced by 87% in the number of neurons, 34% in the number of parameters, and 95% in the number of multiply-and-add operations required in the convolutional layers. The test AUC on 89 mass lesions from 94 independent DBT cases before and after pruning were 0.88 and 0.90, respectively, and the difference was not statistically significant (p  >  0.05). The proposed DCNN compression approach can reduce the number of required operations by 95% while maintaining the classification performance. The approach can be extended to other deep neural networks and imaging tasks where transfer learning is appropriate."
2020,Improving Breast Cancer Detection Accuracy of Mammography with the Concurrent Use of an Artificial Intelligence Tool.,"Purpose To evaluate the benefits of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool for two-dimensional mammography in the breast cancer detection process. Materials and Methods In this multireader, multicase retrospective study, 14 radiologists assessed a dataset of 240 digital mammography images, acquired between 2013 and 2016, using a counterbalance design in which half of the dataset was read without AI and the other half with the help of AI during a first session and vice versa during a second session, which was separated from the first by a washout period. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and reading time were assessed as endpoints. Results The average AUC across readers was 0.769 (95% CI: 0.724, 0.814) without AI and 0.797 (95% CI: 0.754, 0.840) with AI. The average difference in AUC was 0.028 (95% CI: 0.002, 0.055, P = .035). Average sensitivity was increased by 0.033 when using AI support (P = .021). Reading time changed dependently to the AI-tool score. For low likelihood of malignancy (< 2.5%), the time was about the same in the first reading session and slightly decreased in the second reading session. For higher likelihood of malignancy, the reading time was on average increased with the use of AI. Conclusion This clinical investigation demonstrated that the concurrent use of this AI tool improved the diagnostic performance of radiologists in the detection of breast cancer without prolonging their workflow.Supplemental material is available for this article.© RSNA, 2020."
2021,Current Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Subtypes: Dissecting the Most Aggressive Form of Breast Cancer,"Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly heterogeneous disease defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression that lacks targeted treatments, leading to dismal clinical outcomes. Thus, better stratification systems that reflect intrinsic and clinically useful differences between TNBC tumors will sharpen the treatment approaches and improve clinical outcomes. The lack of a rational classification system for TNBC also impacts current and emerging therapeutic alternatives. In the past years, several new methodologies to stratify TNBC have arisen thanks to the implementation of microarray technology, high-throughput sequencing, and bioinformatic methods, exponentially increasing the amount of genomic, epigenomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic information available. Thus, new TNBC subtypes are being characterized with the promise to advance the treatment of this challenging disease. However, the diverse nature of the molecular data, the poor integration between the various methods, and the lack of cost-effective methods for systematic classification have hampered the widespread implementation of these promising developments. However, the advent of artificial intelligence applied to translational oncology promises to bring light into definitive TNBC subtypes. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the available classification strategies. It includes evaluating the overlap between the molecular, immunohistochemical, and clinical characteristics between these approaches and a perspective about the increasing applications of artificial intelligence to identify definitive and clinically relevant TNBC subtypes."
2017,Updated systematic review of exercise studies in breast cancer survivors: attention to the principles of exercise training,"Objectives To update our previous evaluation of the exercise interventions used in randomised controlled trials of breast cancer survivors in relation to (1) the application of the principles of exercise training in the exercise prescription; (2) the reporting of the components of the exercise prescription; and (3) the reporting of adherence of participants to the prescribed interventions. Design Systematic review. Data sources The OVID Medline, Embase, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus electronic databases were searched from January 2010 to January 2017. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials of at least 4 weeks of aerobic and/or resistance exercise in women diagnosed with breast cancer, reporting on physical fitness or body composition outcomes. Results Specificity was appropriately applied by 84%, progression by 29%, overload by 38% and initial values by 67% of newly identified studies. Reversibility was reported by 3% anddiminishing returns by 22% of newly identified studies. No studies reported all components of the exercise prescription in the methods, or adherence to the prescribed intervention in the results. Reporting of reversibility has increased from 2010, but no other improvements in reporting were noted from the previous review. Summary/Conclusion No studies of exercise in women with breast cancer attended to all principles of exercise training, or reported all components of the exercise prescription in the methods, or adherence to the prescription in the results. Full reporting of the exercise prescribed and completed is essential for study replication in research and translating research findings into the community, and should be prioritised in future trials."
2018,Prediction of breast cancer risk using a machine learning approach embedded with a locality preserving projection algorithm,"In order to automatically identify a set of effective mammographic image features and build an optimal breast cancer risk stratification model, this study aims to investigate advantages of applying a machine learning approach embedded with a locally preserving projection (LPP) based feature combination and regeneration algorithm to predict short-term breast cancer risk. A dataset involving negative mammograms acquired from 500 women was assembled. This dataset was divided into two age-matched classes of 250 high risk cases in which cancer was detected in the next subsequent mammography screening and 250 low risk cases, which remained negative. First, a computer-aided image processing scheme was applied to segment fibro-glandular tissue depicted on mammograms and initially compute 44 features related to the bilateral asymmetry of mammographic tissue density distribution between left and right breasts. Next, a multi-feature fusion based machine learning classifier was built to predict the risk of cancer detection in the next mammography screening. A leave-one-case-out (LOCO) cross-validation method was applied to train and test the machine learning classifier embedded with a LLP algorithm, which generated a new operational vector with 4 features using a maximal variance approach in each LOCO process. Results showed a 9.7% increase in risk prediction accuracy when using this LPP-embedded machine learning approach. An increased trend of adjusted odds ratios was also detected in which odds ratios increased from 1.0 to 11.2. This study demonstrated that applying the LPP algorithm effectively reduced feature dimensionality, and yielded higher and potentially more robust performance in predicting short-term breast cancer risk."
2019,Radiomics Analysis of Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging for the Prediction of Sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer,"Purpose: To investigate whether a combination of radiomics and automatic machine learning applied to dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) of primary breast cancer can non-invasively predict axillary sentinel lymph node (SLN) metastasis. Methods: 62 patients who received a DCE-MRI breast scan were enrolled. Tumor resection and sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy were performed within 1 week after the DCE-MRI examination. According to the time signal intensity curve, the volumes of interest (VOIs) were delineated on the whole tumor in the images with the strongest enhanced phase. Datasets were randomly divided into two sets including a training set (~80%) and a validation set (~20%). A total of 1,409 quantitative imaging features were extracted from each VOI. The select K best and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) were used to obtain the optimal features. Three classification models based on the logistic regression (LR), XGboost, and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were constructed. Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) analysis was used to analyze the prediction performance of the models. Both feature selection and models construction were firstly performed in the training set, then were further tested in the validation set by the same thresholds. Results: There is no significant difference between all clinical and pathological variables in breast cancer patients with and without SLN metastasis (P > 0.05), except histological grade (P = 0.03). Six features were obtained as optimal features for models construction. In the validation set, with respect to the accuracy and MSE, the SVM demonstrated the highest performance, with an accuracy, AUC, sensitivity (for positive SLN), specificity (for positive SLN) and Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.85, 0.83, 0.71, 1, 0.26, respectively. Conclusions: We demonstrated the feasibility of combining artificial intelligence and radiomics from DCE-MRI of primary tumors to predict axillary SLN metastasis in breast cancer. This non-invasive approach could be very promising in application."
2019,Fast ScanNet: Fast and Dense Analysis of Multi-Gigapixel Whole-Slide Images for Cancer Metastasis Detection,"Lymph node metastasis is one of the most important indicators in breast cancer diagnosis, that is traditionally observed under the microscope by pathologists. In recent years, with the dramatic advance of high-throughput scanning and deep learning technology, automatic analysis of histology from whole-slide images has received a wealth of interest in the field of medical image computing, which aims to alleviate pathologists’ workload and simultaneously reduce misdiagnosis rate. However, the automatic detection of lymph node metastases from whole-slide images remains a key challenge because such images are typically very large, where they can often be multiple gigabytes in size. Also, the presence of hard mimics may result in a large number of false positives. In this paper, we propose a novel method with anchor layers for model conversion, which not only leverages the efficiency of fully convolutional architectures to meet the speed requirement in clinical practice but also densely scans the whole-slide image to achieve accurate predictions on both micro- and macro-metastases. Incorporating the strategies of asynchronous sample prefetching and hard negative mining, the network can be effectively trained. The efficacy of our method is corroborated on the benchmark dataset of 2016 Camelyon Grand Challenge. Our method achieved significant improvements in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods on tumor localization accuracy with a much faster speed and even surpassed human performance on both challenge tasks."
2020,Novel Approaches to Screening for Breast Cancer.,"Screening for breast cancer reduces breast cancer-related mortality and earlier detection facilitates less aggressive treatment. Unfortunately, current screening modalities are imperfect, suffering from limited sensitivity and high false-positive rates. Novel techniques in the field of breast imaging may soon play a role in breast cancer screening: digital breast tomosynthesis, contrast material-enhanced spectral mammography, US (automated three-dimensional breast US, transmission tomography, elastography, optoacoustic imaging), MRI (abbreviated and ultrafast, diffusion-weighted imaging), and molecular breast imaging. Artificial intelligence and radiomics have the potential to further improve screening strategies. Furthermore, nonimaging-based screening tests such as liquid biopsy and breathing tests may transform the screening landscape. © RSNA, 2020 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2019,Magnetic Hydrogel with Optimally Adaptive Functions for Breast Cancer Recurrence Prevention,"Engineering biocompatible hydrogels using functional nanoparticles has attracted considerable attention because of their uniquely appealing cooperative effects that can enable multimodality imaging and treatment with improved efficacy against serious diseases. However, the effects of high‐content nanoparticle dopants on the rheological properties of hydrogels frequently lead to an unsatisfactory therapeutic result, which is particularly notable in the design of magnetic hydrogel formulations for cancer therapy. Herein is reported a novel magnetic hydrogel functionalized by ferromagnetic vortex‐domain iron oxide (FVIOs) with optimally adaptive functions for prevention of breast cancer recurrence. The FVIOs can perfectly incorporate into the dynamic hydrogel networks with an extremely low concentration (0.6 mg mL−1), 17 times lower than that of conventional superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles with sufficient heating capacity. Such magnetic hydrogels exhibit high inductive heating and remarkable rheological properties simultaneously. Moreover, the self‐healing, self‐conformal ability, controlled release of loaded doxorubicin, biodegradation, and pH‐responsiveness of the magnetic hydrogel project their efficient sustainable therapeutic ability. In vivo postoperative treatment has further demonstrated the high efficacy of FVIO‐based magnetic hydrogels, as evidenced by the significant suppression of the local tumor recurrences compared to chemotherapy or hyperthermia alone. This unique magnetic hydrogel formulation with optimally adaptive functions shows strong potential in preventing relapses of various cancers."
2014,Approaches For Automated Detection And Classification Of Masses In Mammograms,Breast cancer is one of the most common cancer among women around the world. Several techniques are available for detection of breast cancer. Mammography is one of the most effective tools for early detection. The goal of this research is to increase the diagnostic accuracy of image processing and machine learning techniques for optimum classification between normal and abnormalities in digital mammograms. GLCM texture feature extractions are known to be the most common and powerful techniques for texture analysis. This paper presents an evaluation and comparison of the performance of two different classification methods used to classify the normal and abnormal patterns. The experimental result suggest that Artificial Neural Network is outperformed the other method.
2019,Semi-Supervised Histology Classification using Deep Multiple Instance Learning and Contrastive Predictive Coding,"Convolutional neural networks can be trained to perform histology slide classification using weak annotations with multiple instance learning (MIL). However, given the paucity of labeled histology data, direct application of MIL can easily suffer from overfitting and the network is unable to learn rich feature representations due to the weak supervisory signal. We propose to overcome such limitations with a two-stage semi-supervised approach that combines the power of data-efficient self-supervised feature learning via contrastive predictive coding (CPC) and the interpretability and flexibility of regularized attention-based MIL. We apply our two-stage CPC + MIL semi-supervised pipeline to the binary classification of breast cancer histology images. Across five random splits, we report state-of-the-art performance with a mean validation accuracy of 95% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.968. We further evaluate the quality of features learned via CPC relative to simple transfer learning and show that strong classification performance using CPC features can be efficiently leveraged under the MIL framework even with the feature encoder frozen."
2019,Machine learning and Region Growing for Breast Cancer Segmentation,"One of the main causes of increased mortality among women is breast cancer. The ultrasound scan is the most widely used method for diagnosing geological disease i.e. breast cancer. The first step for identifying the abnormality of the breast cancer (malignant from benign), is the extraction of the region of interest (ROI). In order to achieve this, a new approach to breast ROI extraction is proposed for the purpose of reducing false positive cases (FP). The proposed model was built based on the local pixel information and neural network. It includes two stages namely, training and testing. In the training stage, a trained model was built by extracting the number of batches from both ROI and background. The testing stage involved scanning the image with a fixed size window to detect the ROI from the background. Afterwards, a distance transform was used to identify the ROI and remove non-ROI. Experiments were conducted on the on-data set with 250 ultrasound images (150 benign and 100 malignant) the preliminary results show that the proposed method achieves a success rate of about 95.4% for breast contour extraction. The performance of the proposed solution also has been compared with the existing solutions that have been used to segment different types of images."
2017,Deep Learning Diffuse Optical Tomography,"Diffuse optical tomography (DOT) has been investigated as an alternative imaging modality for breast cancer detection thanks to its excellent contrast to hemoglobin oxidization level. However, due to the complicated non-linear photon scattering physics and ill-posedness, the conventional reconstruction algorithms are sensitive to imaging parameters such as boundary conditions. To address this, here we propose a novel deep learning approach that learns non-linear photon scattering physics and obtains an accurate three dimensional (3D) distribution of optical anomalies. In contrast to the traditional black-box deep learning approaches, our deep network is designed to invert the Lippman-Schwinger integral equation using the recent mathematical theory of deep convolutional framelets. As an example of clinical relevance, we applied the method to our prototype DOT system. We show that our deep neural network, trained with only simulation data, can accurately recover the location of anomalies within biomimetic phantoms and live animals without the use of an exogenous contrast agent."
2016,AggNet : Deep Learning From Crowds for Mitosis Detection in Breast Cancer Histology Images,"The lack of publicly available ground-truth data has been identified as the major challenge for transferring recent developments in deep learning to the biomedical imaging domain. Though crowdsourcing has enabled annotation of large scale databases for real world images, its application for biomedical purposes requires a deeper understanding and hence, more precise definition of the actual annotation task. The fact that expert tasks are being outsourced to non-expert users may lead to noisy annotations introducing disagreement between users. Despite being a valuable resource for learning annotation models from crowdsourcing, conventional machine-learning methods may have difficulties dealing with noisy annotations during training. In this manuscript, we present a new concept for learning from crowds that handle data aggregation directly as part of the learning process of the convolutional neural network (CNN) via additional crowdsourcing layer (AggNet). Besides, we present an experimental study on learning from crowds designed to answer the following questions. 1) Can deep CNN be trained with data collected from crowdsourcing? 2) How to adapt the CNN to train on multiple types of annotation datasets (ground truth and crowd-based)? 3) How does the choice of annotation and aggregation affect the accuracy? Our experimental setup involved Annot8, a self-implemented web-platform based on Crowdflower API realizing image annotation tasks for a publicly available biomedical image database. Our results give valuable insights into the functionality of deep CNN learning from crowd annotations and prove the necessity of data aggregation integration."
2022,A weighted bilinear neural collaborative filtering approach for drug repositioning,"Drug repositioning is an efficient and promising strategy for traditional drug discovery and development. Many research efforts are focused on utilizing deep-learning approaches based on a heterogeneous network for modeling complex drug-disease associations. Similar to traditional latent factor models, which directly factorize drug-disease associations, they assume the neighbors are independent of each other in the network and thus tend to be ineffective to capture localized information. In this study, we propose a novel neighborhood and neighborhood interaction-based neural collaborative filtering approach (called DRWBNCF) to infer novel potential drugs for diseases. Specifically, we first construct three networks, including the known drug-disease association network, the drug-drug similarity and disease-disease similarity networks (using the nearest neighbors). To take the advantage of localized information in the three networks, we then design an integration component by proposing a new weighted bilinear graph convolution operation to integrate the information of the known drug-disease association, the drug's and disease's neighborhood and neighborhood interactions into a unified representation. Lastly, we introduce a prediction component, which utilizes the multi-layer perceptron optimized by the α-balanced focal loss function and graph regularization to model the complex drug-disease associations. Benchmarking comparisons on three datasets verified the effectiveness of DRWBNCF for drug repositioning. Importantly, the unknown drug-disease associations predicted by DRWBNCF were validated against clinical trials and three authoritative databases and we listed several new DRWBNCF-predicted potential drugs for breast cancer (e.g. valrubicin and teniposide) and small cell lung cancer (e.g. valrubicin and cytarabine)."
2018,Triple negative breast cancer – prognostic role of immune-related factors: a systematic review,"Abstract Purpose: Treatment of breast cancer has been increasingly successful in recent years with the advent of HER2-receptor targeted treatment and endocrine treatment. However, the triple negative subgroup of breast cancer (TNBC) (estrogen-, progesterone- and HER2-receptor negative) still lacks targeted treatment options. TNBC is a type of breast cancer that often affects younger women, and generally has a worse prognosis than other types of breast cancer. Recently, the complex role of the immune system in cancer growth, elimination and metastasis has been the object of increased attention. There is hope that a more detailed understanding of the intricate roles of the constituents of the immune system, will hold potential both as prognostic or predictive markers of cancer progression, but also as treatment targets for a wide range of tumors, including TNBC. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of the cellular immune microenvironment in TNBC, and to highlight areas in which TNBC may differ from other types of breast cancer. Material and methods: A search of PubMed was made using the terms ‘triple negative breast cancer’ and ‘tumor infiltrating lymphocytes’, ‘CD8’, ‘CD4’, ‘B cells’, ‘natural killer cells’, ‘macrophages’, myeloid derived suppressor cells’, ‘dendritic cells’, ‘immune check point inhibitor’, ‘CTLA-4’ and ‘PD-L1’. Results: We find that whilst factors such as TILs and certain subgroups of TILs (e.g., CD8 + and regulator T-cells) have been extensively researched, none of these markers are currently applicable to routine clinical practice. Also, TNBC differs from other types of breast cancer with regards to cellular composition of the immune infiltrate and PD-L1 expression, and the prognostic significance of these. Conclusions: Immune-related factors have the potential as both prognostic and predictive biomarkers for new treatments targeting the immune system in breast cancer. However, multivariate analyses, taking other well-known factors into account, are required to determine the true value of these biomarkers. Also, differences between TNBC and other types of breast cancer may have implications for treatment and use of immune-related factors as biomarkers."
2021,BRACS: A Dataset for BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping in H&E Histology Images,"Abstract Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and registers the highest number of deaths for women. Advances in diagnostic activities combined with large-scale screening policies have significantly lowered the mortality rates for breast cancer patients. However, the manual inspection of tissue slides by pathologists is cumbersome, time-consuming and is subject to significant inter- and intra-observer variability. Recently, the advent of whole-slide scanning systems has empowered the rapid digitization of pathology slides and enabled the development of Artificial Intelligence (AI)-assisted digital workflows. However, AI techniques, especially Deep Learning, require a large amount of high-quality annotated data to learn from. Constructing such task-specific datasets poses several challenges, such as data-acquisition level constraints, time-consuming and expensive annotations and anonymization of patient information. In this paper, we introduce the BReAst Carcinoma Subtyping (BRACS) dataset, a large cohort of annotated Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images to advance AI development in the automatic characterization of breast lesions. BRACS contains 547 Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) and 4539 Regions Of Interest (ROIs) extracted from the WSIs. Each WSI and respective ROIs are annotated by the consensus of three board-certified pathologists into different lesion categories. Specifically, BRACS includes three lesion types, i.e., benign, malignant and atypical, which are further subtyped into seven categories. It is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest annotated dataset for breast cancer subtyping both at WSI and ROI levels. Furthermore, by including the understudied atypical lesions, BRACS offers a unique opportunity for leveraging AI to better understand their characteristics. We encourage AI practitioners to develop and evaluate novel algorithms on the BRACS dataset to further breast cancer diagnosis and patient care. Database URL: https://www.bracs.icar.cnr.it/"
2014,Large Intervening Non-Coding RNA HOTAIR Is an Indicator of Poor Prognosis and a Therapeutic Target in Human Cancers,"In the human genome, the fraction of protein-coding genes that are stably transcribed is only up to 2%, with the remaining numerous RNAs having no protein-coding function. These non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have received considerable attention in cancer research in recent years. Breakthroughs have been made in understanding microRNAs and small interfering RNAs, but larger RNAs such as long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) remain an enigma. One lncRNA, HOX antisense intergenic RNA (HOTAIR), has been shown to be dysregulated in many types of cancer, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and hepatoma. HOTAIR functions as a regulatory molecule in a wide variety of biological processes. However, its mechanism of action has not been clearly elucidated. It is widely believed that HOTAIR mediates chromosomal remodeling and coordinates with polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) to regulate gene expression. Further study of HOTAIR-related pathways and the role of HOTAIR in tumorigenesis and tumor progression may identify new treatment targets. In this review, we will focus on the characteristics of HOTAIR, as well as data pertaining to its mechanism and its association with cancers."
2019,A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying Gene Biomarkers Guiding the Treatment of Breast Cancer,"Genomic profiles among different breast cancer survivors who received similar treatment may provide clues about the key biological processes involved in the cells and finding the right treatment. More specifically, such profiling may help personalize the treatment based on the patients’ gene expression. In this paper, we present a hierarchical machine learning system that predicts the 5-year survivability of the patients who underwent though specific therapy; The classes are built on the combination of two parts that are the survivability information and the given therapy. For the survivability information part, it defines whether the patient survives the 5-years interval or deceased. While the therapy part denotes the therapy has been taken during that interval, which includes hormone therapy, radiotherapy, or surgery, which totally forms six classes. The Model classifies one class vs. the rest at each node, which makes the tree-based model creates five nodes. The model is trained using a set of standard classifiers based on a comprehensive study dataset that includes genomic profiles and clinical information of 347 patients. A combination of feature selection methods and a prediction method are applied on each node to identify the genes that can predict the class at that node, the identified genes for each class may serve as potential biomarkers to the class’s treatment for better survivability. The results show that the model identifies the classes with high-performance measurements. An exhaustive analysis based on relevant literature shows that some of the potential biomarkers are strongly related to breast cancer survivability and cancer in general."
2015,Brief cognitive-behavioral and relaxation training interventions for breast cancer: A randomized controlled trial.,"OBJECTIVE Women with breast cancer (BCa) report elevated distress postsurgery. Group-based cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) following surgery improves psychological adaptation, though its key mechanisms remain speculative. This randomized controlled dismantling trial compared 2 interventions featuring elements thought to drive CBSM effects: a 5-week cognitive-behavioral training (CBT) and 5-week relaxation training (RT) versus a 5-week health education (HE) control group. METHOD Women with stage 0-III BCa (N = 183) were randomized to CBT, RT, or HE condition 2-10 weeks postsurgery. Psychosocial measures were collected at baseline (T1) and postintervention (T2). Repeated-measures analyses of variance (ANOVAs) tested whether CBT and RT treatments improved primary measures of psychological adaptation and secondary measures of stress management resource perceptions from pre- to postintervention relative to HE. RESULTS Both CBT and RT groups reported reduced depressive affect. The CBT group reported improved emotional well-being/quality of life and less cancer-specific thought intrusions. The RT group reported improvements on illness-related social disruption. Regarding stress management resources, the CBT group reported increased reliability of social support networks, while the RT group reported increased confidence in relaxation skills. Psychological adaptation and stress management resource constructs were unchanged in the HE control group. CONCLUSIONS Nonmetastatic breast cancer patients participating in 2 forms of brief, 5-week group-based stress management intervention after surgery showed improvements in psychological adaptation and stress management resources compared with an attention-matched control group. Findings provide preliminary support suggesting that using brief group-based stress management interventions may promote adaptation among nonmetastatic breast cancer patients."
2016,Leptin promotes breast cancer cell migration and invasion via IL-18 expression and secretion.,"In recent years, crosstalk between tumor microenvironment and cancer cells have received increasing attention. Accumulating research data suggests that leptin, a key adipokine secreted from adipocytes, plays important roles in breast cancer development. In our study, the effects of leptin on polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) and promotion of the invasiveness of tumor cells were investigated. THP1 cells were used to differentiate M2 polarization macrophages. After stimulated by leptin, we established a co-culture system of tumor cells and macrophages to evaluate the function of leptin-induced macrophages in the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. The gene and protein expressions were analyzed and the underlying mechanisms were evaluated. Moreover, pathological human specimens, and xenografts in nude mice, were detected to strengthen the in vitro results. Leptin elevated the expression of an array of cytokines in TAMs, IL-18 was the most increased, with an activation of the NF-κB/NF-κB1 signalling pathway. Additionally, after treated with leptin, TAMs significantly promoted the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells. However, these effects of leptin were abolished by the co-incubation of Bay11‑7082, a pharmacological NF-κB inhibitor. Leptin also directly stimulated IL-18 expression in breast cancer cells, which, differently, was via the PI3K/AKT-ATF-2 signaling pathway. In vivo studies showed that malignant breast carcinoma exhibited strong higher expression of Leptin, IL-8, and TAMs markers. Xenograft tumor-bearing mouse models showed that leptin significantly increased tumor volume, enhanced lung metastases, and increased expression of IL-8 and TAM markers, which were abolished by depletion of macrophages by clophosome-clodronate liposomes (CCL). Leptin could induce IL-18 expression both in TAMs and breast cancer cells. Leptin-induced IL-18 expression was regulated via NF-κB/NF-κB1 signaling in TAMs, while via PI3K-AKT/ATF-2 signaling in breast cancer cells, which, eventually, lead to invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells."
2018,Concordance Study Between IBM Watson for Oncology and Clinical Practice for Patients with Cancer in China.,"BACKGROUND IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO), which can use natural language processing to evaluate data in structured and unstructured formats, has begun to be used in China. It provides physicians with evidence-based treatment options and ranks them in three categories for treatment decision support. This study was designed to examine the concordance between the treatment recommendation proposed by WFO and actual clinical decisions by oncologists in our cancer center, which would reflect the differences of cancer treatment between China and the U.S. PATIENTS AND METHODS Retrospective data from 362 patients with cancer were ingested into WFO from April 2017 to October 2017. WFO recommendations were provided in three categories: recommended, for consideration, and not recommended. Concordance was analyzed by comparing the treatment decisions proposed by WFO with those of the multidisciplinary tumor board. Concordance was achieved when the oncologists' treatment decisions were in the recommended or for consideration categories in WFO. RESULTS Ovarian cancer showed the highest concordance, which was 96%. Lung cancer and breast cancer obtained a concordance of slightly above 80%. The concordance of rectal cancer was 74%, whereas colon cancer and cervical cancer showed the same concordance of 64%. In particular, the concordance of gastric cancer was very low, only 12%, and 88% of cases were under physicians choice. CONCLUSION Different cancer types showed different concordances, and only gastric cancers were significantly less likely to be concordant. Incidence and pharmaceuticals may be the major cause of discordance. To be comprehensively and rapidly applied in China, WFO needs to accelerate localization. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03400514. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE IBM Watson for Oncology (WFO) has begun to be used in China. In this study, concordance was examined between the treatment recommendation proposed by WFO and clinical decisions for 362 patients in our cancer center, which could reflect the differences of cancer treatment between China and the U.S. Different cancer types showed different concordances, and only gastric cancers were significantly less likely to be concordant. Incidence and pharmaceuticals may be the major causes of discordance. To be comprehensively and rapidly applied in China, WFO needs to accelerate localization. This study may have a significant effect on application of artificial intelligence systems in China."
2016,Predicting Breast Cancer Recurrence Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Background: Recurrence is an important cornerstone in breast cancer behavior, intrinsically related to mortality. In spite of its relevance, it is rarely recorded in the majority of breast cancer datasets, which makes research in its prediction more difficult. Objectives: To evaluate the performance of machine learning techniques applied to the prediction of breast cancer recurrence. Material and Methods: Revision of published works that used machine learning techniques in local and open source databases between 1997 and 2014. Results: The revision showed that it is difficult to obtain a representative dataset for breast cancer recurrence and there is no consensus on the best set of predictors for this disease. High accuracy results are often achieved, yet compromising sensitivity. The missing data and class imbalance problems are rarely addressed and most often the chosen performance metrics are inappropriate for the context. Discussion and Conclusions: Although different techniques have been used, prediction of breast cancer recurrence is still an open problem. The combination of different machine learning techniques, along with the definition of standard predictors for breast cancer recurrence seem to be the main future directions to obtain better results."
2020,Deep Neural Networks With Region-Based Pooling Structures for Mammographic Image Classification,"Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed solid cancers. Mammography is the most commonly used screening technology for detecting breast cancer. Traditional machine learning methods of mammographic image classification or segmentation using manual features require a great quantity of manual segmentation annotation data to train the model and test the results. But manual labeling is expensive, time-consuming, and laborious, and greatly increases the cost of system construction. To reduce this cost and the workload of radiologists, an end-to-end full-image mammogram classification method based on deep neural networks was proposed for classifier building, which can be constructed without bounding boxes or mask ground truth label of training data. The only label required in this method is the classification of mammographic images, which can be relatively easy to collect from diagnostic reports. Because breast lesions usually take up a fraction of the total area visualized in the mammographic image, we propose different pooling structures for convolutional neural networks(CNNs) instead of the common pooling methods, which divide the image into regions and select the few with high probability of malignancy as the representation of the whole mammographic image. The proposed pooling structures can be applied on most CNN-based models, which may greatly improve the models’ performance on mammographic image data with the same input. Experimental results on the publicly available INbreast dataset and CBIS dataset indicate that the proposed pooling structures perform satisfactorily on mammographic image data compared with previous state-of-the-art mammographic image classifiers and detection algorithm using segmentation annotations."
2019,Predicting breast cancer risk using personal health data and machine learning models,"Among women, breast cancer is a leading cause of death. Breast cancer risk predictions can inform screening and preventative actions. Previous works found that adding inputs to the widely-used Gail model improved its ability to predict breast cancer risk. However, these models used simple statistical architectures and the additional inputs were derived from costly and / or invasive procedures. By contrast, we developed machine learning models that used highly accessible personal health data to predict five-year breast cancer risk. We created machine learning models using only the Gail model inputs and models using both Gail model inputs and additional personal health data relevant to breast cancer risk. For both sets of inputs, six machine learning models were trained and evaluated on the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial data set. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve metric quantified each model’s performance. Since this data set has a small percentage of positive breast cancer cases, we also reported sensitivity, specificity, and precision. We used Delong tests (p < 0.05) to compare the testing data set performance of each machine learning model to that of the Breast Cancer Risk Prediction Tool (BCRAT), an implementation of the Gail model. None of the machine learning models with only BCRAT inputs were significantly stronger than the BCRAT. However, the logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, and neural network models with the broader set of inputs were all significantly stronger than the BCRAT. These results suggest that relative to the BCRAT, additional easy-to-obtain personal health inputs can improve five-year breast cancer risk prediction. Our models could be used as non-invasive and cost-effective risk stratification tools to increase early breast cancer detection and prevention, motivating both immediate actions like screening and long-term preventative measures such as hormone replacement therapy and chemoprevention."
2020,Exosomes From Adipose-Derived Stem Cells: The Emerging Roles and Applications in Tissue Regeneration of Plastic and Cosmetic Surgery,"Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are an important stem cell type separated from adipose tissue, with the properties of multilineage differentiation, easy availability, high proliferation potential, and self-renewal. Exosomes are novel frontiers of intercellular communication regulating the biological behaviors of cells, such as angiogenesis, immune modulation, proliferation, and migration. ASC-derived exosomes (ASC-exos) are important components released by ASCs paracrine, possessing multiple biological activities. Tissue regeneration requires coordinated “vital networks” of multiple growth factors, proteases, progenitors, and immune cells producing inflammatory cytokines. Recently, as cell-to-cell messengers, ASC-exos have received much attention for the fact that they are important paracrine mediators contributing to their suitability for tissue regeneration. ASC-exos, with distinct properties by encapsulating various types of bioactive cargoes, are endowed with great application potential in tissue regeneration, mechanically via the migration and proliferation of repair cells, facilitation of the neovascularization, and other specific functions in different tissues. Here, this article elucidated the research progress of ASC-exos about tissue regeneration in plastic and cosmetic surgery, including skin anti-aging therapy, dermatitis improvement, wound healing, scar removal, flap transplantation, bone tissue repair and regeneration, obesity prevention, fat grafting, breast cancer, and breast reconstruction. Deciphering the biological properties of ASC-exos will provide further insights for exploring novel therapeutic strategies of tissue regeneration in plastic and cosmetic surgery."
2022,Photo-Reduction with NIR Light of Nucleus Targeting Pt(IV) Nanoparticles for Combined Tumor-Targeted Chemotherapy and Photodynamic Immunotherapy.,"The development of Pt(IV) prodrugs which are selectively reduced within cancerous cells into their Pt(II) therapeutically active species has received increasing attention within the last decade. Despite recent research progress, the majority of investigated compounds are excited using ultraviolet or blue light. As the light penetration depth is low at these wavelengths, the treatment of deep-seated or large tumors is limited. To overcome this limitation, herein, the first example of Pt(IV) functionalized nanoparticles that could be excited within the NIR region at 808 nm is reported. The polymer backbone which can self-assemble into nanoparticles was functionalized with Pt(IV) complexes for chemotherapy, photosensitizers for photodynamic immunotherapy, and nucleus/cancer-targeting peptides. Upon irradiation, the Pt(IV) center is reduced to Pt(II) and the axially coordinated ligands are released, presenting a multimodal treatment. While selectively accumulating in tumorous tissue, the nanoparticles demonstrated to eradicate a triple-negative breast cancer tumor inside a mouse model."
2018,Development of a Deep-Learning-Based Method for Breast Ultrasound Image Segmentation,"Breast cancer is one of the deadliest cancers that cause women death globally. Ultrasound imaging is one of the commonly used diagnostic tools for detection and classification of breast abnormalities. In the past decades, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to improve the accuracy of diagnosis made by radiologists. In particular, automatic breast ultrasound (BUS) image segmentation is a critical step for cancer diagnosis using CAD. However, accurate tumor segmentation is still a challenge as a result of various ultrasound artifacts. This paper developed a novel segmentation framework based on deep learning architecture u-net, for breast ultrasound imaging. U-net is a convolutional neural network architecture designed for biology image segmentation with limited training data. It was originally proposed for neuronal structure segmentation in microscopy images. In our work, we modified and improved the method for BUS image segmentation. On a database of 221 BUS images, we first applied pre-processing techniques including contrast enhancement and speckle reduction to improve the image quality. Then the u-net model was trained and tested through two-fold cross-validation. In order to increase the size of training set, data augmentation strategies including rotation and elastic deformation were applied. Finally, a post-processing step that removed noisy region(s) from the segmentation result finalized the whole method. The area error metrics, dice coefficient, and similarity rate were calculated to evaluate the performance on the testing sets. We compared our method with another two fully automatic segmentation methods on the same dataset. Our method outperformed the other two significantly with the dice coefficient = 0.825 and similarity rate = 0.698. Experiment results showed that the modified u-net method is more robust and accurate in breast tumor segmentation for ultrasound images."
2017,Allosteric Inhibitors of SHP2 with Therapeutic Potential for Cancer Treatment.,"SHP2, a cytoplasmic protein-tyrosine phosphatase encoded by the PTPN11 gene, is involved in multiple cell signaling processes including Ras/MAPK and Hippo/YAP pathways. SHP2 has been shown to contribute to the progression of a number of cancer types including leukemia, gastric, and breast cancers. It also regulates T-cell activation by interacting with inhibitory immune checkpoint receptors such as the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and B- and T-lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA). Thus, SHP2 inhibitors have drawn great attention by both inhibiting tumor cell proliferation and activating T cell immune responses toward cancer cells. In this study, we report the identification of an allosteric SHP2 inhibitor 1-(4-(6-bromonaphthalen-2-yl)thiazol-2-yl)-4-methylpiperidin-4-amine (23) that locks SHP2 in a closed conformation by binding to the interface of the N-terminal SH2, C-terminal SH2, and phosphatase domains. Compound 23 suppresses MAPK signaling pathway and YAP transcriptional activity and shows antitumor activity in vivo. The results indicate that allosteric inhibition of SHP2 could be a feasible approach for cancer therapy."
2018,Evaluating the Performance of Machine Learning Techniques in the Classification of Wisconsin Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is a considerable problem among the women and causes death around the world. This disease can be detected by distinguishing malignant and benign tumors. Hence, doctors require trustworthy diagnosing process in order to differentiate between malignant and benign tumors. Therefore, the automation of this process is required to recognize tumors. Numerous research works have tried to apply the algorithms of machine learning for classifying breast cancer and it was proven by many researchers that machine learning algorithms act preferable in the diagnosing process. In this paper, three machine-learning algorithms (Support Vector Machine, K-nearest neighbors, and Decision tree) have been used and the performance of these classifiers has been compared in order to detect which classifier works better in the classification of breast cancer. Furthermore, the dataset of Â Â Wisconsin Breast Cancer (Diagnostic) has been used in this study. The main aim of this work is to make comparison among several classifiers and find the best classifier which gives better accuracy. The outcomes of this study have revealed that quadratic support vector machine grants the largest accuracy of (98.1%) with lowest false discovery rates. The experiments of this study have been carried out and managed in Matlab which has a special toolbox for machine learning algorithms.Â Â Â "
2019,MRI Breast Tumor Segmentation Using Different Encoder and Decoder CNN Architectures,"Breast tumor segmentation in medical images is a decisive step for diagnosis and treatment follow-up. Automating this challenging task helps radiologists to reduce the high manual workload of breast cancer analysis. In this paper, we propose two deep learning approaches to automate the breast tumor segmentation in dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) by building two fully convolutional neural networks (CNN) based on SegNet and U-Net. The obtained models can handle both detection and segmentation on each single DCE-MRI slice. In this study, we used a dataset of 86 DCE-MRIs, acquired before and after two cycles of chemotherapy, of 43 patients with local advanced breast cancer, a total of 5452 slices were used to train and validate the proposed models. The data were annotated manually by an experienced radiologist. To reduce the training time, a high-performance architecture composed of graphic processing units was used. The model was trained and validated, respectively, on 85% and 15% of the data. A mean intersection over union (IoU) of 68.88 was achieved using SegNet and 76.14% using U-Net architecture."
2018,Artificial intelligence methods for the diagnosis of breast cancer by image processing: a review,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women around the world. Despite enormous medical progress, breast cancer has still remained the second leading cause of death worldwide; thus, its early diagnosis has a significant impact on reducing mortality. However, it is often difficult to diagnose breast abnormalities. Different tools such as mammography, ultrasound, and thermography have been developed to screen breast cancer. In this way, the computer helps radiologists identify chest abnormalities more efficiently using image processing and artificial intelligence (AI) tools. This article examined various methods of AI using image processing to diagnose breast cancer. It was a review study through library and Internet searches. By searching the databases such as Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE) via PubMed, Springer, IEEE, ScienceDirect, and Gray Literature (including Google Scholar, articles published in conferences, government technical reports, and other materials not controlled by scientific publishers) and searching for breast cancer keywords, AI and medical image processing techniques were extracted. The results were provided in tables to demonstrate different techniques and their results over recent years. In this study, 18,651 articles were extracted from 2007 to 2017. Among them, those that used similar techniques and reported similar results were excluded and 40 articles were finally examined. Since each of the articles used image processing, a list of features related to the image used in each article was also provided. The results showed that support vector machines had the highest accuracy percentage for different types of images (ultrasound =95.85%, mammography =93.069%, thermography =100%). Computerized diagnosis of breast cancer has greatly contributed to the development of medicine, is constantly being used by radiologists, and is clear in ethical and medical fields with regard to its effects. Computer-assisted methods increase diagnosis accuracy by reducing false positives."
2021,Vision Transformer for Classification of Breast Ultrasound Images,"Medical ultrasound (US) imaging has become a prominent modality for breast cancer imaging due to its ease-of-use, low-cost and safety. In the past decade, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as the method of choice in vision applications and have shown excellent potential in automatic classification of US images. Despite their success, their restricted local receptive field limits their ability to learn global context information. Recently, Vision Transformer (ViT) designs that are based on self-attention between image patches have shown great potential to be an alternative to CNNs. In this study, for the first time, we utilize ViT to classify breast US images using different augmentation strategies. The results are provided as classification accuracy and Area Under the Curve (AUC) metrics, and the performance is compared with the state-of-the-art CNNs. The results indicate that the ViT models have comparable efficiency with or even better than the CNNs in classification of US breast images."
2021,BCD-WERT: a novel approach for breast cancer detection using whale optimization based efficient features and extremely randomized tree algorithm,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in the current age. It often results in subpar living conditions for a patient as they have to go through expensive and painful treatments to fight this cancer. One in eight women all over the world is affected by this disease. Almost half a million women annually do not survive this fight and die from this disease. Machine learning algorithms have proven to outperform all existing solutions for the prediction of breast cancer using models built on the previously available data. In this paper, a novel approach named BCD-WERT is proposed that utilizes the Extremely Randomized Tree and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) for efficient feature selection and classification. WOA reduces the dimensionality of the dataset and extracts the relevant features for accurate classification. Experimental results on state-of-the-art comprehensive dataset demonstrated improved performance in comparison with eight other machine learning algorithms: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Kernel Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Gaussian Naive Bayes and k-Nearest Neighbor. BCD-WERT outperformed all with the highest accuracy rate of 99.30% followed by SVM achieving 98.60% accuracy. Experimental results also reveal the effectiveness of feature selection techniques in improving prediction accuracy."
2020,Performance Evaluation of a Proposed Machine Learning Model for Chronic Disease Datasets Using an Integrated Attribute Evaluator and an Improved Decision Tree Classifier,"There is a consistent rise in chronic diseases worldwide. These diseases decrease immunity and the quality of daily life. The treatment of these disorders is a challenging task for medical professionals. Dimensionality reduction techniques make it possible to handle big data samples, providing decision support in relation to chronic diseases. These datasets contain a series of symptoms that are used in disease prediction. The presence of redundant and irrelevant symptoms in the datasets should be identified and removed using feature selection techniques to improve classification accuracy. Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is a comparative analysis of the impact of wrapper and filter selection methods on classification performance. The filter methods that have been considered include the Correlation Feature Selection (CFS) method, the Information Gain (IG) method and the Chi-Square (CS) method. The wrapper methods that have been considered include the Best First Search (BFS) method, the Linear Forward Selection (LFS) method and the Greedy Step Wise Search (GSS) method. A Decision Tree algorithm has been used as a classifier for this analysis and is implemented through the WEKA tool. An attribute significance analysis has been performed on the diabetes, breast cancer and heart disease datasets used in the study. It was observed that the CFS method outperformed other filter methods concerning the accuracy rate and execution time. The accuracy rate using the CFS method on the datasets for heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer was 93.8%, 89.5% and 96.8% respectively. Moreover, latency delays of 1.08 s, 1.02 s and 1.01 s were noted using the same method for the respective datasets. Among wrapper methods, BFS’ performance was impressive in comparison to other methods. Maximum accuracy of 94.7%, 95.8% and 96.8% were achieved on the datasets for heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer respectively. Latency delays of 1.42 s, 1.44 s and 132 s were recorded using the same method for the respective datasets. On the basis of the obtained result, a new hybrid Attribute Evaluator method has been proposed which effectively integrates enhanced K-Means clustering with the CFS filter method and the BFS wrapper method. Furthermore, the hybrid method was evaluated with an improved decision tree classifier. The improved decision tree classifier combined clustering with classification. It was validated on 14 different chronic disease datasets and its performance was recorded. A very optimal and consistent classification performance was observed. The mean values for accuracy, specificity, sensitivity and f-score metrics were 96.7%, 96.5%, 95.6% and 96.2% respectively."
2019,Artificial intelligence in breast ultrasound,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is gaining extensive attention for its excellent performance in image-recognition tasks and increasingly applied in breast ultrasound. AI can conduct a quantitative assessment by recognizing imaging information automatically and make more accurate and reproductive imaging diagnosis. Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, severely threatening women’s health, the early screening of which is closely related to the prognosis of patients. Therefore, utilization of AI in breast cancer screening and detection is of great significance, which can not only save time for radiologists, but also make up for experience and skill deficiency on some beginners. This article illustrates the basic technical knowledge regarding AI in breast ultrasound, including early machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms, and their application in the differential diagnosis of benign and malignant masses. At last, we talk about the future perspectives of AI in breast ultrasound."
2020,Breast cancer‐derived exosomes: Tumor progression and therapeutic agents,"Tumor cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs) for intercellular communication. EVs by transporting different proteins, nucleic acids, and lipids contribute to affect target cell function and fate. ‎EVs which originate directly from multivesicular bodies so‐called exosomes have dramatically fascinated the attention of researchers owing to their ‎pivotal roles in the tumorigenesis. Breast cancer, arising from milk‐producing cells, is the most identified cancer among women and has become the leading cause of cancer‐related death in women globally. Although different therapies are applied to eliminate breast tumor cells, however, the efficient therapy and survival rate of patients remain challenges. Growing evidence ‎shows exosomes from breast cancer cells contribute to proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, chemoresistance, and also radioresistance and, thus carcinogenesis. Additionally, these exosomes may serve as a cancer treatment tool because they are a good candidate for cancer diagnosis (as biomarker) and therapy (as drug‐carrier). Despite recent development in the biology of tumor‐derived exosomes, the detailed mechanism of tumorigenesis, and exosome‐based cancer‐therapy remain still indefinable. Here, we discuss the key function of breast cancer‐derived exosomes in tumorgenesis and shed light on the possible clinical application of these exosomes in breast cancer treatment."
2021,RETRACTED: Mixed-mode database miner classifier: Parallel computation of graphical processing unit mining,"Graphical processing unit (GPU) has gained more popularity among researchers in the field of decision making and knowledge discovery systems. However, most of the earlier studies have GPU memory utilization, computational time, and accuracy limitations. The main contribution of this paper is to present a novel algorithm called the Mixed Mode Database Miner (MMDBM) classifier by implementing multithreading concepts on a large number of attributes. The proposed method use the quick sort algorithm in GPU parallel computing to overcome the state of the art limitations. This method applies the dynamic rule generation approach for constructing the decision tree based on the predicted rules. Moreover, the implementation results are compared with both SLIQ and MMDBM using Java and GPU with the computed acceleration ratio time using the BP dataset. The primary objective of this work is to improve the performance with less processing time. The results are also analyzed using various threads in GPU mining using eight different datasets of UCI Machine learning repository. The proposed MMDBM algorithm have been validated on these chosen eight different dataset with accuracy of 91.3% in diabetes, 89.1% in breast cancer, 96.6% in iris, 89.9% in labor, 95.4% in vote, 89.5% in credit card, 78.7% in supermarket and 78.7% in BP, and simultaneously, it also takes less computational time for given datasets. The outcome of this work will be beneficial for the research community to develop more effective multi thread based GPU solution in GPU mining to handle large set of data in minimal processing time. Therefore, this can be considered a more reliable and precise method for GPU computing."
2020,Feature article: A generative adversarial network for artifact removal in photoacoustic computed tomography with a linear-array transducer,"With balanced spatial resolution, penetration depth, and imaging speed, photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is promising for clinical translation such as in breast cancer screening, functional brain imaging, and surgical guidance. Typically using a linear ultrasound (US) transducer array, PACT has great flexibility for hand-held applications. However, the linear US transducer array has a limited detection angle range and frequency bandwidth, resulting in limited-view and limited-bandwidth artifacts in the reconstructed PACT images. These artifacts significantly reduce the imaging quality. To address these issues, existing solutions often have to pay the price of system complexity, cost, and/or imaging speed. Here, we propose a deep-learning-based method that explores the Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) to reduce the limited-view and limited-bandwidth artifacts in PACT. Compared with existing reconstruction and convolutional neural network approach, our model has shown improvement in imaging quality and resolution. Our results on simulation, phantom, and in vivo data have collectively demonstrated the feasibility of applying WGAN-GP to improve PACT’s image quality without any modification to the current imaging set-up. Impact statement This study has the following main impacts. It offers a promising solution for removing limited-view and limited-bandwidth artifact in PACT using a linear-array transducer and conventional image reconstruction, which have long hindered its clinical translation. Our solution shows unprecedented artifact removal ability for in vivo image, which may enable important applications such as imaging tumor angiogenesis and hypoxia. The study reports, for the first time, the use of an advanced deep-learning model based on stabilized generative adversarial network. Our results have demonstrated its superiority over other state-of-the-art deep-learning methods."
2022,TTCNN: A Breast Cancer Detection and Classification towards Computer-Aided Diagnosis Using Digital Mammography in Early Stages,"Breast cancer is a major research area in the medical image analysis field; it is a dangerous disease and a major cause of death among women. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer based on digital mammograms can enhance disease detection accuracy. Medical imagery must be detected, segmented, and classified for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems to help the radiologists for accurate diagnosis of breast lesions. Therefore, an accurate breast cancer detection and classification approach is proposed for screening of mammograms. In this paper, we present a deep learning system that can identify breast cancer in mammogram screening images using an “end-to-end” training strategy that efficiently uses mammography images for computer-aided breast cancer recognition in the early stages. First, the proposed approach implements the modified contrast enhancement method in order to refine the detail of edges from the source mammogram images. Next, the transferable texture convolutional neural network (TTCNN) is presented to enhance the performance of classification and the energy layer is integrated in this work to extract the texture features from the convolutional layer. The proposed approach consists of only three layers of convolution and one energy layer, rather than the pooling layer. In the third stage, we analyzed the performance of TTCNN based on deep features of convolutional neural network models (InceptionResNet-V2, Inception-V3, VGG-16, VGG-19, GoogLeNet, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, and ResNet-101). The deep features are extracted by determining the best layers which enhance the classification accuracy. In the fourth stage, by using the convolutional sparse image decomposition approach, all the extracted feature vectors are fused and, finally, the best features are selected by using the entropy controlled firefly method. The proposed approach employed on DDSM, INbreast, and MIAS datasets and attained the average accuracy of 97.49%. Our proposed transferable texture CNN-based method for classifying screening mammograms has outperformed prior methods. These findings demonstrate that automatic deep learning algorithms can be easily trained to achieve high accuracy in diverse mammography images, and can offer great potential to improve clinical tools to minimize false positive and false negative screening mammography results."
2018,The “Yin and Yang” of Natural Compounds in Anticancer Therapy of Triple-Negative Breast Cancers,"Among the different types of breast cancers, triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are highly aggressive, do not respond to conventional hormonal/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-targeted interventions due to the lack of the respective receptor targets, have chances of early recurrence, metastasize, tend to be more invasive in nature, and develop drug resistance. The global burden of TNBCs is increasing regardless of the number of cytotoxic drugs being introduced into the market each year as they have only moderate efficacy and/or unforeseen side effects. Therefore, the demand for more efficient therapeutic interventions, with reduced side effects, for the treatment of TNBCs is rising. While some plant metabolites/derivatives actually induce the risk of cancers, many plant-derived active principles have gained attention as efficient anticancer agents against TNBCs, with fewer adverse side effects. Here we discuss the possible oncogenic molecular pathways in TNBCs and how the purified plant-derived natural compounds specifically target and modulate the genes and/or proteins involved in these aberrant pathways to exhibit their anticancer potential. We have linked the anticancer potential of plant-derived natural compounds (luteolin, chalcones, piperine, deguelin, quercetin, rutin, fisetin, curcumin, resveratrol, and others) to their ability to target multiple dysregulated signaling pathways (such as the Wnt/β-catenin, Notch, NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and Hedgehog) leading to suppression of cell growth, proliferation, migration, inflammation, angiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and metastasis, and activation of apoptosis in TNBCs. Plant-derived compounds in combination with classical chemotherapeutic agents were more efficient in the treatment of TNBCs, possibly with lesser side effects."
2017,A Review of Denoising Medical Images Using Machine Learning Approaches,"Background: This paper attempts to identify suitable Machine Learning (ML) approach for image denoising of radiology based medical application. The Identification of ML approach is based on (i) Review of ML approach for denoising (ii) Review of suitable Medical Denoising approach. Discussion: The review focuses on six application of radiology: Medical Ultrasound (US) for fetus development, US Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) and detection for breast, skin lesions, brain tumor MRI diagnosis, X-Ray for chest analysis, Breast cancer using MRI imaging. This survey identifies the ML approach with better accuracy for medical diagnosis by radiologists. The image denoising approaches further includes basic filtering techniques, wavelet medical denoising, curvelet and optimization techniques. In most of the applications, the machine learning performance is better than the conventional image denoising techniques. For fast and computational results the radiologists are using the machine learning methods on MRI, US, X-Ray and Skin lesion images. The characteristics and contributions of different ML approaches are considered in this paper. Conclusion: The problem faced by the researchers during image denoising techniques and machine learning applications for clinical settings have also been discussed."
2022,An Artificial Intelligence-based Mammography Screening Protocol for Breast Cancer: Outcome and Radiologist Workload.,"Background Developments in artificial intelligence (AI) systems to assist radiologists in reading mammograms could improve breast cancer screening efficiency. Purpose To investigate whether an AI system could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a screening sample to safely reduce radiologist workload and evaluate across Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) densities. Materials and Methods This retrospective simulation study analyzed mammographic examination data consecutively collected from January 2014 to December 2015 in the Danish Capital Region breast cancer screening program. All mammograms were scored from 0 to 10, representing the risk of malignancy, using an AI tool. During simulation, normal mammograms (score < 5) would be excluded from radiologist reading and suspicious mammograms (score > recall threshold [RT]) would be recalled. Two radiologists read the remaining mammograms. The RT was fitted using another independent cohort (same institution) by matching to the radiologist sensitivity. This protocol was further applied to each BI-RADS density. Screening outcomes were measured using the sensitivity, specificity, workload, and false-positive rate. The AI-based screening was tested for noninferiority sensitivity compared with radiologist screening using the Farrington-Manning test. Specificities were compared using the McNemar test. Results The study sample comprised 114 421 screenings for breast cancer in 114 421 women, resulting in 791 screen-detected, 327 interval, and 1473 long-term cancers and 2107 false-positive screenings. The mean age of the women was 59 years ± 6 (SD). The AI-based screening sensitivity was 69.7% (779 of 1118; 95% CI: 66.9, 72.4) and was noninferior (P = .02) to the radiologist screening sensitivity of 70.8% (791 of 1118; 95% CI: 68.0, 73.5). The AI-based screening specificity was 98.6% (111 725 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.5, 98.7), which was higher (P < .001) than the radiologist specificity of 98.1% (111 196 of 113 303; 95% CI: 98.1, 98.2). The radiologist workload was reduced by 62.6% (71 585 of 114 421), and 25.1% (529 of 2107) of false-positive screenings were avoided. Screening results were consistent across BI-RADS densities, although not significantly so for sensitivity. Conclusion Artificial intelligence (AI)-based screening could detect normal, moderate-risk, and suspicious mammograms in a breast cancer screening program, which may reduce the radiologist workload. AI-based screening performed consistently across breast densities. © RSNA, 2022 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2015,Efficacy of a Web-Based Intelligent Tutoring System for Communicating Genetic Risk of Breast Cancer,"Background. Many healthy women consider genetic testing for breast cancer risk, yet BRCA testing issues are complex. Objective. To determine whether an intelligent tutor, BRCA Gist, grounded in fuzzy-trace theory (FTT), increases gist comprehension and knowledge about genetic testing for breast cancer risk, improving decision making. Design. In 2 experiments, 410 healthy undergraduate women were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups: an online module using a Web-based tutoring system (BRCA Gist) that uses artificial intelligence technology, a second group read highly similar content from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Web site, and a third that completed an unrelated tutorial. Intervention. BRCA Gist applied FTT and was designed to help participants develop gist comprehension of topics relevant to decisions about BRCA genetic testing, including how breast cancer spreads, inherited genetic mutations, and base rates. Measures. We measured content knowledge, gist comprehension of decision-relevant information, interest in testing, and genetic risk and testing judgments. Results. Control knowledge scores ranged from 54% to 56%, NCI improved significantly to 65% and 70%, and BRCA Gist improved significantly more to 75% and 77%, P < 0.0001. BRCA Gist scored higher on gist comprehension than NCI and control, P < 0.0001. Control genetic risk-assessment mean was 48% correct; BRCA Gist (61%) and NCI (56%) were significantly higher, P < 0.0001. BRCA Gist participants recommended less testing for women without risk factors (not good candidates; 24% and 19%) than controls (50%, both experiments) and NCI (32%), experiment 2, P < 0.0001. BRCA Gist testing interest was lower than in controls, P < 0.0001. Limitations. BRCA Gist has not been tested with older women from diverse groups. Conclusions. Intelligent tutors, such as BRCA Gist, are scalable, cost-effective ways of helping people understand complex issues, improving decision making."
2015,Breast density: clinical implications and assessment methods.,"Breast density assessment is an important component of the screening mammography report and conveys information to referring clinicians about mammographic sensitivity and the relative risk for developing breast cancer. These topics have gained substantial attention because of recent legislation in several states that requires patients to be informed of dense breast tissue and the potential for associated breast cancer risk and decreased mammographic sensitivity. Because of the considerable implications of diagnosing a woman with dense breast tissue, radiologists should strive to be as consistent as possible when assessing breast density. Commonly used methods of breast density assessment range from subjective visual estimation to quantitative calculations of area and volume density percentages made with complex computer algorithms. The basic principles of currently available commercial methods of calculating fibroglandular density are described and illustrated. There is no criterion standard for determining breast density, but understanding the pros and cons of the various assessment methods will allow radiologists to make informed decisions. Radiologists should understand the basic factors involved in breast density assessment, the changes related to density assessment described in the fifth edition of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) lexicon, and the capabilities of currently available software. Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2017,Characterization of Symbolic Rules Embedded in Deep DIMLP Networks: A Challenge to Transparency of Deep Learning,"Abstract Rule extraction from neural networks is a fervent research topic. In the last 20 years many authors presented a number of techniques showing how to extract symbolic rules from Multi Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Nevertheless, very few were related to ensembles of neural networks and even less for networks trained by deep learning. On several datasets we performed rule extraction from ensembles of Discretized Interpretable Multi Layer Perceptrons (DIMLP), and DIMLPs trained by deep learning. The results obtained on the Thyroid dataset and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset show that the predictive accuracy of the extracted rules compare very favorably with respect to state of the art results. Finally, in the last classification problem on digit recognition, generated rules from the MNIST dataset can be viewed as discriminatory features in particular digit areas. Qualitatively, with respect to rule complexity in terms of number of generated rules and number of antecedents per rule, deep DIMLPs and DIMLPs trained by arcing give similar results on a binary classification problem involving digits 5 and 8. On the whole MNIST problem we showed that it is possible to determine the feature detectors created by neural networks and also that the complexity of the extracted rulesets can be well balanced between accuracy and interpretability."
2018,Long non-coding RNAs AC026904.1 and UCA1: a “one-two punch” for TGF-β-induced SNAI2 activation and epithelial-mesenchymal transition in breast cancer,"Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) has received much attention as a major inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) during cancer progression, mainly by activating a set of pleiotropic transcription factors including SNAI2/Slug. However, the involvement of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in TGF-β-induced Slug activation and EMT remains largely unknown. Methods: In this study, we used microarray analysis to compare lncRNA expression profiles between TGF-β treated and untreated breast cancer cells. Then, the clinical significance of lncRNAs in breast cancer was investigated by qPCR and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The molecular mechanisms and EMT-promoting effects in vitro were analyzed by confocal laser microscopy, Western blotting, chromosome conformation capture (3C), chromatin isolation by RNA purification (ChIRP), ChIP, luciferase reporter assay and transwell migration assay. Lastly, the pro-metastatic effects in vivo were evaluated by bioluminescent imaging and hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Results: We observed that TGF-β induced genome-wide changes in lncRNA levels in breast cancer cells, among which AC026904.1 and UCA1 were highly expressed in metastatic breast cancer and closely associated with poor prognosis. Mechanistic study revealed that AC026904.1 and UCA1 were upregulated by non-canonical and canonical TGF-β pathways, respectively. Further analysis showed that AC026904.1 functions as an enhancer RNA in the nucleus, whereas UCA1 exerts a competitive endogenous RNA (ceRNA) activity in the cytoplasm. In addition, the biological functions of these two lncRNAs converged on the activation and maintenance of Slug, constituting a one-two punch in promoting EMT and tumor metastasis. Conclusion: These findings uncover for the first time that AC026904.1 and UCA1 could cooperatively upregulate Slug expression at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels, exerting critical roles in TGF-β-induced EMT. The present work provides new evidence that lncRNAs function as key regulators of EMT and hold great promise to be used as novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for metastatic breast cancer."
2020,Optimizing Survival Analysis of XGBoost for Ties to Predict Disease Progression of Breast Cancer,"Objective: Some excellent prognostic models based on survival analysis methods for breast cancer have been proposed and extensively validated, which provide an essential means for clinical diagnosis and treatment to improve patient survival. To analyze clinical and follow-up data of 12119 breast cancer patients, derived from the Clinical Research Center for Breast (CRCB) in West China Hospital of Sichuan University, we developed a gradient boosting algorithm, called EXSA, by optimizing survival analysis of XGBoost framework for ties to predict the disease progression of breast cancer. Methods: EXSA is based on the XGBoost framework in machine learning and the Cox proportional hazards model in survival analysis. By taking Efron approximation of partial likelihood function as a learning objective for ties, EXSA derives gradient formulas of a more precise approximation. It optimizes and enhances the ability of XGBoost for survival data with ties. After retaining 4575 patients (3202 cases for training, 1373 cases for test), we exploit the developed EXSA method to build an excellent prognostic model to estimate disease progress. Risk score of disease progress is evaluated by the model, and the risk grouping and continuous functions between risk scores and disease progress rate at 5- and 10-year are also demonstrated. Results: Experimental results on test set show that the EXSA method achieves competitive performance with concordance index of 0.83454, 5-year and 10-year AUC of 0.83851 and 0.78155, respectively. Conclusion: The proposed EXSA method can be utilized as an effective method for survival analysis. Significance: The proposed method in this paper can provide an important means for follow-up data of breast cancer or other disease research."
2014,Help Seeking Behavior of Women with Self-Discovered Breast Cancer Symptoms: A Meta-Ethnographic Synthesis of Patient Delay,"Background and Objective Patient delay makes a critical contribution to late diagnosis and poor survival in cases of breast cancer. Identifying the factors that influence patient delay could provide information for adopting strategies that shorten this delay. The aim of this meta-ethnography was to synthesize existing qualitative evidence in order to gain a new understanding of help seeking behavior in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and to determine the factors that influence patient delay. Methods The design was a meta-ethnography approach. A systematic search of the articles was performed in different databases including Elsevier, PubMed, ProQuest and SCOPUS. Qualitative studies with a focus on help seeking behaviors in women with self-discovered breast cancer symptoms and patient delay, published in the English language between 1990 and 2013 were included. The quality appraisal of the articles was carried out using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme qualitative research checklist and 13 articles met the inclusion criteria. The synthesis was conducted according to Noblit and Hare’s meta-ethnographic approach (1988), through reciprocal translational analysis and lines-of-argument. Findings The synthesis led to identification of eight repeated key concepts including: symptom detection, initial symptom interpretation, symptom monitoring, social interaction, emotional reaction, priority of medical help, appraisal of health services and personal-environmental factors. Symptom interpretation is identified as the important step of the help seeking process and which changed across the process through active monitoring of their symptoms, social interactions and emotional reactions. The perceived seriousness of the situation, priority to receive medical attention, perceived inaccessibility and unacceptability of the health care system influenced women’s decision-making about utilizing health services. Conclusion Help seeking processes are influenced by multiple factors. Educational programs aimed at correcting misunderstandings, erroneous social beliefs and improving self-awareness could provide key strategies to improve health policy which would reduce patient delay."
2023,Deep Learning Based Methods for Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Future Direction,"Breast cancer is one of the precarious conditions that affect women, and a substantive cure has not yet been discovered for it. With the advent of Artificial intelligence (AI), recently, deep learning techniques have been used effectively in breast cancer detection, facilitating early diagnosis and therefore increasing the chances of patients’ survival. Compared to classical machine learning techniques, deep learning requires less human intervention for similar feature extraction. This study presents a systematic literature review on the deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection that can guide practitioners and researchers in understanding the challenges and new trends in the field. Particularly, different deep learning-based methods for breast cancer detection are investigated, focusing on the genomics and histopathological imaging data. The study specifically adopts the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), which offer a detailed analysis and synthesis of the published articles. Several studies were searched and gathered, and after the eligibility screening and quality evaluation, 98 articles were identified. The results of the review indicated that the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is the most accurate and extensively used model for breast cancer detection, and the accuracy metrics are the most popular method used for performance evaluation. Moreover, datasets utilized for breast cancer detection and the evaluation metrics are also studied. Finally, the challenges and future research direction in breast cancer detection based on deep learning models are also investigated to help researchers and practitioners acquire in-depth knowledge of and insight into the area."
2020,Friend or Foe: S100 Proteins in Cancer,"S100 proteins are widely expressed small molecular EF-hand calcium-binding proteins of vertebrates, which are involved in numerous cellular processes, such as Ca2+ homeostasis, proliferation, apoptosis, differentiation, and inflammation. Although the complex network of S100 signalling is by far not fully deciphered, several S100 family members could be linked to a variety of diseases, such as inflammatory disorders, neurological diseases, and also cancer. The research of the past decades revealed that S100 proteins play a crucial role in the development and progression of many cancer types, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. Hence, S100 family members have also been shown to be promising diagnostic markers and possible novel targets for therapy. However, the current knowledge of S100 proteins is limited and more attention to this unique group of proteins is needed. Therefore, this review article summarises S100 proteins and their relation in different cancer types, while also providing an overview of novel therapeutic strategies for targeting S100 proteins for cancer treatment."
2016,A randomized trial of videoconference‐delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for survivors of breast cancer with self‐reported cognitive dysfunction,"Long‐term chemotherapy‐related cognitive dysfunction (CRCD) affects a large number of cancer survivors. To the authors' knowledge, to date there is no established treatment for this survivorship problem. The authors herein report results of a small randomized controlled trial of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), Memory and Attention Adaptation Training (MAAT), compared with an attention control condition. Both treatments were delivered over a videoconference device."
2020,Targeting gut microbiota with dietary components on cancer: Effects and potential mechanisms of action,"Abstract Cancers are common chronic diseases worldwide and cause severe health burdens. There have been ongoing debates on the role of gut microbiota in the prevention and management of cancers, thus, it is worthwhile to pay high attention to the impacts of gut microbiota on several cancers, such as colon, liver, and breast cancers. In addition, it has been reported that gut microbiota may also affect the efficacy of cancer chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Among all the factors that influence gut microbiota, diet is the most influential and modifiable. The prebiotics, dietary fibers, short-chain fatty acids, and other bioactive compounds are all important dietary components to assist the growth of beneficial microbiota in the gut, which can protect against cancers and promote human health. Their beneficial effects can be due to the fermentation of dietary fibers, the metabolism of phytochemicals, the synthesis of estrogens, and interactions with chemotherapies and immunotherapies. In order to provide updated information of the relationships among dietary components, gut microbiota, and cancer, in this review, we summarize the reciprocal interactions between dietary components and gut microbiota, and highlight the impacts of dietary components on several common cancers by targeting gut microbiota, with the potential mechanisms of actions also intensively discussed. As a result, this review can be very helpful for healthy people as well as cancer patients to prevent or manage cancers via dietary factor-mediated regulation of gut microbiota."
2018,Association between body mass index and breast cancer risk: evidence based on a dose–response meta-analysis,"Introduction Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide. The association between body mass index (BMI) and breast cancer risk has been paid more attention in the past few years, but the findings are still controversial. To obtain a more reliable conclusion, we performed a dose–response meta-analysis on 12 prospective cohort studies comprising 22,728,674 participants. Methods Linear and nonlinear trend analyses were conducted to explore the dose–response relationship between BMI and breast cancer risk. The summary relative risk (SRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate the cancer risk. Results The overall results showed a weak positive association between a 5-unit increase in BMI and breast cancer risk, indicating that a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI corresponded to a 2% increase in breast cancer risk (SRR: 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01–1.04, p<0.001). Notably, further subgroup meta-analysis found that higher BMI could be a protective factor of breast cancer risk for premenopausal women (SRR: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.96–0.99, p<0.001). In addition, the dose–response result demonstrated that there was a linear association between BMI and breast cancer risk (Pnonlinearity=0.754). Conclusion In summary, this dose–response meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed that every 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI corresponded to a 2% increase in breast cancer risk in women. However, higher BMI could be a protective factor in breast cancer risk for premenopausal women. Further studies are necessary to verify these findings and elucidate the pathogenic mechanisms."
2021,Predicting breast cancer 5-year survival using machine learning: A systematic review,"Background Accurately predicting the survival rate of breast cancer patients is a major issue for cancer researchers. Machine learning (ML) has attracted much attention with the hope that it could provide accurate results, but its modeling methods and prediction performance remain controversial. The aim of this systematic review is to identify and critically appraise current studies regarding the application of ML in predicting the 5-year survival rate of breast cancer. Methods In accordance with the PRISMA guidelines, two researchers independently searched the PubMed (including MEDLINE), Embase, and Web of Science Core databases from inception to November 30, 2020. The search terms included breast neoplasms, survival, machine learning, and specific algorithm names. The included studies related to the use of ML to build a breast cancer survival prediction model and model performance that can be measured with the value of said verification results. The excluded studies in which the modeling process were not explained clearly and had incomplete information. The extracted information included literature information, database information, data preparation and modeling process information, model construction and performance evaluation information, and candidate predictor information. Results Thirty-one studies that met the inclusion criteria were included, most of which were published after 2013. The most frequently used ML methods were decision trees (19 studies, 61.3%), artificial neural networks (18 studies, 58.1%), support vector machines (16 studies, 51.6%), and ensemble learning (10 studies, 32.3%). The median sample size was 37256 (range 200 to 659820) patients, and the median predictor was 16 (range 3 to 625). The accuracy of 29 studies ranged from 0.510 to 0.971. The sensitivity of 25 studies ranged from 0.037 to 1. The specificity of 24 studies ranged from 0.008 to 0.993. The AUC of 20 studies ranged from 0.500 to 0.972. The precision of 6 studies ranged from 0.549 to 1. All of the models were internally validated, and only one was externally validated. Conclusions Overall, compared with traditional statistical methods, the performance of ML models does not necessarily show any improvement, and this area of research still faces limitations related to a lack of data preprocessing steps, the excessive differences of sample feature selection, and issues related to validation. Further optimization of the performance of the proposed model is also needed in the future, which requires more standardization and subsequent validation."
2014,Cross-study validation for the assessment of prediction algorithms,"Motivation: Numerous competing algorithms for prediction in high-dimensional settings have been developed in the statistical and machine-learning literature. Learning algorithms and the prediction models they generate are typically evaluated on the basis of cross-validation error estimates in a few exemplary datasets. However, in most applications, the ultimate goal of prediction modeling is to provide accurate predictions for independent samples obtained in different settings. Cross-validation within exemplary datasets may not adequately reflect performance in the broader application context. Methods: We develop and implement a systematic approach to ‘cross-study validation’, to replace or supplement conventional cross-validation when evaluating high-dimensional prediction models in independent datasets. We illustrate it via simulations and in a collection of eight estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer microarray gene-expression datasets, where the objective is predicting distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS). We computed the C-index for all pairwise combinations of training and validation datasets. We evaluate several alternatives for summarizing the pairwise validation statistics, and compare these to conventional cross-validation. Results: Our data-driven simulations and our application to survival prediction with eight breast cancer microarray datasets, suggest that standard cross-validation produces inflated discrimination accuracy for all algorithms considered, when compared to cross-study validation. Furthermore, the ranking of learning algorithms differs, suggesting that algorithms performing best in cross-validation may be suboptimal when evaluated through independent validation.

2020,Methods Used in Computer-Aided Diagnosis for Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammograms: A Review,"According to the American Cancer Society's forecasts for 2019, there will be about 268,600 new cases in the United States with invasive breast cancer in women, about 62,930 new noninvasive cases, and about 41,760 death cases from breast cancer. As a result, there is a high demand for breast imaging specialists as indicated in a recent report for the Institute of Medicine and National Research Council. One way to meet this demand is through developing Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems for breast cancer detection and diagnosis using mammograms. This study aims to review recent advancements and developments in CAD systems for breast cancer detection and diagnosis using mammograms and to give an overview of the methods used in its steps starting from preprocessing and enhancement step and ending in classification step. The current level of performance for the CAD systems is encouraging but not enough to make CAD systems standalone detection and diagnose clinical systems. Unless the performance of CAD systems enhanced dramatically from its current level by enhancing the existing methods, exploiting new promising methods in pattern recognition like data augmentation in deep learning and exploiting the advances in computational power of computers, CAD systems will continue to be a second opinion clinical procedure."
2019,Pathology GAN: Learning deep representations of cancer tissue,"Histopathological images of tumours contain abundant information about how tumours grow and how they interact with their micro-environment. Better understanding of tissue phenotypes in these images could reveal novel determinants of pathological processes underlying cancer, and in turn improve diagnosis and treatment options. Advances of Deep learning makes it ideal to achieve those goals, however, its application is limited by the cost of high quality labels from patients data. Unsupervised learning, in particular, deep generative models with representation learning properties provides an alternative path to further understand cancer tissue phenotypes, capturing tissue morphologies. In this paper, we develop a framework which allows Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture key tissue features and uses these characteristics to give structure to its latent space. To this end, we trained our model on two different datasets, an H&E colorectal cancer tissue from the National Center for Tumor diseases (NCT, Germany) and an H&E breast cancer tissue from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Netherlands) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH, Canada). Composed of 86 slide images and 576 tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) respectively. We show that our model generates high quality images, with a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 16.65 (breast cancer) and 32.05 (colorectal cancer). We further assess the quality of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of cancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells), using quantitative information to calculate the FID and showing consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the latent space of our model shows an interpretable structure and allows semantic vector operations that translate into tissue feature transformations. Furthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists found no significant difference between our generated tissue images from real ones.

2016,Decline in Cognitive Function in Older Adults With Early-Stage Breast Cancer After Adjuvant Treatment.,"BACKGROUND The impact of chemotherapy on cognition among elderly patients has received little attention, although such patients are more prone to presenting with age-related cognitive deficits and/or cognitive decline during chemotherapy. The present study assessed the cognitive function in older adults treated for early-stage breast cancer (EBC). PATIENTS AND METHODS The participants were newly diagnosed EBC patients aged ≥65 years without previous systemic treatment or neurological or psychiatric disease and matched healthy controls. They underwent two assessments: before starting adjuvant therapy and after the end of chemotherapy (including doxorubicin ± docetaxel [CT+ group], n = 58) or radiotherapy for patients who did not receive chemotherapy (CT- group, n = 61), and at the same interval for the healthy controls (n = 62). Neuropsychological and geriatric assessments were performed. Neuropsychological data were analyzed using the Reliable Change Index. RESULTS Forty-nine percent of the patients (mean age, 70 ± 4 years) had objective cognitive decline after adjuvant treatment that mainly concerned working memory. Among these patients, 64% developed a cognitive impairment after adjuvant treatment. Comorbidity was not associated with cognitive decline. No significant difference in objective cognitive decline was found between the two groups of patients; however, the CT+ group had more subjective cognitive complaints after treatment (p = .008). The oldest patients (aged 70-81 years) tended to have more objective decline with docetaxel (p = .05). CONCLUSION This is the largest published study assessing cognitive function in older adults with EBC that included a group of patients treated with modern chemotherapy regimens. Approximately half the patients had objective cognitive decline after adjuvant treatment. The oldest patients were more likely to have cognitive decline with chemotherapy, particularly with docetaxel. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE This is the largest published study assessing cognitive function in older adults with early-stage breast cancer that included a group of patients treated with modern chemotherapy regimens. Approximately half the patients had objective cognitive decline after adjuvant treatment. The oldest patients were more likely to have cognitive decline with chemotherapy, particularly with docetaxel. Cognitive deficits could affect patients' quality of life and their compliance to treatment. Assessing cognitive dysfunctions in the elderly cancer population is a challenge in clinical practice, but it could influence the choice of the most appropriate therapy, including the use of oral drugs."
2018,Applying Best Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Prediction and Classification,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in the world, accounting for the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics, making it a significant public health problem in today's society. In this paper, we will present an overview of the evolution of large data in the health system, and apply four learning algorithms to a breast cancer data set. The aim of this research work is to predict breast cancer, which is the second leading cause of death among women worldwide, and with early detection and prevention can dramatically reduce the risk of death, using several machine-learning algorithms that are Random Forest, Naïve Bayes, Support Vector Machines SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors K-NN, and chose the most effective. The experimental results show that SVM gives the highest accuracy 97.9%. The finding will help to select the best classification machine-learning algorithm for breast cancer prediction."
2014,Pretreatment worry and neurocognitive responses in women with breast cancer.,"UNLABELLED [Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 33(3) of Health Psychology (see record 2014-07787-001). The name of author Misook Jung was misspelled as Mi Sook Jung. All versions of this article have been corrected.] OBJECTIVE Altered cognitive function has been associated with breast cancer treatment, particularly adjuvant chemotherapy, but the underlying neuropsychological mechanisms are not yet understood. Recent research indicates that compromised attention and working memory can exist before adjuvant treatment, implicating psychological distress, such as worry, as a possible contributor to observed alterations in cognitive function. We hypothesized that worry associated with breast cancer diagnosis might influence neurocognitive responses before any adjuvant therapy. DESIGN Fifty women, 25 due to receive chemotherapy and 25 due to receive radiation therapy, participated in the study. Women performed a verbal working memory task during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to assess neurocognitive responses before any adjuvant treatment and to test the relationship of such responses with self-reports of worry. RESULTS Although prechemotherapy participants showed significantly higher levels of worry compared with preradiation participants, higher worry, across both groups, was related to altered brain function. Specifically, increased worry was associated with reduced demand-related deactivation in default-mode regions, such as the precuneus/posterior cingulate. Reduced demand-related deactivation was critically related to worse behavioral performance, which was partially mediated by worry. CONCLUSION Worry appears to be a significant contributor to neurocognitive dysfunction independent of adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. These results suggest that alterations in cognitive function may develop before any chemotherapy treatment and that worry about cancer diagnosis may contribute to reports of ""chemo brain"" during treatment. Psychological interventions aimed at mitigating worry may help to alleviate cognitive dysfunction associated with life-threatening illness such as breast cancer."
2019,netDx: interpretable patient classification using integrated patient similarity networks,"Patient classification has widespread biomedical and clinical applications, including diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction. A clinically useful prediction algorithm should be accurate, generalizable, be able to integrate diverse data types, and handle sparse data. A clinical predictor based on genomic data needs to be interpretable to drive hypothesis‐driven research into new treatments. We describe netDx, a novel supervised patient classification framework based on patient similarity networks, which meets these criteria. In a cancer survival benchmark dataset integrating up to six data types in four cancer types, netDx significantly outperforms most other machine‐learning approaches across most cancer types. Compared to traditional machine‐learning‐based patient classifiers, netDx results are more interpretable, visualizing the decision boundary in the context of patient similarity space. When patient similarity is defined by pathway‐level gene expression, netDx identifies biological pathways important for outcome prediction, as demonstrated in breast cancer and asthma. netDx can serve as a patient classifier and as a tool for discovery of biological features characteristic of disease. We provide a free software implementation of netDx with automation workflows."
2019,Texture Analysis with 3.0-T MRI for Association of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer.,"Background Previous studies have suggested that texture analysis is a promising tool in the diagnosis, characterization, and assessment of treatment response in various cancer types. Therefore, application of texture analysis may be helpful for early prediction of pathologic response in breast cancer. Purpose To investigate whether texture analysis of features from MRI is associated with pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 136 women (mean age, 47.9 years; range, 31-70 years) who underwent NAC and subsequent surgery for breast cancer between January 2012 and August 2017. Patients were monitored with 3.0-T MRI before (pretreatment) and after (midtreatment) three or four cycles of NAC. Texture analysis was performed at pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast material-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping by using commercial software. A random forest method was applied to build a predictive model for classifying those with pCR with use of texture parameters. Diagnostic performance for predicting pCR was assessed and compared with that of six other machine learning classifiers (adaptive boosting, decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, linear support vector machine, naive Bayes, and linear discriminant analysis) by using the Wald test and DeLong method. Results Forty of the 136 patients (29%) achieved pCR after NAC. In the prediction of pCR, the random forest classifier showed the lowest diagnostic performance with pretreatment ADC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.53; 95% confidence interval: 0.44, 0.61) and the highest diagnostic performance with midtreatment contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI (AUC, 0.82; 95% confidence interval: 0.74, 0.88) among pre- and midtreatment T2-weighted MRI, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, and ADC mapping. Conclusion Texture parameters using a random forest method of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI at midtreatment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy were valuable and associated with pathologic complete response in breast cancer. © RSNA, 2019 Online supplemental material is available for this article."
2020,A Review on Recent Progress in Thermal Imaging and Deep Learning Approaches for Breast Cancer Detection,"Developing a breast cancer screening method is very important to facilitate early breast cancer detection and treatment. Building a screening method using medical imaging modality that does not cause body tissue damage (non-invasive) and does not involve physical touch is challenging. Thermography, a non-invasive and non-contact cancer screening method, can detect tumors at an early stage even under precancerous conditions by observing temperature distribution in both breasts. The thermograms obtained on thermography can be interpreted using deep learning models such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs can automatically classify breast thermograms into categories such as normal and abnormal. Despite their demostrated utility, CNNs have not been widely used in breast thermogram classification. In this study, we aimed to summarize the current work and progress in breast cancer detection based on thermography and CNNs. We first discuss of breast thermography potential in early breast cancer detection, providing an overview of the availability of breast thermal datasets together with publicly accessible. We also discuss characteristics of breast thermograms and the differences between healthy and cancerous thermographic patterns. Breast thermogram classification using a CNN model is described step by step including a simulation example illustrating feature learning. We cover most research related to the implementation of deep neural networks for breast thermogram classification and propose future research directions for developing representative datasets, feeding the segmented image, assigning a good kernel, and building a lightweight CNN model to improve CNN performance."
2022,Application of Deep Learning in Breast Cancer Imaging.,"This review gives an overview of the current state of deep learning research in breast cancer imaging. Breast imaging plays a major role in detecting breast cancer at an earlier stage, as well as monitoring and evaluating breast cancer during treatment. The most commonly used modalities for breast imaging are digital mammography, digital breast tomosynthesis, ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging. Nuclear medicine imaging techniques are used for detection and classification of axillary lymph nodes and distant staging in breast cancer imaging. All of these techniques are currently digitized, enabling the possibility to implement deep learning (DL), a subset of Artificial intelligence, in breast imaging. DL is nowadays embedded in a plethora of different tasks, such as lesion classification and segmentation, image reconstruction and generation, cancer risk prediction, and prediction and assessment of therapy response. Studies show similar and even better performances of DL algorithms compared to radiologists, although it is clear that large trials are needed, especially for ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, to exactly determine the added value of DL in breast cancer imaging. Studies on DL in nuclear medicine techniques are only sparsely available and further research is mandatory. Legal and ethical issues need to be considered before the role of DL can expand to its full potential in clinical breast care practice."
2019,Development of Genome-Derived Tumor Type Prediction to Inform Clinical Cancer Care.,"Importance Diagnosing the site of origin for cancer is a pillar of disease classification that has directed clinical care for more than a century. Even in an era of precision oncologic practice, in which treatment is increasingly informed by the presence or absence of mutant genes responsible for cancer growth and progression, tumor origin remains a critical factor in tumor biologic characteristics and therapeutic sensitivity. Objective To evaluate whether data derived from routine clinical DNA sequencing of tumors could complement conventional approaches to enable improved diagnostic accuracy. Design, Setting, and Participants A machine learning approach was developed to predict tumor type from targeted panel DNA sequence data obtained at the point of care, incorporating both discrete molecular alterations and inferred features such as mutational signatures. This algorithm was trained on 7791 tumors representing 22 cancer types selected from a prospectively sequenced cohort of patients with advanced cancer. Results The correct tumor type was predicted for 5748 of the 7791 patients (73.8%) in the training set as well as 8623 of 11 644 patients (74.1%) in an independent cohort. Predictions were assigned probabilities that reflected empirical accuracy, with 3388 cases (43.5%) representing high-confidence predictions (>95% probability). Informative molecular features and feature categories varied widely by tumor type. Genomic analysis of plasma cell-free DNA yielded accurate predictions in 45 of 60 cases (75.0%), suggesting that this approach may be applied in diverse clinical settings including as an adjunct to cancer screening. Likely tissues of origin were predicted from targeted tumor sequencing in 95 of 141 patients (67.4%) with cancers of unknown primary site. Applying this method prospectively to patients under active care enabled genome-directed reassessment of diagnosis in 2 patients initially presumed to have metastatic breast cancer, leading to the selection of more appropriate treatments, which elicited clinical responses. Conclusions and Relevance These results suggest that the application of artificial intelligence to predict tissue of origin in oncologic practice can act as a useful complement to conventional histologic review to provide integrated pathologic diagnoses, often with important therapeutic implications."
2022,Artificial Intelligent Label-Free SERS Profiling of Serum Exosomes for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Postoperative Assessment.,"Breast cancer subtypes have important implications of treatment responses and clinical outcomes. Exosomes have been considered as promising biomarkers for liquid biopsies, but the utility of exosomes for accurate diagnosis of distinct breast cancer subtypes is a grand challenge due to the difficulty in uncovering the subtle compositional difference in complex clinical settings. Herein, we report an artificial intelligent surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) strategy for label-free spectroscopic analysis of serum exosomes, allowing for accurate diagnosis of breast cancer and assessment of surgical outcomes. Our deep learning algorithm trained with SERS spectra of cancer cell-derived exosomes is demonstrated with a 100% prediction accuracy for human patients with different breast cancer subtypes who do not undergo surgery using SERS spectra of serum exosomes. Furthermore, when combined with similarity analysis by principal component analysis, our approach is able to evaluate the surgical outcomes of breast cancer of distinct molecular subtypes."
2017,Targeting integrins with RGD-conjugated gold nanoparticles in radiotherapy decreases the invasive activity of breast cancer cells,"Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have recently attracted attention as clinical agents for enhancing the effect of radiotherapy in various cancers. Although radiotherapy is a standard treatment for cancers, invasive recurrence and metastasis are significant clinical problems. Several studies have suggested that radiation promotes the invasion of cancer cells by activating molecular mechanisms involving integrin and fibronectin (FN). In this study, polyethylene-glycolylated AuNPs (P-AuNPs) were conjugated with Arg–Gly–Asp (RGD) peptides (RGD/P-AuNPs) to target cancer cells expressing RGD-binding integrins such as α5- and αv-integrins. RGD/P-AuNPs were internalized more efficiently and colocalized with integrins in the late endosomes and lysosomes of MDA-MB-231 cells. A combination of RGD/P-AuNPs and radiation reduced cancer cell viability and increased DNA damage compared to radiation alone in MDA-MB-231 cells. Moreover, the invasive activity of breast cancer cell lines after radiation treatment was significantly inhibited in the presence of RGD/P-AuNPs. Microarray analyses revealed that the expression of FN in irradiated cells was suppressed by combined use of RGD/P-AuNPs. Reduction of FN and downstream signaling may be involved in suppressing radiation-induced invasive activity by RGD/P-AuNPs. Our study suggests that RGD/P-AuNPs can target integrin-overexpressing cancer cells to improve radiation therapy by suppressing invasive activity in addition to sensitization. Thus, these findings provide a possible clinical strategy for using AuNPs to treat invasive breast cancer following radiotherapy."
2018,Anthracycline and trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer.,"OBJECTIVE Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. In the last twenty years early diagnosis, neoadjuvant and adjuvant systemic treatment that targeted to specific molecular targets have significantly reduced the mortality from breast cancer. However, the increase in survival has allowed to observe the cardiotoxic effects of anticancer therapy and increased mortality from cardiovascular causes, resulting in a large literature where experts try to identify the correct management of this critical problem. Even thought the increased attention in this field, many questions have not yet answers and new studies are needed. MATERIALS AND METHODS We conducted a broad search of the English-language literature in Medline using the following search terms: cardiotoxicity, anthracyclines, trastuzumab, breast cancer, left ventricular dysfunction, heart failure. A manual examination of the articles found has been performed. RESULTS We provide a comprehensive assessment of the current knowledge about cardiotoxicity induced by anthracycline plus trastuzumab in women affected by breast cancer. CONCLUSIONS Early identification and prompt treatment of subclinical cardiotoxicity may improve cardiologic prognosis of these patients and may allow oncologists to avoid withdrawal of chemotherapy. That is why it becomes always more important the creation of multidisciplinary teams where cardiologists and oncologists work together to ensure optimal care to oncologic patients treated with cardiotoxic agents."
2017,Stromal lymphocyte infiltration after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated with aggressive residual disease and lower disease-free survival in HER2-positive breast cancer,"Background The role of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer has been extensively studied over the last decade. High TILs levels have been associated with pathological response rate in the neoadjuvant setting and with better outcomes in the adjuvant setting. However, little attention has been paid to changes in TILs and residual TIL levels after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC). We investigated TIL levels before, after chemotherapy, and their dynamics during treatment; and we assessed the correlation of these levels with response to NAC and prognosis. Materials and methods We identified 175 patients with primary HER2-positive breast cancers receiving NAC+/- trastuzumab between 2002 and 2011. Microbiopsy specimens and paired surgical samples were evaluated for stromal lymphocyte infiltration. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to assess the association of clinical and pathological factors with pathological complete response (pCR) and disease-free survival. Results Baseline TIL levels were not significantly associated with pCR. TIL levels decreased during treatment in 78% of the patients. The magnitude of the decrease was strongly associated with pCR. After chemotherapy, TIL levels were high in tumors displaying aggressive patterns (high residual cancer burden score, mitotic index >22, tumor cellularity >5%). In the population with residual disease, TIL levels >25% at the end of NAC were significantly associated with an adverse outcome (TILs >25%, HR = 7.98, P = 0.009) after multivariate analyses including BMI, post-NAC mitotic index and tumor grade. Conclusion A decrease in TIL levels during chemotherapy was positively associated with response to treatment. In tumor failing to achieve pCR, post-NAC lymphocytic infiltration was associated with higher residual tumor burden and adverse clinical outcome. Further studies are required to characterize immune infiltration in residual disease to identify candidates who could benefit from second-line therapy trials including immune checkpoint inhibitors."
2022,Addressing Binary Classification over Class Imbalanced Clinical Datasets Using Computationally Intelligent Techniques,"Nowadays, healthcare is the prime need of every human being in the world, and clinical datasets play an important role in developing an intelligent healthcare system for monitoring the health of people. Mostly, the real-world datasets are inherently class imbalanced, clinical datasets also suffer from this imbalance problem, and the imbalanced class distributions pose several issues in the training of classifiers. Consequently, classifiers suffer from low accuracy, precision, recall, and a high degree of misclassification, etc. We performed a brief literature review on the class imbalanced learning scenario. This study carries the empirical performance evaluation of six classifiers, namely Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Logistic regression, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naïve Bayes, over five imbalanced clinical datasets, Breast Cancer Disease, Coronary Heart Disease, Indian Liver Patient, Pima Indians Diabetes Database, and Coronary Kidney Disease, with respect to seven different class balancing techniques, namely Undersampling, Random oversampling, SMOTE, ADASYN, SVM-SMOTE, SMOTEEN, and SMOTETOMEK. In addition to this, the appropriate explanations for the superiority of the classifiers as well as data-balancing techniques are also explored. Furthermore, we discuss the possible recommendations on how to tackle the class imbalanced datasets while training the different supervised machine learning methods. Result analysis demonstrates that SMOTEEN balancing method often performed better over all the other six data-balancing techniques with all six classifiers and for all five clinical datasets. Except for SMOTEEN, all other six balancing techniques almost had equal performance but moderately lesser performance than SMOTEEN."
2022,A Novel Multistage Transfer Learning for Ultrasound Breast Cancer Image Classification,"Breast cancer diagnosis is one of the many areas that has taken advantage of artificial intelligence to achieve better performance, despite the fact that the availability of a large medical image dataset remains a challenge. Transfer learning (TL) is a phenomenon that enables deep learning algorithms to overcome the issue of shortage of training data in constructing an efficient model by transferring knowledge from a given source task to a target task. However, in most cases, ImageNet (natural images) pre-trained models that do not include medical images, are utilized for transfer learning to medical images. Considering the utilization of microscopic cancer cell line images that can be acquired in large amount, we argue that learning from both natural and medical datasets improves performance in ultrasound breast cancer image classification. The proposed multistage transfer learning (MSTL) algorithm was implemented using three pre-trained models: EfficientNetB2, InceptionV3, and ResNet50 with three optimizers: Adam, Adagrad, and stochastic gradient de-scent (SGD). Dataset sizes of 20,400 cancer cell images, 200 ultrasound images from Mendeley and 400 ultrasound images from the MT-Small-Dataset were used. ResNet50-Adagrad-based MSTL achieved a test accuracy of 99 ± 0.612% on the Mendeley dataset and 98.7 ± 1.1% on the MT-Small-Dataset, averaging over 5-fold cross validation. A p-value of 0.01191 was achieved when comparing MSTL against ImageNet based TL for the Mendeley dataset. The result is a significant improvement in the performance of artificial intelligence methods for ultrasound breast cancer classification compared to state-of-the-art methods and could remarkably improve the early diagnosis of breast cancer in young women."
2016,Natural Products as Promising Antitumoral Agents in Breast Cancer: Mechanisms of Action and Molecular Targets.,"Extensive research over the past several decades has identified numerous dietary and phytochemical compounds that have chemopreventive potential and could represent an important source of anti-cancer lead molecules. In this scenario several nutritional factors have attracted considerable attention as modifiable risk factor in the prevention of breast cancer, the most frequently diagnosed cancer and a major cause of death among women worldwide. There is an immediate need for more effective and less toxic therapeutic and preventive strategies for breast cancers able also to counteract the recurrent phenomenon of resistance to hormonal and targeted therapy that represent the first-line treatment in the management of breast cancer patients. The present review focuses on chemopreventive and anti-cancer activities of different bioactive compounds obtained from dietary sources such as Omega-3 fatty acids, naturally present in fish, Resveratrol (3,5,40-trihydroxy-transstilbene), a phytoalexin found in grapes and Epigallocatechin Gallate, a polyphenolic compound found in green tea, or purified from medicinal plant (Oldenlandia Diffusa) and fruits (Ziziphus Jujube) highlighting their potential use in breast cancer treatment. Herein, we discuss the molecular mechanisms by which the bioactive compounds can inhibit carcinogenesis by regulating antioxidant enzyme activities, and inducing antiproliferative and apoptotic effects in different breast cancer cell lines. Understanding the mechanism of action of dietary compounds or traditionally used herbs having potential preventive and therapeutic effects on cancer may provide a rationale for further translational studies. This review emphasizes the importance, in the next future, of a proper scientific validation of these natural bioactive compounds for clinical use in the therapeutic portfolio for breast cancer."
2019,BRCA1/BRCA2 Pathogenic Variant Breast Cancer: Treatment and Prevention Strategies,"Hereditary breast cancer is known for its strong tendency of inheritance. Most hereditary breast cancers are related to BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variants. The lifelong risk of breast cancer in pathogenic BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant carriers is approximately 65% and 45%, respectively, whereas that of ovarian cancer is estimated to be 39% and 11%, respectively. Therefore, understanding these variants and clinical knowledge on their occurrence in breast cancers and carriers are important. BRCA1 pathogenic variant breast cancer shows more aggressive clinicopathological features than the BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer. Compared with sporadic breast cancer, their prognosis is still debated. Treatments of BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer are similar to those for BRCA-negative breast cancer, mainly including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Recently, various clinical trials have investigated poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor treatment for advanced-stage BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer. Among the various PARP inhibitors, olaparib and talazoparib, which reached phase III clinical trials, showed improvement of median progression-free survival around three months. Preventive and surveillance strategies for BRCA pathogenic variant breast cancer to reduce cancer recurrence and improve treatment outcomes have recently received increasing attention. In this review, we provide an information on the clinical features of BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer and clinical recommendations for BRCA pathogenic variant carriers, with a focus on treatment and prevention strategies. With this knowledge, clinicians could manage the BRCA1/BRCA2 pathogenic variant breast cancer patients more effectively."
2019,Deep learning modeling using normal mammograms for predicting breast cancer risk.,"PURPOSE To investigate two deep learning-based modeling schemes for predicting short-term risk of developing breast cancer using prior normal screening digital mammograms in a case-control setting. METHODS We conducted a retrospective Institutional Review Board-approved study on a case-control cohort of 226 patients (including 113 women diagnosed with breast cancer and 113 controls) who underwent general population breast cancer screening. For each patient, a prior normal (i.e., with negative or benign findings) digital mammogram examination (including mediolateral oblique [MLO] view and craniocaudal [CC] view two images) was collected. Thus, a total of 452 normal images (226 MLO view images and 226 CC view images) of this case-control cohort were analyzed to predict the outcome, i.e., developing breast cancer (cancer cases) or remaining breast cancer-free (controls) within the follow-up period. We implemented an end-to-end deep learning model and a GoogLeNet-LDA model and compared their effects in several experimental settings using two mammographic view images and inputting two different sub-regions of the images to the models. The proposed models were also compared to logistic regression modeling of mammographic breast density. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used as the model performance metric. RESULTS The highest AUC was 0.73 (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.68 - 0.78; GoogLeNet-LDA model on CC view) when using the whole-breast and was 0.72 (95% CI: 0.67- 0.76; GoogLeNet-LDA model on MLO+CC view) when using the dense tissue, respectively, as the model input. The GoogleNet-LDA model significantly (all p<0.05) outperformed the end-to-end GoogLeNet model in all experiments. CC view was consistently more predictive than MLO view in both deep learning models, regardless the input sub-regions. Both models exhibited superior performance than the percent breast density (AUC=0.54; 95% CI: 0.49-0.59). CONCLUSIONS The proposed deep learning modeling approach can predict short-term breast cancer risk using normal screening mammogram images. Larger studies are needed to further reveal the promise of deep learning in enhancing imaging-based breast cancer risk assessment."
2017,Prognostic significance of marital status in breast cancer survival: A population-based study,"Research shows that married cancer patients have lower mortality than unmarried patients but few data exist for breast cancer. We assessed total mortality associated with marital status, with attention to differences by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and neighborhood socioeconomic status (nSES). We included, from the population-based California Cancer Registry, women ages 18 and older with invasive breast cancer diagnosed between 2005 and 2012 with follow-up through December 2013. We estimated mortality rate ratios (MRR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total mortality by nSES, race/ethnicity, and tumor subtype. Among 145,564 breast cancer cases, 42.7% were unmarried at the time of diagnosis. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MRR (95% CI) for unmarried compared to married women was 1.28 (1.24–1.32) for total mortality. Significant interactions were observed by race/ethnicity (P<0.001), tumor subtype (P<0.001), and nSES (P = 0.009). Higher MRRs were observed for non-Hispanic whites and Asians/Pacific Islanders than for blacks or Hispanics, and for HR+/HER2+ tumors than other subtypes. Assessment of interactive effect between marital status and nSES showed that unmarried women living in low SES neighborhoods had a higher risk of dying compared with married women in high SES neighborhoods (MRR = 1.60; 95% CI: 1.53–1.67). Unmarried breast cancer patients have higher total mortality than married patients; the association varies by race/ethnicity, tumor subtype, and nSES. Unmarried status should be further evaluated as a breast cancer prognostic factor. Identification of underlying causes of the marital status associations is needed to design interventions that could improve survival for unmarried breast cancer patients."
2020,Radiomics Improves Cancer Screening and Early Detection,"Imaging is a key technology in the early detection of cancers, including X-ray mammography, low-dose CT for lung cancer, or optical imaging for skin, esophageal, or colorectal cancers. Historically, imaging information in early detection schema was assessed qualitatively. However, the last decade has seen increased development of computerized tools that convert images into quantitative mineable data (radiomics), and their subsequent analyses with artificial intelligence (AI). These tools are improving diagnostic accuracy of early lesions to define risk and classify malignant/aggressive from benign/indolent disease. The first section of this review will briefly describe the various imaging modalities and their use as primary or secondary screens in an early detection pipeline. The second section will describe specific use cases to illustrate the breadth of imaging modalities as well as the benefits of quantitative image analytics. These will include optical (skin cancer), X-ray CT (pancreatic and lung cancer), X-ray mammography (breast cancer), multiparametric MRI (breast and prostate cancer), PET (pancreatic cancer), and ultrasound elastography (liver cancer). Finally, we will discuss the inexorable improvements in radiomics to build more robust classifier models and the significant limitations to this development, including access to well-annotated databases, and biological descriptors of the imaged feature data.

2017,Staged Suprapectoral Expander/Implant Reconstruction without Acellular Dermal Matrix following Nipple-Sparing Mastectomy,"Background: Since the introduction of nipple-sparing mastectomy as an oncologically safe procedure for the treatment of breast cancer, reconstructive efforts for immediate staged expander/implant reconstruction have focused on submuscular implantation with or without acellular dermal matrix. Suprapectoral reconstruction without acellular dermal matrix has received little attention in the reconstructive literature of nipple-sparing mastectomy. Methods: Between 2005 and 2015, 155 patients (250 breasts) underwent nipple-sparing mastectomy with prepectoral staged expander/implant reconstruction using thick mastectomy skin flaps without acellular dermal matrix. Patients with different breast sizes, including those patients with very large breasts who required a primary mastopexy, were considered candidates for the suprapectoral reconstruction. Tumor-related data, comorbidities, and preoperative or postoperative radiation therapy were evaluated for correlation with the final outcome. Results: Patients were followed up for an average of 55.5 months (range, 138.1 to 23.6 months). The tumor recurrence rate was 2.6 percent. Adverse outcomes such as capsular contracture, implant dystopia, and rippling were studied. Aesthetic outcome, based on a three-point evaluation scale, showed 53.6 percent of patients as having a very good result, 31.6 percent showing a good result, 9 percent showing a fair result, and 5.8 percent showing a poor result. Conclusions: The suprapectoral two-stage expander/implant reconstruction without acellular dermal matrix in nipple-sparing mastectomy has certain advantages with respect to breast shape, less morbidity related to expansion, ease of reconstruction, and cost effectiveness. These advantages have to be weighed against those of subpectoral reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix to determine the method of choice. CLINCAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Therapeutic, IV."
2019,deepDriver: Predicting Cancer Driver Genes Based on Somatic Mutations Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks,"With the advances in high-throughput technologies, millions of somatic mutations have been reported in the past decade. Identifying driver genes with oncogenic mutations from these data is a critical and challenging problem. Many computational methods have been proposed to predict driver genes. Among them, machine learning-based methods usually train a classifier with representations that concatenate various types of features extracted from different kinds of data. Although successful, simply concatenating different types of features may not be the best way to fuse these data. We notice that a few types of data characterize the similarities of genes, to better integrate them with other data and improve the accuracy of driver gene prediction, in this study, a deep learning-based method (deepDriver) is proposed by performing convolution on mutation-based features of genes and their neighbors in the similarity networks. The method allows the convolutional neural network to learn information within mutation data and similarity networks simultaneously, which enhances the prediction of driver genes. deepDriver achieves AUC scores of 0.984 and 0.976 on breast cancer and colorectal cancer, which are superior to the competing algorithms. Further evaluations of the top 10 predictions also demonstrate that deepDriver is valuable for predicting new driver genes."
2016,Depression Screening Using Daily Mental-Health Ratings from a Smartphone Application for Breast Cancer Patients,"Background Mobile mental-health trackers are mobile phone apps that gather self-reported mental-health ratings from users. They have received great attention from clinicians as tools to screen for depression in individual patients. While several apps that ask simple questions using face emoticons have been developed, there has been no study examining the validity of their screening performance. Objective In this study, we (1) evaluate the potential of a mobile mental-health tracker that uses three daily mental-health ratings (sleep satisfaction, mood, and anxiety) as indicators for depression, (2) discuss three approaches to data processing (ratio, average, and frequency) for generating indicator variables, and (3) examine the impact of adherence on reporting using a mobile mental-health tracker and accuracy in depression screening. Methods We analyzed 5792 sets of daily mental-health ratings collected from 78 breast cancer patients over a 48-week period. Using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) as the measure of true depression status, we conducted a random-effect logistic panel regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to evaluate the screening performance of the mobile mental-health tracker. In addition, we classified patients into two subgroups based on their adherence level (higher adherence and lower adherence) using a k-means clustering algorithm and compared the screening accuracy between the two groups. Results With the ratio approach, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) is 0.8012, indicating that the performance of depression screening using daily mental-health ratings gathered via mobile mental-health trackers is comparable to the results of PHQ-9 tests. Also, the AUC is significantly higher (P=.002) for the higher adherence group (AUC=0.8524) than for the lower adherence group (AUC=0.7234). This result shows that adherence to self-reporting is associated with a higher accuracy of depression screening. Conclusions Our results support the potential of a mobile mental-health tracker as a tool for screening for depression in practice. Also, this study provides clinicians with a guideline for generating indicator variables from daily mental-health ratings. Furthermore, our results provide empirical evidence for the critical role of adherence to self-reporting, which represents crucial information for both doctors and patients."
2016,A Small Molecule That Represses Translation of G-Quadruplex-Containing mRNA.,"The G-quadruplexes form highly stable nucleic acid structures, which are implicated in various biological processes in both DNA and RNA. Although DNA G-quadruplexes have been studied in great detail, biological roles of RNA G-quadruplexes have received less attention. Here, a screening of a chemical library permitted identification of a small-molecule tool that binds selectively to RNA G-quadruplex structures. The polyaromatic molecule, RGB-1, stabilizes RNA G-quadruplex, but not DNA versions or other RNA structures. RGB-1 intensified the G-quadruplex-mediated inhibition of RNA translation in mammalian cells, decreased expression of the NRAS proto-oncogene in breast cancer cells, and permitted identification of a novel sequence that forms G-quadruplex in NRAS mRNA. RGB-1 may serve as a unique tool for understanding cellular roles of RNA G-quadruplex structures."
2014,Metformin may function as anti-cancer agent via targeting cancer stem cells: the potential biological significance of tumor-associated miRNAs in breast and pancreatic cancers.,"Metformin is one of the most used diabetic drugs for the management of type II diabetes mellitus (DM) in the world. Increased numbers of epidemiological and clinical studies have provided convincing evidence supporting the role of metformin in the development and progression of a variety of human tumors including breast and pancreatic cancer. Substantial pre-clinical evidence from in vitro and in vivo experimental studies strongly suggests that metformin has an anti-cancer activity mediated through the regulation of several cell signaling pathways including activation of AMP kinase (AMPK), and other direct and indirect mechanisms; however, the detailed mechanism(s) has not yet been fully understood. The concept of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has gained significant attention in recent years due its identification and defining its clinical implications in many different tumors including breast cancer and pancreatic cancer. In this review, we will discuss the protective role of metformin in the development of breast and pancreatic cancers. We will further discuss the role of metformin as an anti-cancer agent, which is in part mediated through targeting CSCs. Finally, we will discuss the potential role of metformin in the modulation of tumor-associated or CSC-associated microRNAs (miRNAs) as part of the novel mechanism of action of metformin in the development and progression of breast and pancreatic cancers."
2014,"Panepoxydone Targets NF-kB and FOXM1 to Inhibit Proliferation, Induce Apoptosis and Reverse Epithelial to Mesenchymal Transition in Breast Cancer","Background Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a highly diverse group that is associated with an aggressive phenotype. Its treatment has been challenging due to its heterogeneity and absence of well-defined molecular targets. Thus, there is an urgent need to identify novel agents with therapeutic application. NF-κB is over-expressed in many breast cancers; thus, inactivation of the NF-κB pathway could serve as a therapeutic target. Here we report for the first time the anti-tumor activity of panepoxydone (PP), a NF-κB inhibitor isolated from an edible mushroom, in several breast cancer cell lines. Methods We investigated the effects of PP on cell growth, migration-invasion, apoptosis and EMT-related proteins expression in MCF-7 and TNBC cell lines MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468 and MDA-MB-453. Results Significant antitumor activity was seen in all cell lines, with differential responses noted in cell-line specific manner. Treatment with PP resulted in significant cytotoxicity, decreased invasion, migration and increased apoptosis in all cell lines tested. Up-regulation of Bax and cleaved PARP and down-regulation of Bcl-2, survivin, cyclin D1 and caspase 3 were noted in PP-treated breast cancer cells. The antitumor effect of PP appeared related to its ability to inhibit the phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) with cytoplasmic accumulation. PP treatment also down-regulated FOXM1 which resulted in a reversal of EMT. Similar results were obtained after silencing of NF-kB and FOXM1. Conclusion Altogether, these studies show, for the first time the antitumor activity of PP against breast cancer cells, in particular TNBC cells. Furthermore, it highlights the concept that optimal treatment of TNBC warrants attention to the differential sensitivity of various TNBC subtypes to therapeutic agents. These results suggest that the PP may be a potentially effective chemopreventive or therapeutic agent against breast cancer. However, additional studies are required to more fully elucidate the mechanism of antitumor effect of PP."
2019,Computer-aided diagnosis system for breast ultrasound images using deep learning,"The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the classification of malignant and benign masses in the breast using ultrasonography based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. We explored the regions for the correct classification by generating a heat map that presented the important regions used by the CNN for human malignancy/benign classification. Clinical data was obtained from a large-scale clinical trial previously conducted by the Japan Association of Breast and Thyroid Sonology. Images of 1536 breast masses (897 malignant and 639 benign) confirmed by pathological examinations were collected, with each breast mass captured from various angles using an ultrasound (US) imaging probe. We constructed an ensemble network by combining two CNN models (VGG19 and ResNet152) fine-tuned on balanced training data with augmentation and used the mass-level classification method to enable the CNN to classify a given mass using all views. For an independent test set consisting of 154 masses (77 malignant and 77 benign), our network showed outstanding classification performance with a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% confidence interval 84.5–97.3), a specificity of 87.0% (79.5–94.5), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951 (0.916–0.987) compared to that of the two CNN models. In addition, our study indicated that the breast masses themselves were not detected by the CNN as important regions for correct mass classification. Collectively, this CNN-based CAD system is expected to assist doctors by improving the diagnosis of breast cancer in clinical practice."
2014,Circulating miR-148b and miR-133a as biomarkers for breast cancer detection,"Circulating microRNAs have drawn a great deal of attention as promising novel biomarkers for breast cancer. However, to date, the results are mixed. Here, we performed a three-stage microRNA analysis using plasma samples from breast cancer patients and healthy controls, with efforts taken to address several pitfalls in detection techniques and study design observed in previous studies. In the discovery phase with 122 Caucasian study subjects, we identified 43 microRNAs differentially expressed between breast cancer cases and healthy controls. When those microRNAs were compared with published data from other studies, we identified three microRNAs, including miR-148b, miR-133a and miR-409-3p, whose plasma levels were significantly higher in breast cancer cases than healthy controls and were also significant in previous independent studies. In the validation phase with 50 breast cancer cases and 50 healthy controls, we validated the associations with breast cancer detection for miR-148b and miR-133a (P = 1.5×10−6 and 1.3×10−10, respectively). In the in-vitro study phase, we found that both miR-148b and miR-133a were secreted from breast cancer cell lines, showing their secretory potential and possible tumor origin. Thus, our data suggest that both miR-148b and miR-133a have potential use as biomarkers for breast cancer detection."
2017,Self-Management Intervention for Adult Cancer Survivors After Treatment: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION This study aims to evaluate the effects of self-management interventions (SMIs) for cancer survivors who completed primary treatment. . LITERATURE SEARCH Using PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL®, PsycINFO®, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trails (CENTRAL), the authors conducted a systematic search of randomized, controlled trials published in English from database conception through June 2016. . DATA EVALUATION The meta-analysis was conducted with Cochrane Review Manager, version 5.3, and R program, version 3.3.1.. SYNTHESIS 12 studies were systematically reviewed for self-management content, mode of delivery, session composition, and type of self-management skills used. Then, a meta-analysis of nine randomized, controlled trials involving 2,804 participants was conducted comparing SMIs with usual care, attention control, and a waitlist group. Qualitative synthesis showed that (a) the major study population was comprised of breast cancer survivors; (b) SMIs focused on medical/behavioral and emotional management; (c) the most common mode of delivery was web-based; and (d) the most frequently evaluated outcomes were depression, self-efficacy, and health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Quantitative results demonstrated a significant medium effect on HRQOL and a large effect on fatigue of borderline significance. The effects on anxiety, depression, and self-efficacy were not statistically significant. . CONCLUSIONS SMIs had a significant medium effect on HRQOL for cancer survivors post-treatment, but the findings should be interpreted with caution because of substantial heterogeneity. In addition, the small number of studies limits conclusions. . IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING SMI as a nursing intervention for improving HRQOL of cancer survivors can be recommended, but more research should be undertaken to determine the most effective SMI format in terms of type, mode of delivery, and session composition."
2023,Quantum Machine Learning: A Review and Case Studies,"Despite its undeniable success, classical machine learning remains a resource-intensive process. Practical computational efforts for training state-of-the-art models can now only be handled by high speed computer hardware. As this trend is expected to continue, it should come as no surprise that an increasing number of machine learning researchers are investigating the possible advantages of quantum computing. The scientific literature on Quantum Machine Learning is now enormous, and a review of its current state that can be comprehended without a physics background is necessary. The objective of this study is to present a review of Quantum Machine Learning from the perspective of conventional techniques. Departing from giving a research path from fundamental quantum theory through Quantum Machine Learning algorithms from a computer scientist’s perspective, we discuss a set of basic algorithms for Quantum Machine Learning, which are the fundamental components for Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. We implement the Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs) on a quantum computer to recognize handwritten digits, and compare its performance to that of its classical counterpart, the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Additionally, we implement the QSVM on the breast cancer dataset and compare it to the classical SVM. Finally, we implement the Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) and many classical classifiers on the Iris dataset to compare their accuracies."
2016,Cardiovascular disease in cancer survivors,"Certain cancer therapies, including radiation therapy and some types of chemotherapies, are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and events. Some of these effects such as those presented by anthracyclines, radiation therapy, cisplatin, as well as those presented by hormone therapy for breast cancer—usually taken for many years for some breast and prostate cancers—are long-lasting and associated with cardiovascular events risk more than 20 years after cancer treatment. Cardiovascular testing, diagnostic assessment of suspected cardiovascular symptomatology, as well as laboratory tests for CVD risk factors are imperative. The early recognition and treatment of CVD processes that arise in survivorship years is pivotal, with specific attention to some CVD processes with specific suggested treatment modalities. Preventive measures include adequate screening, the use of medications such as ACE inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or beta blockers, statin therapy and aspirin in persons who warrant these medications, as well as therapeutic lifestyle modifications such as exercise/physical activity, weight loss and appropriate diet for a healthy lifestyle. Periodic follow-up with a good primary care physician who understands the risks associated with cancer therapy is important, and referral to onco-cardiology for further management of cardiovascular risk in these survivors is based on a patient's cardiovascular risk level and the type, amount and duration of cancer therapies received during the patient's lifetime."
2022,Effective Image Processing and Segmentation-Based Machine Learning Techniques for Diagnosis of Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death among women, behind only heart disease. However, despite the high incidence and mortality rates associated with breast cancer, it is still unclear as to what is responsible for its development in the first place. The prevention of breast cancer is not possible with any of the current available methods. Patients who are diagnosed and treated for breast cancer at an early stage have a better chance of having a successful treatment and recovery. In the field of breast cancer detection, digital mammography is widely acknowledged to be a highly effective method of detecting the disease early on. We may be able to improve early detection of breast cancer with the use of image processing techniques, thereby boosting our chances of survival and treatment success. This article discusses a breast cancer image processing and machine learning framework that was developed. The input data set for this framework is a sequence of mammography images, which are used as input data. The CLAHE approach is then utilized to improve the overall quality of the photographs by means of image processing. It is called contrast restricted adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE), and it is an improvement on the original histogram equalization technique. This aids in the removal of noise from photographs while simultaneously improving picture quality. The segmentation of images is the next step in the framework's development. An image is divided into distinct portions at this point because the pixels are labeled at this step. This assists in the identification of objects and the delineation of boundaries. To categorize these preprocessed images, techniques such as fuzzy SVM, Bayesian classifier, and random forest are employed, among others."
2018,Cancer-Related Cognitive Impairment in Breast Cancer Patients: Influences of Psychological Variables,"Approximately 3.1 million women in the US are living with breast cancer and up to 75% of these women experience cancer-related cognitive impairment (CRCI). CRCI is described as impairments in memory, verbal fluency, thought processes, and attention span. Despite the high prevalence of breast cancer, only a few studies have been published on CRCI and most of these studies primarily focused on its pathophysiological mechanism. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that breast cancer patients with CRCI are more likely to have high level of psychologic distress, suggesting a possible relationship between CRCI and psychologic distress. This review aims to examine existing literature that describes CRCI in relation to psychological distress among breast cancer patients. One thousand four hundred and ninety-eight articles were searched using PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Thirteen studies met inclusion criteria, and one article was additionally pulled from article reference lists. Of these19 studies, psychologic distress has been operationalized in varied ways such as anxiety (n = 3), depression (n = 2), both anxiety and depression (n = 4), stress (n = 4), worry (n = 2), mental fatigue (n = 1), and undefined psychological distress (n = 2). Except for six studies designed as a longitudinal study, the rest of studies used a cross-sectional design. Twelve studies used both subjective and objective measures to assess cognitive function. We found that the patients with high psychological distress displayed lower performance on cognitive function tests. Our finding indicates that psychological variables contributed to CRCI that breast cancer patients experienced. Areas for further investigation are proposed that will advance the care of breast cancer patients with CRCI."
2015,Characterization and Biological Potency of Mono- to Tetra-Halogenated Carbazoles.,"This paper deals with the characterization and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) agonist activities of a series of chlorinated, brominated, and mixed bromo/chlorocarbazoles, some of which have been identified in various environmental samples. Attention is directed here to the possibility that halogenated carbazoles may currently be emitted into the environment as a result of the production of carbazole-containing polymers present in a wide variety of electronic devices. We have found that any carbazole that is not substituted in the 1,3,6,8 positions may be lost during cleanup of environmental extracts if a multilayer column is utilized, as is common practice for polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin (dioxin) and related compounds. In the present study, (1)H NMR spectral shift data for 11 relevant halogenated carbazoles are reported, along with their gas chromatographic separation and analysis by mass spectrometry. These characterization data allow for confident structural assignments and the derivation of possible correlations between structure and toxicity based on the halogenation patterns of the isomers investigated. Some halogenated carbazoles exhibit characteristics of persistent organic pollutants and their potential dioxin-like activity was further investigated. The structure-dependent induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 gene expression in Ah-responsive MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells by these carbazoles was similar to that observed for other dioxin-like compounds, and the magnitude of the fold induction responses for the most active halogenated carbazoles was similar to that observed for 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD). 2,3,6,7-Tetrachlorocarbazole was one of the most active halogenated carbazoles and, like TCDD, contains 4 lateral substituents; however, the estimated relative effect potency for this compound (compared to TCDD) was 0.0001 and 0.0032, based on induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 mRNA, respectively."
2019,Analysis of Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm in the Classification of Breast Cancer,"Objective: The death rate of breast tumour is falling as there is progress in its research area. However, it is the most common disease among women. It is a great challenge in designing a machine learning model to evaluate the performance of the classification of breast tumour. Methods: Implementing an efficient classification methodology will support in resolving the complications in analyzing breast cancer. This proposed model employs two machine learning (ML) algorithms for the categorization of breast tumour; Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) algorithm is used for the breast tumour classification. Result: This classification includes the two levels of disease as benign or malignant. These two machine learning algorithms are verified using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset after feature selection using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The comparison of these two ML algorithms is done using the standard performance metrics. Conclusion: The comparative analysis results indicate that the KNN classifier outperforms the result of the decision-tree classifier in the breast cancer classification."
2019,Long Non-Coding RNA and Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer, one of the most common diseases among women, is regarded as a heterogeneous and complicated disease that remains a major public health concern. Recently, owing to the development of next-generation sequencing technologies, long non-coding RNAs have received extensive attention. Numerous studies reveal that long non-coding RNAs are playing important roles in tumor development. Although the biological function and molecular mechanisms of long non-coding RNAs remain enigmatic, recent researchers have demonstrated that an array of long non-coding RNAs express abnormally in cancers, including breast cancer. Herein, we summarized the latest literature about long non-coding RNAs in breast cancer, with a particular focus on the multiple molecular roles of regulatory long non-coding RNAs that regulate cell proliferation, invasion, metastasis, and apoptosis."
2021,Deep CNN Model based on VGG16 for Breast Cancer Classification,"Deep learning (DL) technologies are becoming a buzzword these days, especially for breast histopathology image tasks, such as diagnosing, due to the high performance obtained in image classification. Among deep learning types, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are the most common types of DL models utilized for medical image diagnosis and analysis. However, CNN suffers from high computation cost to be implemented and may require to adapt huge number of parameters. Thus, and in order to address this issue; several pre-trained models have been established with the predefined network architecture. In this study, a transfer learning model based on Visual Geometry Group with 16-layer deep model architecture (VGG16) is utilized to extract high-level features from the BreaKHis benchmark histopathological images dataset. Then, multiple machine learning models (classifiers) are used to handle different Breast Cancer (BC) histopathological image classification tasks mainly: binary and multiclass with eight-class classifications. The experimental results on the public BreakHis benchmark dataset demonstrate that the proposed models are better than the previous works on the same dataset. Besides, the results show that the proposed models are able to outperform recent classical machine learning algorithms."
2020,Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning,"Breast cancer may be a prevalent explanation for death, and it's the sole sort of cancer that's widespread among women worldwide. The prime objective of this paper creates the model for predicting breast cancer using various machine learning classification algorithms like k Nearest Neighbor (kNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB). And furthermore, assess and compare the performance of the varied classifiers as far as accuracy, precision, recall, f1-Score, and Jaccard index. The breast cancer dataset is publicly available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository and therefore the implementation phase dataset is going to be partitioned as 80% for the training phase and 20% for the testing phase then apply the machine learning algorithms. k Nearest Neighbors achieved a significant performance in respect of all parameters."
2017,Polyphenols as Promising Drugs against Main Breast Cancer Signatures,"Breast cancer is one of the most common neoplasms worldwide, and in spite of clinical and pharmacological advances, it is still a clinical problem, causing morbidity and mortality. On the one hand, breast cancer shares with other neoplasms some molecular signatures such as an imbalanced redox state, cell cycle alterations, increased proliferation and an inflammatory status. On the other hand, breast cancer shows differential molecular subtypes that determine its prognosis and treatment. These are characterized mainly by hormone receptors especially estrogen receptors (ERs) and epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Tumors with none of these receptors are classified as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and are associated with a worse prognosis. The success of treatments partially depends on their specificity and the adequate molecular classification of tumors. New advances in anticancer drug discovery using natural compounds have been made in the last few decades, and polyphenols have emerged as promising molecules. They may act on various molecular targets because of their promiscuous behavior, presenting several physiological effects, some of which confer antitumor activity. This review analyzes the accumulated evidence of the antitumor effects of plant polyphenols on breast cancer, with special attention to their activity on ERs and HER2 targets and also covering different aspects such as redox balance, uncontrolled proliferation and chronic inflammation."
2022,Spatial Transcriptomics Prediction from Histology jointly through Transformer and Graph Neural Networks,"The rapid development of spatial transcriptomics allows for the measurement of RNA abundance at a high spatial resolution, making it possible to simultaneously profile gene expression, spatial locations, and the corresponding hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology images. Since histology images are relatively easy and cheap to obtain, it is promising to leverage histology images for predicting gene expression. Though several methods have been devised to predict gene expression using histology images, they don’t simultaneously include the 2D vision features and the spatial dependency, limiting their performances. Here, we have developed Hist2ST, a deep learning-based model using histology images to predict RNA-seq expression. At each sequenced spot, the corresponding histology image is cropped into an image patch, from which 2D vision features are learned through convolutional operations. Meanwhile, the spatial relations with the whole image and neighbored patches are captured through Transformer and graph neural network modules, respectively. These learned features are then used to predict the gene expression by following the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution. To alleviate the impact by the small spatial transcriptomics data, a self-distillation mechanism is employed for efficient learning of the model. Hist2ST was tested on the HER2-positive breast cancer and the cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma datasets, and shown to outperform existing methods in terms of both gene expression prediction and following spatial region identification. Further pathway analyses indicated that our model could reserve biological information. Thus, Hist2ST enables generating spatial transcriptomics data from histology images for elucidating molecular signatures of tissues."
2017,In Situ Electrodeposited Synthesis of Electrochemiluminescent Ag Nanoclusters as Signal Probe for Ultrasensitive Detection of Cyclin-D1 from Cancer Cells.,"Metal nanoclusters (NCs) as a new type of electrochemiluminescence (ECL) nanomaterials have attracted great attention, but their applications are limited due to relatively low luminescent efficiency and a complex preparation process. Herein, an ultrasensitive ECL biosensor for the detection of Cyclin-D1 (CCND1) was designed by utilizing in situ electrogenerated silver nanoclusters (AgNCs) as ECL emitters and Fe3O4-CeO2 nanocomposites as a coreaction accelerator. The ECL luminous efficiency of AgNCs on the electrode could be significantly enhanced with the use of the Fe3O4-CeO2 for accelerating the reduction of S2O82- to generate the strong oxidizing intermediate radical SO4•-. As a result, the assay for CCND1 detection achieved excellent sensitivity with a linear range from 50 fg/mL to 50 ng/mL and limit of detection down to 28 fg/mL. Impressively, the efficiency of Traditional Chinese Medicines (TCM), sophorae, toward MCF-7 cells was successfully investigated due to the overexpression of CCND1 in relation to the growth and metastasis of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells. In general, the proposed strategy provided an effective method for anticancer drug screening and expanded the application of metal NCs in ultrasensitive biodetection."
2018,Research on Logistic Regression Algorithm of Breast Cancer Diagnose Data by Machine Learning,"If machine learning can automatically identify cancer cells, it will provide considerable benefits to the medical system. The process of automation is likely to improve the efficiency of the detection process, and it may also provide higher detection accuracy by removing the internal subjective human factors in the process. Starting from the measurement data of biopsy cells in women with abnormal breast masses, logistic regression algorithm is applied to study the efficiency of machine learning for cancer detection. In this paper, the LogisticRegression algorithm of Sklearn machine learning library is used to classify the data sets of breast cancer (diagnosis). The classification results show that when the two features of maximum texture and maximum perimeter are selected, the classification accuracy is 96.5%, which is improved compared with the previous methods."
2017,Novel Strategies on Personalized Medicine for Breast Cancer Treatment: An Update,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer type among women worldwide. With breast cancer patients and survivors being reported to experience a repertoire of symptoms that are detrimental to their quality of life, the development of breast cancer treatment strategies that are effective with minimal side effects is therefore required. Personalized medicine, the treatment process that is tailored to the individual needs of each patient, is recently gaining increasing attention for its prospect in the development of effective cancer treatment regimens. Indeed, recent studies have identified a number of genes and molecules that may be used as biomarkers for predicting drug response and severity of common cancer-associated symptoms. These would provide useful clues not only for the determination of the optimal drug choice/dosage to be used in personalized treatment, but also for the identification of gene or molecular targets for the development of novel symptom management strategies, which ultimately would lead to the development of more personalized therapies for effective cancer treatment. In this article, recent studies that would provide potential new options for personalized therapies for breast cancer patients and survivors are reviewed. We suggest novel strategies, including the optimization of drug choice/dosage and the identification of genetic changes that are associated with cancer symptom occurrence and severity, which may help in enhancing the effectiveness and acceptability of the currently available cancer therapies."
2021,Research trends in pharmacological modulation of tumor‐associated macrophages,"Abstract As one of the most abundant immune cell populations in the tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor‐associated macrophages (TAMs) play important roles in multiple solid malignancies, including breast cancer, prostate cancer, liver cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, and colorectal cancer. TAMs could contribute to carcinogenesis, neoangiogenesis, immune‐suppressive TME remodeling, cancer chemoresistance, recurrence, and metastasis. Therefore, reprogramming of the immune‐suppressive TAMs by pharmacological approaches has attracted considerable research attention in recent years. In this review, the promising pharmaceutical targets, as well as the existing modulatory strategies of TAMs were summarized. The chemokine–chemokine receptor signaling, tyrosine kinase receptor signaling, metabolic signaling, and exosomal signaling have been highlighted in determining the biological functions of TAMs. Besides, both preclinical research and clinical trials have suggested the chemokine–chemokine receptor blockers, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, bisphosphonates, as well as the exosomal or nanoparticle‐based targeting delivery systems as the promising pharmacological approaches for TAMs deletion or reprogramming. Lastly, the combined therapies of TAMs‐targeting strategies with traditional treatments or immunotherapies as well as the exosome‐like nanovesicles for cancer therapy are prospected."
2020,Boosted EfficientNet: Detection of Lymph Node Metastases in Breast Cancer Using Convolutional Neural Networks,"Simple Summary The assistance of computer image analysis that automatically identifies tissue or cell types has greatly improved histopathologic interpretation and diagnosis accuracy. In this paper, the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been adapted to predict and classify lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. We observe that image resolutions of lymph node metastasis datasets in breast cancer usually are quite smaller than the designed model input resolution, which defects the performance of the proposed model. To mitigate this problem, we propose a boosted CNN architecture and a novel data augmentation method called Random Center Cropping (RCC). Different from traditional image cropping methods only suitable for resolution images in large scale, RCC not only enlarges the scale of datasets but also preserves the resolution and the center area of images. In addition, the downsampling scale of the network is diminished to be more suitable for small resolution images. Furthermore, we introduce attention and feature fusion mechanisms to enhance the semantic information of image features extracted by CNN. Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of fundamental CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96% ± 0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68% ± 0.01% in Rectified Patch Camelyon (RPCam) datasets, respectively. Abstract (1) Purpose: To improve the capability of EfficientNet, including developing a cropping method called Random Center Cropping (RCC) to retain the original image resolution and significant features on the images’ center area, reducing the downsampling scale of EfficientNet to facilitate the small resolution images of RPCam datasets, and integrating attention and Feature Fusion (FF) mechanisms with EfficientNet to obtain features containing rich semantic information. (2) Methods: We adopt the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect and classify lymph node metastasis in breast cancer. (3) Results: Experiments illustrate that our methods significantly boost performance of basic CNN architectures, where the best-performed method achieves an accuracy of 97.96% ± 0.03% and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.68% ± 0.01% on RPCam datasets, respectively. (4) Conclusions: (1) To our limited knowledge, we are the only study to explore the power of EfficientNet on Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) classification, and elaborate experiments are conducted to compare the performance of EfficientNet with other state-of-the-art CNN models. It might provide inspiration for researchers who are interested in image-based diagnosis using Deep Learning (DL). (2) We design a novel data augmentation method named RCC to promote the data enrichment of small resolution datasets. (3) All of our four technological improvements boost the performance of the original EfficientNet."
2017,Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) Tumor Expression Is Associated with a Better Prognosis and Diabetic Disease in Triple Negative Breast Cancer Patients,"Triple Negative Breast Cancers (TNBC) subtype is an aggressive disease with poor clinical outcome. The only treatment available is surgery followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) is a trans-membrane protein expressed on a wide variety of cells including immune cells, epithelial and vascular endothelial cells. Recently, PD-1/PD-L1 pathway signaling was described as an adaptive immune resistance mechanism enacted by the tumor cells to evade the immune response. Its presence on tumor cell membranes, acquired for this reason, through time, is an important prognostic value. However, data available in the literature about PD-L1 immunohistochemical expression in breast cancer are often discordant and not uniform, probably for the use of different antibodies clones and the high molecular heterogeneity of the different tumor types. The absence of target therapies, in particular for TNBC, has shifted the clinical attention mainly on the role of PD-L1 in this subtype of breast cancer. In this study, we evaluated tumor and TIL (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) PDL-1 expression in a series of TNBC, included in Tissue Micro Arrays (TMAs), to define its real prognostic value, optimizing immunohistochemistry method with an “approved for diagnostic assay” antibody. PD-L1 expression directly correlated with proliferation index (Ki-67), glycemia, the presence of diabetes and indirectly with menopausal status, presence of lymph node metastasis and relapse. The analysis of Kaplan–Meier showed that an increased PD-L1 expression was strongly associated with better disease-free survival (DFS) but not correlated with overall survival (OS). Our data confirmed that PD-L1 could be an important marker for prognostic stratification and for planning immune checkpoint inhibitors therapies in patients with TNBC."
2016,An initial investigation on developing a new method to predict short-term breast cancer risk based on deep learning technology,"In order to establish a new personalized breast cancer screening paradigm, it is critically important to accurately predict the short-term risk of a woman having image-detectable cancer after a negative mammographic screening. In this study, we developed and tested a novel short-term risk assessment model based on deep learning method. During the experiment, a number of 270 “prior” negative screening cases was assembled. In the next sequential (“current”) screening mammography, 135 cases were positive and 135 cases remained negative. These cases were randomly divided into a training set with 200 cases and a testing set with 70 cases. A deep learning based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme was then developed for the risk assessment, which consists of two modules: adaptive feature identification module and risk prediction module. The adaptive feature identification module is composed of three pairs of convolution-max-pooling layers, which contains 20, 10, and 5 feature maps respectively. The risk prediction module is implemented by a multiple layer perception (MLP) classifier, which produces a risk score to predict the likelihood of the woman developing short-term mammography-detectable cancer. The result shows that the new CAD-based risk model yielded a positive predictive value of 69.2% and a negative predictive value of 74.2%, with a total prediction accuracy of 71.4%. This study demonstrated that applying a new deep learning technology may have significant potential to develop a new short-term risk predicting scheme with improved performance in detecting early abnormal symptom from the negative mammograms."
2015,On-Chip Immunoelectrophoresis of Extracellular Vesicles Released from Human Breast Cancer Cells,"Extracellular vesicles (EVs) including exosomes and microvesicles have attracted considerable attention in the fields of cell biology and medicine. For a better understanding of EVs and further exploration of their applications, the development of analytical methods for biological nanovesicles has been required. In particular, considering the heterogeneity of EVs, methods capable of measuring individual vesicles are desired. Here, we report that on-chip immunoelectrophoresis can provide a useful method for the differential protein expression profiling of individual EVs. Electrophoresis experiments were performed on EVs collected from the culture supernatant of MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells using a measurement platform comprising a microcapillary electrophoresis chip and a laser dark-field microimaging system. The zeta potential distribution of EVs that reacted with an anti-human CD63 (exosome and microvesicle marker) antibody showed a marked positive shift as compared with that for the normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) isotype control. Thus, on-chip immunoelectrophoresis could sensitively detect the over-expression of CD63 glycoproteins on EVs. Moreover, to explore the applicability of on-chip immunoelectrophoresis to cancer diagnosis, EVs collected from the blood of a mouse tumor model were analyzed by this method. By comparing the zeta potential distributions of EVs after their immunochemical reaction with normal IgG, and the anti-human CD63 and anti-human CD44 (cancer stem cell marker) antibodies, EVs of tumor origin circulating in blood were differentially detected in the real sample. The result indicates that the present method is potentially applicable to liquid biopsy, a promising approach to the low-invasive diagnosis of cancer."
2018,Gloriosa superba Mediated Synthesis of Platinum and Palladium Nanoparticles for Induction of Apoptosis in Breast Cancer,"Green chemistry approaches for designing therapeutically significant nanomedicine have gained considerable attention in the past decade. Herein, we report for the first time on anticancer potential of phytogenic platinum nanoparticles (PtNPs) and palladium nanoparticles (PdNPs) using a medicinal plant Gloriosa superba tuber extract (GSTE). The synthesis of the nanoparticles was completed within 5 hours at 100°C which was confirmed by development of dark brown and black colour for PtNPs and PdNPs, respectively, along with enhancement of the peak intensity in the UV-visible spectra. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) showed that the monodispersed spherical nanoparticles were within a size range below 10 nm. Energy dispersive spectra (EDS) confirmed the elemental composition, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) helped to evaluate the hydrodynamic size of the particles. Anticancer activity against MCF-7 (human breast adenocarcinoma) cell lines was evaluated using MTT assay, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy. PtNPs and PdNPs showed 49.65 ± 1.99% and 36.26 ± 0.91% of anticancer activity. Induction of apoptosis was most predominant in the underlying mechanism which was rationalized by externalization of phosphatidyl serine and membrane blebbing. These findings support the efficiency of phytogenic fabrication of nanoscale platinum and palladium drugs for management and therapy against breast cancer."
2021,Safe and Targeted Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy Using Biocompatible Exosome-Based Nanosonosensitizers.,"Sonodynamic therapy (SDT), wherein sonosensitizers irradiated with ultrasound (US) produce cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS), has garnered great attention as a promising alternative to photodynamic therapy owing to the significantly increased depth of tissue penetration. The development of nanocarriers that can selectively deposit sonosensitizers into tumor tissues without systemic toxicity is crucial to facilitate the translation of SDT to clinical use. In this study, exosomes, a class of naturally occurring nanoparticles, were utilized as nanocarriers for safe and cancer-targeted delivery of a sonosensitizer, indocyanine green (ICG). The exosomes were surface-engineered with an active cancer-targeting ligand, folic acid (FA), to increase the cancer specificity of the ICG-loaded exosomes (ExoICG). The FA-conjugated, ICG-loaded exosomes (FA-ExoICG) greatly improved aqueous stability and cellular uptake of ICG, resulting in significantly increased ROS generation in breast cancer cells. As a result, the FA-ExoICG demonstrated greater sonotoxicity against cancer cells than ExoICG and free ICG. The in vivo study revealed that compared to ExoICG, more FA-ExoICG accumulated in tumors, and their pharmacokinetic properties were superior. Notably, tumor growth in mice was significantly suppressed, without systemic toxicity, by a single intravenous injection of the FA-ExoICG and subsequent US irradiation. Therefore, this study demonstrated that active cancer-targeted FA-ExoICG could serve as effective nanosonosensitizers for safe and targeted cancer treatment."
2017,Concomitant psychiatric symptoms and impaired quality of life in women with cervical cancer: a critical review,"Our aim was to summarize the current relevant literature on concomitant psychiatric symptoms with a focus on anxiety/depression in a population with gynecologic cancer; to identify the predictors, associated factors, and prevention strategies of psychiatric disorders; to examine psychiatric disorders in a population with recurrent gynecologic cancer; and to describe the limitations of the literature and future research areas. Little is known about attending psychiatric disorders in patients with gynecologic and other malignant diseases like cervical or breast cancer. However, patients suffering from other types of gynecologic cancer (eg, genital/cervical cancer) may also have an increased risk of psychiatric symptoms. In this review, we identify the potential information deficits in this field. A two-rater independent literature search was conducted using the PubMed/Google Scholar search engines to systematically evaluate the literature on the research objectives, followed by a critical reflection on the results. Of the 77 screened studies, 15 met the criteria for inclusion in this review. Patients with gynecologic malignancies, especially cervical cancer, had a very high prevalence of psychiatric symptoms including depression (33%–52%). Additionally, the risk groups facing higher rates of concomitant reduced quality of life and increased psychiatric symptoms such as depression were identified. Specifically, low socioeconomic status, sexual inactivity, absence of a partner, and physical symptoms were correlated with an increased risk. Patients suffering from recurrent gynecologic cancer should receive particular attention because of their significantly increased risk of depressive symptoms. Screening programs are needed to detect psychiatric symptoms in cervical cancer patients and the associated high-risk groups. Regular screening should be implemented, and psychosocial care should be provided during follow-up."
2021,Breast Cancer Segmentation Methods: Current Status and Future Potentials,"Early breast cancer detection is one of the most important issues that need to be addressed worldwide as it can help increase the survival rate of patients. Mammograms have been used to detect breast cancer in the early stages; if detected in the early stages, it can drastically reduce treatment costs. The detection of tumours in the breast depends on segmentation techniques. Segmentation plays a significant role in image analysis and includes detection, feature extraction, classification, and treatment. Segmentation helps physicians quantify the volume of tissue in the breast for treatment planning. In this work, we have grouped segmentation methods into three groups: classical segmentation that includes region-, threshold-, and edge-based segmentation; machine learning segmentation; and supervised and unsupervised and deep learning segmentation. The findings of our study revealed that region-based segmentation is frequently used for classical methods, and the most frequently used techniques are region growing. Further, a median filter is a robust tool for removing noise. Moreover, the MIAS database is frequently used in classical segmentation methods. Meanwhile, in machine learning segmentation, unsupervised machine learning methods are more frequently used, and U-Net is frequently used for mammogram image segmentation because it does not require many annotated images compared with other deep learning models. Furthermore, reviewed papers revealed that it is possible to train a deep learning model without performing any preprocessing or postprocessing and also showed that the U-Net model is frequently used for mammogram segmentation. The U-Net model is frequently used because it does not require many annotated images and also because of the presence of high-performance GPU computing, which makes it easy to train networks with more layers. Additionally, we identified mammograms and utilised widely used databases, wherein 3 and 28 are public and private databases, respectively."
2015,Relevance of Machine Learning Approach in Analysing Metabolomic Data to gain insights on Comorbidity issues in COPD & Asthma,"M adaption of tumour cells is necessary to meet biosynthesis and energy needs of a growing cancer. The energy sensing kinase AMPK is responsible for maintaining AMP/ATP ratio, serving as a metabolic checkpoint that is activated when phosphorylated by the LKB1, a tumour suppressor kinase. LKB1 is frequently found mutated in numerous cancers including 31% of HER2 breast cancer. In our LKB1-/-NIC model, loss of LKB1 expression resulted in reduced tumour latency where tumours were biochemically characterized as hyperactive mTOR, along with metabolic changes characteristic of Warburg effect, namely elevated ATP, LDH, PDH expression and enhanced lactate. Based on these finding, we conducted a pre-clinical studies to evaluate novel combinatorial therapies on tumourigenesis. We report that targeting PI3K-p70S6K pathways with competitive NVP-BEZ235 inhibitor was not as effective at reducing tumourigenesis as targeting mTOR and glycolysis with AZD8055 and 2-DG monotherapies, respectively. Interestingly, simultaneous inhibition of these pathways with AZD8055/2-DG combination was significantly more effective at reducing mitochondria function, tumour volume and burden, culminating in reduced tumourigenesis. At the molecular level, combination treatment inhibited both mTOR signalling and blocked MAPK survival signalling that is responsible for ERK-p90RSK pathway engagement. Finally, loss of LKB1 expression in cancers should be considered a marker for metabolic dysfunction given the role LKB1 plays in regulating both AMPK activity and mTOR function. The results of our pre-clinical studies suggest that combinatorial therapy that target mTORC1/ mTORC2 and glycolytic pathways in cancer, is critical for inhibiting tumour growth. Importantly, our discovery showed that the drug combination inhibited the activation of feedback loops that are drivers of resistance, namely ERK and p90RSK. We believe that simultaneous targeting of these pathways will provide the best clinical outcome for the treatment of metabolically active cancers, as well as reduce the likelihood of recurrence."
2021,Preprocessing of Breast Cancer Images to Create Datasets for Deep-CNN,"Breast cancer is the most diagnosed cancer in Australia with crude incidence rates increasing drastically from 62.8 at ages 35–39 to 271.4 at ages 50–54 (cases per 100,000 women). Various researchers have proposed methods and tools based on Machine Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks for assessing mammographic images, but these methods have produced detection and interpretation errors resulting in false-positive and false-negative cases when used in the real world. We believe that this problem can potentially be resolved by implementing effective image pre-processing techniques to create training data for Deep-CNN. Therefore, the main aim of this research is to propose effective image pre-processing methods to create datasets that can save computational time for the neural network and improve accuracy and classification rates. To do so, this research proposes methods for background removal, pectoral muscle removal, adding noise to the images, and image enhancements. Adding noise without affecting the quality of details in the images makes the input images for the neural network more representative, which may improve the performance of the neural network model when used in the real world. The proposed method for background removal is the “Rolling Ball Algorithm” and “Huang’s Fuzzy Thresholding”, which succeed in removing background from 100% of the images. For pectoral muscle removal “Canny Edge Detection” and “Hough’s Line Transform” are used, which removed muscle from 99.06% of the images. “Invert”, “CTI_RAS” and “ISOCONTOUR” lookup tables (LUTs) were used for image enhancements to outline the ROIs and regions within the ROIs."
2020,Quantifying Explainers of Graph Neural Networks in Computational Pathology,"Explainability of deep learning methods is imperative to facilitate their clinical adoption in digital pathology. However, popular deep learning methods and explainability techniques (explainers) based on pixel-wise processing disregard biological entities’ notion, thus complicating comprehension by pathologists. In this work, we address this by adopting biological entity-based graph processing and graph explainers enabling explanations accessible to pathologists. In this context, a major challenge becomes to discern meaningful explainers, particularly in a standardized and quantifiable fashion. To this end, we propose herein a set of novel quantitative metrics based on statistics of class separability using pathologically measurable concepts to characterize graph explainers. We employ the proposed metrics to evaluate three types of graph explainers, namely the layer-wise relevance propagation, gradient-based saliency, and graph pruning approaches, to explain Cell-Graph representations for Breast Cancer Subtyping. The proposed metrics are also applicable in other domains by using domain-specific intuitive concepts. We validate the qualitative and quantitative findings on the BRACS dataset, a large cohort of breast cancer RoIs, by expert pathologists. The code, data, and models can be accessed here 1."
2016,Microscopic medical image classification framework via deep learning and shearlet transform,"Abstract. Cancer is the second leading cause of death in US after cardiovascular disease. Image-based computer-aided diagnosis can assist physicians to efficiently diagnose cancers in early stages. Existing computer-aided algorithms use hand-crafted features such as wavelet coefficients, co-occurrence matrix features, and recently, histogram of shearlet coefficients for classification of cancerous tissues and cells in images. These hand-crafted features often lack generalizability since every cancerous tissue and cell has a specific texture, structure, and shape. An alternative approach is to use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the most appropriate feature abstractions directly from the data and handle the limitations of hand-crafted features. A framework for breast cancer detection and prostate Gleason grading using CNN trained on images along with the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients is presented. Particularly, we apply shearlet transform on images and extract the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients. Then we feed shearlet features along with the original images to our CNN consisting of multiple layers of convolution, max pooling, and fully connected layers. Our experiments show that using the magnitude and phase of shearlet coefficients as extra information to the network can improve the accuracy of detection and generalize better compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on hand-crafted features. This study expands the application of deep neural networks into the field of medical image analysis, which is a difficult domain considering the limited medical data available for such analysis."
2022,"Artificial Intelligence in Cancer Research: Trends, Challenges and Future Directions","The World Health Organization (WHO), in their 2022 report, identified cancer as one of the leading causes of death, accounting for about 16% of deaths worldwide. The Cancer-Moonshot community aims to reduce the cancer death rate by half in the next 25 years and wants to improve the lives of cancer-affected people. Cancer mortality can be reduced if detected early and treated appropriately. Cancers like breast cancer and cervical cancer have high cure probabilities when treated early in accordance with best practices. Integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into cancer research is currently addressing many of the challenges where medical experts fail to bring cancer to control and cure, and the outcomes are quite encouraging. AI offers many tools and platforms to facilitate more understanding and tackling of this life-threatening disease. AI-based systems can help pathologists in diagnosing cancer more accurately and consistently, reducing the case error rates. Predictive-AI models can estimate the likelihood for a person to get cancer by identifying the risk factors. Big data, together with AI, can enable medical experts to develop customized treatments for cancer patients. The side effects from this kind of customized therapy will be less severe in comparison with the generalized therapies. However, many of these AI tools will remain ineffective in fighting against cancer and saving the lives of millions of patients unless they are accessible and understandable to biologists, oncologists, and other medical cancer researchers. This paper presents the trends, challenges, and future directions of AI in cancer research. We hope that this paper will be of help to both medical experts and technical experts in getting a better understanding of the challenges and research opportunities in cancer diagnosis and treatment."
2021,The Breast Cancer Stem Cells Traits and Drug Resistance,"Drug resistance is a major challenge in breast cancer (BC) treatment at present. Accumulating studies indicate that breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) are responsible for the BC drugs resistance, causing relapse and metastasis in BC patients. Thus, BCSCs elimination could reverse drug resistance and improve drug efficacy to benefit BC patients. Consequently, mastering the knowledge on the proliferation, resistance mechanisms, and separation of BCSCs in BC therapy is extremely helpful for BCSCs-targeted therapeutic strategies. Herein, we summarize the principal BCSCs surface markers and signaling pathways, and list the BCSCs-related drug resistance mechanisms in chemotherapy (CT), endocrine therapy (ET), and targeted therapy (TT), and display therapeutic strategies for targeting BCSCs to reverse drug resistance in BC. Even more importantly, more attention should be paid to studies on BCSC-targeted strategies to overcome the drug resistant dilemma of clinical therapies in the future."
2021,Bibliometric Analysis of Global Research Trends on Ultrasound Microbubble: A Quickly Developing Field,"Background: Microbubbles are widely used as highly effective contrast agents to improve the diagnostic capability of ultrasound imaging. Mounting evidence suggests that ultrasound coupled with microbubbles has promising therapeutic applications in cancer, cardiovascular, and neurological disorders by acting as gene or drug carriers. The aim of this study was to identify the scientific output and activity related to ultrasound microbubble through bibliometric approaches. Methods: The literature related to ultrasound microbubble published between 1998 and 2019 was identified and selected from the Science Citation Index Expanded of Web of Science Core Collection on February 21, 2021. The Scopus database was also searched to validate the results and provided as supplementary material. Quantitative variables including number of publications and citations, H-index, and journal citation reports were analyzed by using Microsoft Excel 2019 and GraphPad Prism 8.0 software. VOS viewer and CiteSpace V were used to perform coauthorship, citation, co-citation, and co-occurrence analysis for countries/regions, institutions, authors, and keywords. Results: A total of 6088 publications from the WoSCC were included. The United States has made the largest contribution in this field, with the majority of publications (2090, 34.3%), citations (90,741, 46.6%), the highest H-index (138), and close collaborations with China and Canada. The most contributive institution was the University of Toronto. Professors De Jong N and Dayton P A have made great achievements in this field. However, the research cooperation between institutions and authors was relatively weak. All the studies could be divided into four clusters: “ultrasound diagnosis study,” “microbubbles’ characteristics study,” “gene therapy study,” and “drug delivery study.” The average appearing years (AAY) of keywords in the cluster “drug delivery study” was more recent than other clusters. For promising hot spots, “doxorubicin” showed a relatively latest AAY of 2015.49, followed by “nanoparticles” and “breast cancer.” Conclusion: There has been an increasing amount of scientific output on ultrasound microbubble according to the global trends, and the United States is staying ahead in this field. Collaboration between research teams still needs to be strengthened. The focus gradually shifts from “ultrasound diagnosis study” to “drug delivery study.” It is recommended to pay attention to the latest hot spots, such as “doxorubicin,” “nanoparticles,” and “breast cancer.”"
2014,Inhibition of Cancer Cell Migration by Gold Nanorods: Molecular Mechanisms and Implications for Cancer Therapy,"Gold nanorods have received much attention because of their distinct physicochemical properties and promising applications in bioimaging, biosensing, drug delivery, photothermal therapy, and optoelectronic devices. However, little is known regarding their effect on tumor metastasis. In the present investigation, serum protein‐coated gold nanorods (AuNRs) at low concentrations is shown to exhibit no apparent effects on the viability and proliferation of three different metastatic cancer cell lines, that is, MDA‐MB‐231 human breast cancer cells, PC3 human prostate cancer cells, and B16F10 mouse melanoma cells, but effectively inhibit their migration and invasion in vitro. Quantitative proteomics and real‐time PCR array analyses indicate that exposure of cells to AuNRs can down‐regulate the expression of diverse energy generation‐related genes, which accounts for their inhibition of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis. The impairment of OXPHOS and glycolysis results in a distinctive reduction of ATP production and subsequent inhibition of F‐actin cytoskeletal assembly, which is crucial for the migration and invasion of cancer cells. The inhibitory effect of AuNRs on cancer cell migration is also confirmed in vivo. Taken together, the unique mechanism in inhibiting cancer cell migration by AuNRs might provide a new approach to specific cancer therapeutic treatment."
2017,Home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes for breast cancer survivors.,"BACKGROUND The prognosis and survival rate of women with breast cancer have significantly improved worldwide. Effective home-based multidimensional programmes for breast cancer survivors have gained an ever greater emphasis in survivorship care to maximise women's quality of life for their successful transition to rehabilitation and normal life. It is important to summarise the best available evidence to evaluate the effects of home-based multidimensional survivorship programmes on quality of life in women within 10 years of the completion of surgery or adjuvant cancer therapy for breast cancer, or both. OBJECTIVES To assess the effects of home-based, multidimensional survivorship (HBMS) programmes on maintaining or improving the quality of life in breast cancer survivors. SEARCH METHODS In April 2016 we searched the Cochrane Breast Cancer Specialised Register, CENTRAL, PubMed, Embase, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) and ClinicalTrials.gov. We also screened reference lists of all identified studies and contacted study authors. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs assessing the effects of HBMS programmes in maintaining or improving quality of life in women with stages 0 to 3 breast cancer who completed primary cancer treatment (surgery or adjuvant cancer therapy, or both) up to 10 years earlier. We considered studies where the interventions included more than one of the following listed components: educational (such as information provision and self-management advice), physical (such as exercise training and resistance training) and psychological (such as counselling and cognitive therapies), to constitute a multidimensional programme. Interventions had to be allowed to be carried out at home. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Two authors independently assessed eligible studies for inclusion, and performed quality assessment and extracted relevant data of the included studies. Quality of life was the primary outcome of the review. MAIN RESULTS We included 22 RCTs and four quasi-RCTs on 2272 participants. We categorised the intervention components into four groups: educational and psychological; educational and physical; physical and psychological; and educational, physical and psychological. Most of the studies used usual care (routine medical follow-up services) as the comparator. A few studies used a lower level or different type of intervention (e.g. stress management or exercise) or attention control as the comparator.We used the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT B), European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life C30 (EORTC C30), Quality of Life (QoL) Breast Cancer, and SF36 questionnaires to assess quality of life. HBMS programmes may increase breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life immediately after the intervention, as measured by FACT-B and EORTC C30 (FACT-B: mean difference (MD) 4.55, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.33 to 6.78, 7 studies, 764 participants; EORTC: MD 4.38, 95% CI 0.11 to 8.64, 6 studies; 299 participants; moderate-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference in quality of life as measured by QoL-Breast Cancer or SF-36 (QoL-Breast Cancer: MD 0.42, 95% CI -0.02 to 0.85, 2 studies, 111 participants, very low-quality evidence; physical composite score SF36: MD 0.55, 95% CI -3.52 to 4.63, 2 studies, 308 participants, low-quality evidence).We observed a similar pattern at one to three months after the intervention: FACT-B (MD 6.10, 95% CI 2.48 to 9.72, 2 studies, 426 participants), EORTC-C30 (MD 6.32, 95% CI 0.61 to 12.04, 2 studies; 172 participants) and QoL-Breast Cancer (MD 0.45, 95% CI -0.19 to 1.09, 1 study, 61 participants). At four to six months and 12 months, there was no evidence of a difference in quality of life between groups (four to six months: EORTC - MD 0.08, 95% CI -7.28 to 7.44, 2 studies; 117 participants; SF-36 - MD -1.05, 95% CI -5.60 to 3.51, 2 studies, 308 participants; 12 months: EORTC - MD 2.04, 95% CI -9.91 to 13.99, 1 study; 57 participants).Functional status was incorporated into the quality of life subscale findings. HBMS programmes may decrease anxiety (MD of Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) -1.01, 95% CI -1.94 to -0.08, 5 studies, 253 participants, low-quality evidence) compared to control immediately after the intervention but the effect did not persist at four to six months. There was no evidence of improvements in depression immediately after HBMS (MD of HADS -1.36, 95% CI -2.94 to 0.22, 4 studies, 213 participants, low-quality evidence) or at follow-up. HBMS programmes may also decrease fatigue (MD -1.11, 95% CI -1.78 to -0.45, 3 studies, 127 participants; low-quality evidence) and insomnia (MD -1.81, 95% CI -3.34 to -0.27, 3 studies, 185 participants, low-quality evidence).None of the included studies reported service needs and utilisation and cost of care, and therefore the effect of HBMS programmes on healthcare utilisation and cost is unknown. Due to the variations in assessment methods of adherence among the eight studies, we could not combine the results for meta-analysis. We synthesised the results narratively, with the reported adherence rates of 58% to 100%. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis revealed that HBMS programmes in breast cancer survivors appear to have a short-term beneficial effect of improving breast cancer-specific quality of life and global quality of life as measured by FACT-B and EORTC-C30, respectively. In addition, HBMS programmes are associated with a reduction in anxiety, fatigue and insomnia immediately after the intervention. We assessed the quality of evidence across studies as moderate for some outcomes, meaning that we are fairly confident about the results, while we assessed other outcomes as being low-quality, meaning that we are uncertain about the result."
2019,Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Transfer Learning and Global Pooling,"Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer-related death in women worldwide. Early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer may significantly increase the survival rate of patients. In this study, we aim to develop a fully automatic, deep learning-based, method using descriptor features extracted by Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) models and pooling operation for the classification of hematoxylin and eosin stain (H#E) histological breast cancer images provided as a part of the International Conference on Image Analysis and Recognition (ICIAR) 2018 Grand Challenge on BreAst Cancer Histology (BACH) Images. Different data augmentation methods are applied to optimize the DCNN performance. We also investigated the efficacy of different stain normalization methods as a pre-processing step. The proposed network architecture using a pre-trained Xception model yields 92.50% average classification accuracy."
2019,Facile synthesis of ZnMn2O4@rGO microspheres for ultrasensitive electrochemical detection of hydrogen peroxide from human breast cancer cells.,"Mixed transition-metal oxides have witnessed increasing attention in catalysts and electrocatalysts. Herein, reduced graphene oxide wrapped ZnMn2O4 microspheres (ZnMn2O4@rGO) were facilely synthesized through solvothermal technique. The microstructure and morphology of ZnMn2O4@rGO microspheres were analyzed under Raman, X-ray photoelectron, X-ray diffraction, energy-dispersive spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The synthesized ZnMn2O4@rGO was employed as excellent electrocatalysts for the reduction of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The ZnMn2O4@rGO modiﬁed glassy carbon electrode (ZnMn2O4@rGO/GCE) exhibited a linear detection to H2O2 in a wide concentration range of 0.03-6000 μM with detection limit of 0.012 μM. The biosensor was evaluated to determine H2O2 secreted by human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), indicating its promising applications in physiology and diagnosis."
2019,Deep Learning Applications in Chest Radiography and Computed Tomography: Current State of the Art,"Deep learning is a genre of machine learning that allows computational models to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction using numerous processing layers. A distinctive feature of deep learning, compared with conventional machine learning methods, is that it can generate appropriate models for tasks directly from the raw data, removing the need for human-led feature extraction. Medical images are particularly suited for deep learning applications. Deep learning techniques have already demonstrated high performance in the detection of diabetic retinopathy on fundoscopic images and metastatic breast cancer cells on pathologic images. In radiology, deep learning has the opportunity to provide improved accuracy of image interpretation and diagnosis. Many groups are exploring the possibility of using deep learning–based applications to solve unmet clinical needs. In chest imaging, there has been a large effort to develop and apply computer-aided detection systems for the detection of lung nodules on chest radiographs and chest computed tomography. The essential limitation to computer-aided detection is an inability to learn from new information. To overcome these deficiencies, many groups have turned to deep learning approaches with promising results. In addition to nodule detection, interstitial lung disease recognition, lesion segmentation, diagnosis and patient outcomes have been addressed by deep learning approaches. The purpose of this review article was to cover the current state of the art for deep learning approaches and its limitations, and some of the potential impact on the field of radiology, with specific reference to chest imaging."
2017,An electrochemical method for the detection of disease-specific exosomes,"Exosomes are cell-derived vesicles secreted by both normal and cancerous cells into the extracellular matrix and in blood circulation. Tumor-derived exosomes have attracted increasing attention in noninvasive cancer diagnosis and prognosis. However, their effective capture and specific detection pose significant technical challenges. Current detection methods largely fail to quantify the tumor-derived exosomes present in the total (bulk) exosome population derived from body fluids of cancer patients. In this proof-of-concept study, we report an electrochemical detection method to directly quantify the disease-specific exosomes present in cell culture media. The assay has a two-step design, where bulk exosome populations are initially captured by using a generic antibody (i.e. tetraspanin biomarker, CD9). Subsequent detection of the cancer-specific exosomes within the captured exosomes was carried out by using a cancer-specific antibody, in this case, a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2) antibody, allowing quantification of HER2-postive, breast-cancer-derived exosomes. This approach exhibits excellent specificity for HER-2(+) BT-474 cell-derived exosomes (detection limit, 4.7×10 exosomes μL) with a relative standard deviation of <4.9 % (n=3). We suggest that this simple and inexpensive electrochemical method could be an alternative for the quantification of exosome subpopulations in specific disease settings for future clinical bioassays."
2014,Influence of Lifestyle Factors on Breast Cancer Risk,"Breast Cancer (BC) is a life-changing event. Compared to other malignancies in women, BC has received considerably more public attention. Despite improved neoadjuvant, adjuvant, and palliative treatment strategies for each characteristic molecular BC subtype, recommendations for evidence-based preventive strategies for BC treatment are not given equivalent attention. This may be partly due to the fact that high-quality long-term prevention studies are still difficult to carry out and are thus underrepresented in international studies. The aim of this review is to discuss the most relevant lifestyle factors associated with BC and to identify and discuss the evidence supporting practical prevention strategies that can be used in everyday clinical practice."
2020,Automated Breast Cancer Detection in Digital Mammograms of Various Densities via Deep Learning,"Mammography plays an important role in screening breast cancer among females, and artificial intelligence has enabled the automated detection of diseases on medical images. This study aimed to develop a deep learning model detecting breast cancer in digital mammograms of various densities and to evaluate the model performance compared to previous studies. From 1501 subjects who underwent digital mammography between February 2007 and May 2015, craniocaudal and mediolateral view mammograms were included and concatenated for each breast, ultimately producing 3002 merged images. Two convolutional neural networks were trained to detect any malignant lesion on the merged images. The performances were tested using 301 merged images from 284 subjects and compared to a meta-analysis including 12 previous deep learning studies. The mean area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) for detecting breast cancer in each merged mammogram was 0.952 ± 0.005 by DenseNet-169 and 0.954 ± 0.020 by EfficientNet-B5, respectively. The performance for malignancy detection decreased as breast density increased (density A, mean AUC = 0.984 vs. density D, mean AUC = 0.902 by DenseNet-169). When patients’ age was used as a covariate for malignancy detection, the performance showed little change (mean AUC, 0.953 ± 0.005). The mean sensitivity and specificity of the DenseNet-169 (87 and 88%, respectively) surpassed the mean values (81 and 82%, respectively) obtained in a meta-analysis. Deep learning would work efficiently in screening breast cancer in digital mammograms of various densities, which could be maximized in breasts with lower parenchyma density."
2015,AN APPROACH FOR BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS CLASSIFICATION USING NEURAL NETWORK,"Artificial neural network has been widely used in various fields as an intelligent tool in recent years, such as artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, medical diagnosis, machine learning and so on. The classification of breast cancer is a medical application that poses a great challenge for researchers and scientists. Recently, the neural network has become a popular tool in the classification of cancer datasets. Classification is one of the most active research and application areas of neural networks. Major disadvantages of artificial neural network (ANN) classifier are due to its sluggish convergence and always being trapped at the local minima. To overcome this problem, differential evolution algorithm (DE) has been used to determine optimal value or near optimal value for ANN parameters. DE has been applied successfully to improve ANN learning from previous studies. However, there are still some issues on DE approach such as longer training time and lower classification accuracy. To overcome these problems, island based model has been proposed in this system. The aim of our study is to propose an approach for breast cancer distinguishing between different classes of breast cancer. This approach is based on the Wisconsin Diagnostic and Prognostic Breast Cancer and the classification of different types of breast cancer datasets. The proposed system implements the island-based training method to be better accuracy and less training time by using and analysing between two different migration topologies."
2021,Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes Prediction by Mammographic Radiomics Features,"Rationale and Objectives: This study aimed to investigate whether quantitative radiomics features extracted from digital mammogram images are associated with molecular subtypes of breast cancer. Materials and Methods: In this institutional review board approved retrospective study, we collected 331 Chinese women who were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in 2015. This cohort included 29 triple-negative, 45 human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, 36 luminal A, and 221 luminal B lesions. A set of 39 quantitative radiomic features, including morphological, gray scale statistic, and texture features, were extracted from the segmented lesion area. Three binary-classifications of the subtypes were performed: triple-negative vs. non-triplenegative, HER2-enriched vs. non-HER2-enriched, and luminal (A+B) vs. non-luminal. The Naive Bayes machine learning scheme was employed for the classification and the least absolute shrink age and selection operator (LASSO) method was used to select most predictive features for the classifiers. Classification performance was evaluated by the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and accuracy.

2018,Diagnostic Accuracy of Different Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Risk Calculation: a Meta-Analysis,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation. Methods A meta-analysis was conducted of published research articles on diagnostic test accuracy of different machine learning algorithms for breast cancer risk calculation published between January 2000 and May 2018 in the online article databases of PubMed, ProQuest and EBSCO. Paired forest plots were employed for the analysis. Numerical values for sensitivity and specificity were obtained from false negative (FN), false positive (FP), true negative (TN) and true positive (TP) rates, presented alongside graphical representations with boxes marking the values and horizontal lines showing the confidence intervals (CIs). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were applied to assess the performance of diagnostic tests. Data were processed using Review Manager 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). Results A total of 1,879 articles were reviewed, of which 11 were selected for systematic review and meta-analysis. Fve algorithms for machine learning able to predict breast cancer risk were identified: Super Vector Machine (SVM); Artificial Neural Networks (ANN); Decision Tree (DT); Naive Bayes (NB); and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN). With the SVM, the Area Under Curve (AUC) from the SROC was > 90%, therefore classified into the excellent category. Conclusion The meta-analysis confirmed that the SVM algorithm is able to calculate breast cancer risk with better accuracy value than other machine learning algorithms."
2018,Antitumor Activity of Extract From the Sporoderm-Breaking Spore of Ganoderma lucidum: Restoration on Exhausted Cytotoxic T Cell With Gut Microbiota Remodeling,"As breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in women population worldwide, ongoing endeavor has been made for alternative regimens with improved efficacy but fewer adverse effects. Recently, active components from the spores of Ganoderma lucidum have attracted much attention for their versatile biological activities owing to the advance in sporoderm-breaking technology. Here, anticancer potential of an extract derived from the sporoderm-breaking spores of G. lucidum (ESG) was explored in a 4T1-breast cancer xenograft mice model. Results showed that ESG was able to suppress 4T1 tumor growth in vivo rather than in vitro. Flowcytometry analysis revealed that ESG could significantly increase both cytotoxic T cell (Tc) population and the ratio of Tc to helper T cell (Th) in peripheral blood of the tumor-bearing mouse; similar promotion on Tc was also found in tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte. Moreover, ESG evidently downregulated the two immune checkpoints, programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1, in the spleen) and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4, in the tumor), suggesting that ESG could effectively restore the T cell paradigm by recovering the exhaustion status via suppressing the co-inhibitory checkpoints. By 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis on the fecal microbiota, it was found that ESG would remodeling the overall structure of the samples from tumor-bearing mice toward that of the normal counterparts, including 18 genera in 5 phyla, together with regulations on several genes that are responsible for signaling pathways involved in metabolism, cellular processes, and environmental information processing. Collectively, this study demonstrated that ESG would serve as a natural anticancer adjuvant via a restoration on the exhausted Tc, highlighting important clinical implications for the treatment of breast cancer."
2018,Use of clinical MRI maximum intensity projections for improved breast lesion classification with deep convolutional neural networks,"Abstract. Deep learning methods have been shown to improve breast cancer diagnostic and prognostic decisions based on selected slices of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). However, incorporation of volumetric and temporal components into DCE-MRIs has not been well studied. We propose maximum intensity projection (MIP) images of subtraction MRI as a way to simultaneously include four-dimensional (4-D) images into lesion classification using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The study was performed on a dataset of 690 cases. Regions of interest were selected around each lesion on three MRI presentations: (i) the MIP image generated on the second postcontrast subtraction MRI, (ii) the central slice of the second postcontrast MRI, and (iii) the central slice of the second postcontrast subtraction MRI. CNN features were extracted from the ROIs using pretrained VGGNet. The features were utilized in the training of three support vector machine classifiers to characterize lesions as malignant or benign. Classifier performances were evaluated with fivefold cross-validation and compared based on area under the ROC curve (AUC). The approach using MIPs [AUC=0.88(se=0.01)] outperformed that using central-slices of either second postcontrast MRIs [0.80(se=0.02)] or second postcontrast subtraction MRIs [AUC=0.84(se=0.02)], at statistically significant levels."
2022,Predicting Breast Cancer from Risk Factors Using SVM and Extra-Trees-Based Feature Selection Method,"Developing a prediction model from risk factors can provide an efficient method to recognize breast cancer. Machine learning (ML) algorithms have been applied to increase the efficiency of diagnosis at the early stage. This paper studies a support vector machine (SVM) combined with an extremely randomized trees classifier (extra-trees) to provide a diagnosis of breast cancer at the early stage based on risk factors. The extra-trees classifier was used to remove irrelevant features, while SVM was utilized to diagnose the breast cancer status. A breast cancer dataset consisting of 116 subjects was utilized by machine learning models to predict breast cancer, while the stratified 10-fold cross-validation was employed for the model evaluation. Our proposed combined SVM and extra-trees model reached the highest accuracy up to 80.23%, which was significantly better than the other ML model. The experimental results demonstrated that by applying extra-trees-based feature selection, the average ML prediction accuracy was improved by up to 7.29% as contrasted to ML without the feature selection method. Our proposed model is expected to increase the efficiency of breast cancer diagnosis based on risk factors. In addition, we presented the proposed prediction model that could be employed for web-based breast cancer prediction. The proposed model is expected to improve diagnostic decision-support systems by predicting breast cancer disease accurately."
2017,Deep learning in breast cancer risk assessment: evaluation of convolutional neural networks on a clinical dataset of full-field digital mammograms,"Abstract. To evaluate deep learning in the assessment of breast cancer risk in which convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with transfer learning are used to extract parenchymal characteristics directly from full-field digital mammographic (FFDM) images instead of using computerized radiographic texture analysis (RTA), 456 clinical FFDM cases were included: a “high-risk” BRCA1/2 gene-mutation carriers dataset (53 cases), a “high-risk” unilateral cancer patients dataset (75 cases), and a “low-risk dataset” (328 cases). Deep learning was compared to the use of features from RTA, as well as to a combination of both in the task of distinguishing between high- and low-risk subjects. Similar classification performances were obtained using CNN [area under the curve (AUC)=0.83; standard error (SE)=0.03] and RTA (AUC=0.82; SE=0.03) in distinguishing BRCA1/2 carriers and low-risk women. However, in distinguishing unilateral cancer patients and low-risk women, performance was significantly greater with CNN (AUC=0.82; SE=0.03) compared to RTA (AUC=0.73; SE=0.03). Fusion classifiers performed significantly better than the RTA-alone classifiers with AUC values of 0.86 and 0.84 in differentiating BRCA1/2 carriers from low-risk women and unilateral cancer patients from low-risk women, respectively. In conclusion, deep learning extracted parenchymal characteristics from FFDMs performed as well as, or better than, conventional texture analysis in the task of distinguishing between cancer risk populations."
2017,Physalis Mottle Virus-Like Particles as Nanocarriers for Imaging Reagents and Drugs.,"Platform technologies based on plant virus nanoparticles (VNPs) and virus-like particles (VLPs) are attracting the attention of researchers and clinicians because the particles are biocompatible, biodegradable, noninfectious in mammals, and can readily be chemically and genetically engineered to carry imaging agents and drugs. When the Physalis mottle virus (PhMV) coat protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, the resulting VLPs are nearly identical to the viruses formed in vivo. Here, we isolated PhMV-derived VLPs from ClearColi cells and carried out external and internal surface modification with fluorophores using reactive lysine-N-hydroxysuccinimide ester and cysteine-maleimide chemistries, respectively. The uptake of dye-labeled particles was tested in a range of cancer cells and monitored by confocal microscopy and flow cytometry. VLPs labeled internally on cysteine residues were taken up with high efficiency by several cancer cell lines and were colocalized with the endolysosomal marker LAMP-1 within 6 h, whereas VLPs labeled externally on lysine residues were taken up with lower efficiency, probably reflecting differences in surface charge and the propensity to bind to the cell surface. The infusion of dye and drug molecules into the cavity of the VLPs revealed that the photosensitizer (PS), Zn-EpPor, and the drugs crystal violet, mitoxantrone (MTX), and doxorubicin (DOX) associated stably with the carrier via noncovalent interactions. We confirmed the cytotoxicity of the PS-PhMV and DOX-PhMV particles against prostate cancer, ovarian and breast cancer cell lines, respectively. Our results show that PhMV-derived VLPs provide a new platform technology for the delivery of imaging agents and drugs, with preferential uptake into cancer cells. These particles could therefore be developed as multifunctional tools for cancer diagnosis and therapy."
2021,Curcumin: Modulator of Key Molecular Signaling Pathways in Hormone-Independent Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among females worldwide. It is a highly heterogeneous disease, classified according to hormone and growth factor receptor expression. Patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) (estrogen receptor-negative/progesterone receptor-negative/human epidermal growth factor receptor (HER2)-negative) and hormone-independent HER2 overexpressing subtypes still represent highly aggressive behavior, metastasis, poor prognosis, and drug resistance. Thus, new alternative anticancer agents based on the use of natural products have been receiving enormous attention. In this regard, curcumin is a promising lead in cancer drug discovery due its ability to modulate a diverse range of molecular targets and signaling pathways. The current review has emphasized the underlying mechanism of curcumin anticancer action mediated through the modulation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR, JAK/STAT, MAPK, NF-ĸB, p53, Wnt/β-catenin, apoptosis, and cell cycle pathways in hormone-independent breast cancer, providing frameworks for future studies and insights to improve its efficiency in clinical practice. Abstract Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. Despite the overall successes in breast cancer therapy, hormone-independent HER2 negative breast cancer, also known as triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), lacking estrogens and progesterone receptors and with an excessive expression of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), along with the hormone-independent HER2 positive subtype, still remain major challenges in breast cancer treatment. Due to their poor prognoses, aggressive phenotype, and highly metastasis features, new alternative therapies have become an urgent clinical need. One of the most noteworthy phytochemicals, curcumin, has attracted enormous attention as a promising drug candidate in breast cancer prevention and treatment due to its multi-targeting effect. Curcumin interrupts major stages of tumorigenesis including cell proliferation, survival, angiogenesis, and metastasis in hormone-independent breast cancer through the modulation of multiple signaling pathways. The current review has highlighted the anticancer activity of curcumin in hormone-independent breast cancer via focusing on its impact on key signaling pathways including the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, JAK/STAT pathway, MAPK pathway, NF-ĸB pathway, p53 pathway, and Wnt/β-catenin, as well as apoptotic and cell cycle pathways. Besides, its therapeutic implications in clinical trials are here presented."
2019,Cardiac Substructure Segmentation with Deep Learning for Improved Cardiac Sparing.,"PURPOSE Radiation dose to cardiac substructures is related to radiation-induced heart disease. However, substructures are not considered in radiation therapy planning (RTP) due to poor visualization on CT. Therefore, we developed a novel deep learning (DL) pipeline leveraging MRI's soft tissue contrast coupled with CT for state-of-the-art cardiac substructure segmentation requiring a single, non-contrast CT input. MATERIALS/METHODS Thirty-two left-sided whole-breast cancer patients underwent cardiac T2 MRI and CT-simulation. A rigid cardiac-confined MR/CT registration enabled ground-truth delineations of 12 substructures (chambers, great vessels (GVs), coronary arteries (CAs), etc.). Paired MRI/CT data (25 patients) were placed into separate image channels to train a 3-dimensional (3D) neural network using the entire 3D image. Deep supervision and a Dice-weighted multiclass loss function were applied. Results were assessed pre/post augmentation and post-processing (3D conditional random field (CRF)). Results for 11 test CTs (7 unique patients) were compared to ground-truth and a multi-atlas method (MA) via Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), mean distance to agreement (MDA), and Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests. Three physicians evaluated clinical acceptance via consensus scoring (5-point scale). RESULTS The model stabilized in ~19 hours (200 epochs, training error <0.001). Augmentation and CRF increased DSC 5.0±7.9% and 1.2±2.5%, across substructures, respectively. DL provided accurate segmentations for chambers (DSC=0.88±0.03), GVs (DSC=0.85±0.03), and pulmonary veins (DSC=0.77±0.04). Combined DSC for CAs was 0.50±0.14. MDA across substructures was <2.0mm (GV MDA=1.24±0.31mm). No substructures had statistical volume differences (P<0.05) to ground-truth. In four cases, DL yielded left main CA contours, whereas MA segmentation failed, and provided improved consensus scores in 44/60 comparisons to MA. DL provided clinically acceptable segmentations for all graded patients for 3/4 chambers. DL contour generation took ~14s per patient. CONCLUSIONS These promising results suggest DL poses major efficiency and accuracy gains for cardiac substructure segmentation offering high potential for rapid implementation into RTP for improved cardiac sparing."
2017,Deep learning-based assessment of tumor-associated stroma for diagnosing breast cancer in histopathology images,"Diagnosis of breast carcinomas has so far been limited to the morphological interpretation of epithelial cells and the assessment of epithelial tissue architecture. Consequently, most of the automated systems have focused on characterizing the epithelial regions of the breast to detect cancer. In this paper, we propose a system for classification of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stained breast specimens based on convolutional neural networks that primarily targets the assessment of tumor-associated stroma to diagnose breast cancer patients. We evaluate the performance of our proposed system using a large cohort containing 646 breast tissue biopsies. Our evaluations show that the proposed system achieves an area under ROC of 0.92, demonstrating the discriminative power of previously neglected tumor associated stroma as a diagnostic biomarker."
2014,Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Artificial Neural Networks with Extreme Learning Techniques,"Breast cancer is the second cause of dead among women. Early detection followed by appropriate cancer treatment can reduce the deadly risk. Medical professionals can make mistakes while identifying a disease. The help of technology such as data mining and machine learning can substantially improve the diagnosis accuracy. Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) has been widely used in intelligent breast cancer diagnosis. However, the standard Gradient-Based Back Propagation Artificial Neural Networks (BP ANN) has some limitations. There are parameters to be set in the beginning, long time for training process, and possibility to be trapped in local minima. In this research, we implemented ANN with extreme learning techniques for diagnosing breast cancer based on Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset. Results showed that Extreme Learning Machine Neural Networks (ELM ANN) has better generalization classifier model than BP ANN. The development of this technique is promising as intelligent component in medical decision support systems."
2015,Dendrosomal curcumin suppresses metastatic breast cancer in mice by changing m1/m2 macrophage balance in the tumor microenvironment.,"Curcumin, a lipid-soluble compound extracted from the plant Curcuma Longa, has been found to exert immunomodulatory effects via macrophages. However, most studies focus on the low bioavailability issue of curcumin by nano and microparticles, and thus the role of macrophages in the anticancer mechanism of curcumin has received little attention so far. We have previously shown the potential biocompatibility, biodegradability and anti-cancer effects of dendrosomal curcumin (DNC). In this study, twenty-seven BALB/c mice were equally divided into control as well as 40 and 80 mg/kg groups of DNC to investigate the involvement of macrophages in the antitumor effects of curcumin in a typical animal model of metastatic breast cancer. At the end of intervention, the tumor volume and weight were significantly reduced in DNC groups compared to control (P<0.05). Histopathological data showed the presence of macrophages in tumor and spleen tissues. Real-time PCR results showed that DNC increased the expression of STAT4 and IL-12 genes in tumor and spleen tissues in comparison with control (P<0.05), referring to the high levels of M1 macrophages. Furthermore treatment with DNC decreased STAT3, IL-10 and arginase I gene expression (P<0.05), indicating low levels of M2 macrophage. The results confirm the role of macrophages in the protective effects of dendrosomal curcumin against metastatic breast cancer in mice."
2018,Predicting Potential Drugs for Breast Cancer based on miRNA and Tissue Specificity,"Network-based computational method, with the emphasis on biomolecular interactions and biological data integration, has succeeded in drug development and created new directions, such as drug repositioning and drug combination. Drug repositioning, that is finding new uses for existing drugs to treat more patients, offers time, cost and efficiency benefits in drug development, especially when in silico techniques are used. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in multiple biological processes and have attracted much scientific attention recently. Moreover, cumulative studies demonstrate that the mature miRNAs as well as their precursors can be targeted by small molecular drugs. At the same time, human diseases result from the disordered interplay of tissue- and cell lineage-specific processes. However, few computational researches predict drug-disease potential relationships based on miRNA data and tissue specificity. Therefore, based on miRNA data and the tissue specificity of diseases, we propose a new method named as miTS to predict the potential treatments for diseases. Firstly, based on miRNAs data, target genes and information of FDA (Food and Drug Administration) approved drugs, we evaluate the relationships between miRNAs and drugs in the tissue-specific PPI (protein-protein) network. Then, we construct a tripartite network: drug-miRNA-disease Finally, we obtain the potential drug-disease associations based on the tripartite network. In this paper, we take breast cancer as case study and focus on the top-30 predicted drugs. 25 of them (83.3%) are found having known connections with breast cancer in CTD (Comparative Toxicogenomics Database) benchmark and the other 5 drugs are potential drugs for breast cancer. We further evaluate the 5 newly predicted drugs from clinical records, literature mining, KEGG pathways enrichment analysis and overlapping genes between enriched pathways. For each of the 5 new drugs, strongly supported evidences can be found in three or more aspects. In particular, Regorafenib (DB08896) has 15 overlapping KEGG pathways with breast cancer and their p-values are all very small. In addition, whether in the literature curation or clinical validation, Regorafenib has a strong correlation with breast cancer. All the facts show that Regorafenib is likely to be a truly effective drug, worthy of our further study. It further follows that our method miTS is effective and practical for predicting new drug indications, which will provide potential values for treatments of complex diseases."
2016,Impact of Adjuvant Endocrine Therapy on Quality of Life and Symptoms: Observational Data Over 12 Months From the Mind-Body Study.,"PURPOSE To examine patterns of health and symptoms associated with the initiation of adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) for primary breast cancer treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS The mind-body study (MBS) observational cohort participants provided self-reported data on physical and mental health, ET-related symptoms, as well as depression, fatigue, and sleep obtained at enrollment (after primary treatment, prior to initiation of ET) and 6 and 12 months later. Longitudinal trajectories of outcome variables among three patient groups (no ET, aromatase inhibitor [AI], or tamoxifen) were compared by using linear mixed models. RESULTS Two-thirds of the 186 women initiated ET, which was evenly split between AI and tamoxifen, and no significant differences were observed in self-reported measures among the groups at baseline or in covariate-adjusted analyses. Physical health scores were below normative levels initially and improved over time, but the AI group had a significantly lower score at 12 months (P = .05); mental health scores were within the normal range, were similar in each group, and did not change over time. The no-ET group showed either stable or declining symptom severity, whereas the ET groups often showed increased severity over time, and the AI group reported more severe musculoskeletal (P = .02), hot flash (P = .02), and cognitive problems (P = .006) at one or both of the follow-up time points compared with the no-ET group. The tamoxifen group had higher levels of hot flashes (P = .002), cognitive problems (P = .016), and bladder problems (P = .02) than the no-ET group. CONCLUSION Attention should be given to the increased symptom burden associated with ET, and better efforts should be made to address patient-reported outcomes."
2021,GPDBN: deep bilinear network integrating both genomic data and pathological images for breast cancer prognosis prediction,"Abstract Motivation Breast cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and there is an urgent need to design computational methods that can accurately predict the prognosis of breast cancer for appropriate therapeutic regime. Recently, deep learning-based methods have achieved great success in prognosis prediction, but many of them directly combine features from different modalities that may ignore the complex inter-modality relations. In addition, existing deep learning-based methods do not take intra-modality relations into consideration that are also beneficial to prognosis prediction. Therefore, it is of great importance to develop a deep learning-based method that can take advantage of the complementary information between intra-modality and inter-modality by integrating data from different modalities for more accurate prognosis prediction of breast cancer. Results We present a novel unified framework named genomic and pathological deep bilinear network (GPDBN) for prognosis prediction of breast cancer by effectively integrating both genomic data and pathological images. In GPDBN, an inter-modality bilinear feature encoding module is proposed to model complex inter-modality relations for fully exploiting intrinsic relationship of the features across different modalities. Meanwhile, intra-modality relations that are also beneficial to prognosis prediction, are captured by two intra-modality bilinear feature encoding modules. Moreover, to take advantage of the complementary information between inter-modality and intra-modality relations, GPDBN further combines the inter- and intra-modality bilinear features by using a multi-layer deep neural network for final prognosis prediction. Comprehensive experiment results demonstrate that the proposed GPDBN significantly improves the performance of breast cancer prognosis prediction and compares favorably with existing methods. Availabilityand implementation GPDBN is freely available at https://github.com/isfj/GPDBN. Supplementary information Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."
2020,A Brief Survey on Breast Cancer Diagnostic With Deep Learning Schemes Using Multi-Image Modalities,"Patients with breast cancer are prone to serious health-related complications with higher mortality. The primary reason might be a misinterpretation of radiologists in recognizing suspicious lesions due to technical issues in imaging qualities and heterogeneous breast densities which increases the false-(positive and negative) ratio. Early intervention is significant in establishing an up-to-date prognosis process which can successfully mitigate complications of disease with higher recovery. The manual screening of breast abnormalities through traditional machine learning schemes misinterpret the inconsistent feature-extraction process which poses a problem, i.e., patients being called-back for biopsies to eliminates the suspicions. However, several deep learning-based methods have been developed for reliable breast cancer prognosis and classification but very few of them provided a comprehensive overview of lesions segmentation. This research focusses on providing benefits and risks of breast multi-imaging modalities, segmentation schemes, feature extraction, classification of breast abnormalities through state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. This research also explores various well-known databases using ”Breast Cancer” keyword to present a comprehensive survey on existing diagnostic schemes to open-up new research challenges for radiologists and researchers to intervene as early as possible to develop an efficient and reliable breast cancer prognosis system using prominent deep learning schemes."
2018,Breast cancer diagnosis using adaptive voting ensemble machine learning algorithm,"According to Breast Cancer Institute (BCI), Breast Cancer is one of the most dangerous type of diseases that is very effective for women in the world. As per clinical expert detecting this cancer in its first stage helps in saving lives. As per cancer.net offers individualized guides for more than 120 types of cancer and related hereditary syndromes. For detecting breast cancer mostly machine learning techniques are used. In this paper we proposed adaptive ensemble voting method for diagnosed breast cancer using Wisconsin Breast Cancer database. The aim of this work is to compare and explain how ANN and logistic algorithm provide better solution when its work with ensemble machine learning algorithms for diagnosing breast cancer even the variables are reduced. In this paper we used the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer dataset. When compared to related work from the literature. It is shown that the ANN approach with logistic algorithm is achieved 98.50% accuracy from another machine learning algorithm."
2021,3D-Printed Microfluidics and Potential Biomedical Applications,"3D printing is a smart additive manufacturing technique that allows the engineering of biomedical devices that are usually difficult to design using conventional methodologies such as machining or molding. Nowadays, 3D-printed microfluidics has gained enormous attention due to their various advantages including fast production, cost-effectiveness, and accurate designing of a range of products even geometrically complex devices. In this review, we focused on the recent significant findings in the field of 3D-printed microfluidic devices for biomedical applications. 3D printers are used as fabrication tools for a broad variety of systems for a range of applications like diagnostic microfluidic chips to detect different analytes, for example, glucose, lactate, and glutamate and the biomarkers related to different clinically relevant diseases, for example, malaria, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. 3D printers can print various materials (inorganic and polymers) with varying density, strength, and chemical properties that provide users with a broad variety of strategic options. In this article, we have discussed potential 3D printing techniques for the fabrication of microfluidic devices that are suitable for biomedical applications. Emerging diagnostic technologies using 3D printing as a method for integrating living cells or biomaterials into 3D printing are also reviewed."
2016,Trends of Breast Cancer in Ethiopia,"Purpose: The essence of this study is to illustrate the trends of breast cancer among women living in different regions of Ethiopia and to offer suggestions about some measures to put in place to control the disease and reduce its morbidity and mortality. Methods: Data were collected from October 2014 to April 2015. Data on new cases of breast cancer registered annually at the cancer registry of the Tikur Anbessa Specialize Hospital (TASH) over a period of sixteen years were obtained retrospectively and analysed using MS office and SPSS Version 20. Results: There were 3460 new cases of breast cancer registered at the cancer registry during the16-year period. The peak age of incidence was the 4th and 5th decade. Most of the cases were found in Addis Ababa, where the hospital is situated. An increase in trend of breast cancer case was observed in the hospital. Conclusion: Non-declining incidence of breast cancer in this study indicates; the awareness of people to be diagnosed is improved and more cancerous patients are there in the country, and inadequate or ineffective control measure to stem its morbidity due to diversion of the health care system’s attention to HIV/AIDS and malaria. Therefore, there is the need to step up activities through NGOs, screening programs and trainings such as mammography, clinical and selfexamination, to control the upward trends of breast cancer in the country. In addition, it will be important to open breast cancer diagnosing centre in each region of the country in order to know the number of cases, which will be affected by being undiagnosed due to farness to the diagnosing centre. Additional researches on breast cancer post treatment survival rate, on risk factors assessment, patient quality of life and others are recommended in future."
2022,"Microwave Imaging for Early Breast Cancer Detection: Current State, Challenges, and Future Directions","Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer type and is the leading cause of cancer-related death among females worldwide. Breast screening and early detection are currently the most successful approaches for the management and treatment of this disease. Several imaging modalities are currently utilized for detecting breast cancer, of which microwave imaging (MWI) is gaining quite a lot of attention as a promising diagnostic tool for early breast cancer detection. MWI is a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive, fast, convenient, and safe screening tool. The purpose of this paper is to provide an up-to-date survey of the principles, developments, and current research status of MWI for breast cancer detection. This paper is structured into two sections; the first is an overview of current MWI techniques used for detecting breast cancer, followed by an explanation of the working principle behind MWI and its various types, namely, microwave tomography and radar-based imaging. In the second section, a review of the initial experiments along with more recent studies on the use of MWI for breast cancer detection is presented. Furthermore, the paper summarizes the challenges facing MWI as a breast cancer detection tool and provides future research directions. On the whole, MWI has proven its potential as a screening tool for breast cancer detection, both as a standalone or complementary technique. However, there are a few challenges that need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of this imaging modality and translate it to clinical settings."
2018,"High Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase Is Correlated With Microvessel Density and Worse Prognosis in Breast Cancer","Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), which catalyzes the breakdown of the essential amino acid tryptophan into kynurenine, is understood to have a key role in cancer immunotherapy. IDO has also received more attention because of its non-immune functions including regulating angiogenesis. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of IDO on microvessel density (MVD), and to explore its prognostic role in breast cancer. We showed IDO expression was positively correlated with MVD labeled by CD105 (MVD-CD105) rather than MVD labeled by CD31 (MVD-CD31) in breast cancer specimens. Both IDO expression and MVD-CD105 level were associated with initial TNM stage, histological grade, and tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) metastasis in breast cancer. In the prognostic analysis, TDLNs metastasis, an advanced TNM stage (III) and high histological grade (III) significantly predicted shorter survival in univariate analysis. Concentrating on IDO and MVD, the patients with IDO expression or high MVD level had poorer prognosis compared with no IDO expression [P = 0.047 for progress-free survival (PFS)] and low MVD level (P = 0.019 for OS); the patients with IDO expression and high MVD level had a tendency with shorter overall survival when compared with non IDO expression, low MVD level, or both (P = 0.062 for OS). In multivariate analysis, an advanced TNM stage (III) was significantly associated with shorter 5-year survival rate of PFS (HR: 0.126, 95% CI: 0.024–0.669, P = 0.015). In order to verify the phenomenon of IDO promoting angiogenesis, we contained the study in vitro. We detected the expression of IDO mRNA in breast cancer cell lines and measured the concentration of tryptophan and kynurenine in the supernatants of MCF-7 by high performance liquid chromatography. The ratio of Kyn and trp (kyn/trp) was calculated to estimate IDO-enzyme activity. MCF-7 cells, which produce high level of IDO and metabolize tryptophan, promoted human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation significantly in co-culture system. Meanwhile IDO could upregulate the expression of CD105 in HUVEC, which was downregulated after adding IDO inhibitor, 1-methyl-d-trytophan. These results suggest that IDO could promote angiogenesis in breast cancer, providing a novel, potentially effective molecular or gene therapy target for angiogenesis inhibition in the future."
2017,Predicting Long-Term Cognitive Outcome Following Breast Cancer with Pre-Treatment Resting State fMRI and Random Forest Machine Learning,"We aimed to determine if resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) acquired at pre-treatment baseline could accurately predict breast cancer-related cognitive impairment at long-term follow-up. We evaluated 31 patients with breast cancer (age 34–65) prior to any treatment, post-chemotherapy and 1 year later. Cognitive testing scores were normalized based on data obtained from 43 healthy female controls and then used to categorize patients as impaired or not based on longitudinal changes. We measured clustering coefficient, a measure of local connectivity, by applying graph theory to baseline resting state fMRI and entered these metrics along with relevant patient-related and medical variables into random forest classification. Incidence of cognitive impairment at 1 year follow-up was 55% and was predicted by classification algorithms with up to 100% accuracy (p < 0.0001). The neuroimaging-based model was significantly more accurate than a model involving patient-related and medical variables (p = 0.005). Hub regions belonging to several distinct functional networks were the most important predictors of cognitive outcome. Characteristics of these hubs indicated potential spread of brain injury from default mode to other networks over time. These findings suggest that resting state fMRI is a promising tool for predicting future cognitive impairment associated with breast cancer. This information could inform treatment decision making by identifying patients at highest risk for long-term cognitive impairment."
2016,Weighted Naive Bayes Classifier: A Predictive Model for Breast Cancer Detection,"this paper investigation of the performance criterion of a machine learning tool, Naive Bayes Classifier with a new weighted approach in classifying breast cancer is done . Naive Bayes is one of the most effective classification algorithms. In many decision making system, ranking performance is an interesting and desirable concept than just classification. So to extend traditional Naive Bayes, and to improve its performance, weighted concept is incorporated. Exploration of Domain knowledge based weight assignment on UCI machine learning repository dataset of breast cancer is performed. As Breast cancer is considered to be second leading cause of death in women today. The experiments show that a weighted naive bayes approach outperforms naive bayes.

2021,Breast ultrasound tumour classification: A Machine Learning—Radiomics based approach,"Prediction of breast tumour malignancy using ultrasound imaging, is an important step for early detection of breast cancer. An efficient prediction system can be a great help to improve the survival chances of the involved patients. In this work, a machine learning (ML)—radiomics based classification pipeline is proposed, to perform this predictive modelling task, in a much more efficient manner. Multiple different types of image features of the region of interests are considered in this work, followed by a recursive feature elimination based feature selection step. Furthermore, a synthetic minority oversampling technique based step is also included in the pipeline, to deal with the class imbalance problem, that is often present in medical imaging datasets. Various ML models are considered in the subsequent model training phase, on a publicly available breast ultrasound image dataset (BUSI). From experimental analysis it has been observed that, shape, texture and histogram oriented gradients related features are the most informative, with respect to the predictive modelling task. Furthermore, it was observed that ensemble learners such as random forest, gradient boosting and AdaBoost classifiers are able to achieve significant results with respect to multiple evaluation metrics. The proposed approach achieved the state‐of‐the‐art accuracy, area under the curve, F1‐score and Mathews correlation coefficient values of 0.974, 0.97, 0.94 and 0.959, respectively, on the BUSI dataset. Such kind of impressive results suggest that the proposed approach can have a very high practical utility, in real medical diagnostic settings."
2019,Prediction of Breast Cancer Using Supervised Machine Learning Techniques,": Breast Cancer is the most often identified cancer among women and major reason for increasing mortality rate among women. As the diagnosis of this disease manually takes long hours and the lesser availability of systems, there is a need to develop the automatic diagnosis system for early detection of cancer. Data mining techniques contribute a lot in the development of such system. For the classification of benign and malignant tumor we have used classification techniques of machine learning in which the machine is learned from the past data and can predict the category of new input. This paper is a relative study on the implementation of models using Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) is done on the dataset taken from the UCI repository. With respect to the results of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity and False Positive Rate the efficiency of each algorithm is measured and compared. These techniques are coded in python and executed in Spyder, the Scientific Python Development Environment. Our experiments have shown that SVM is the best for predictive analysis with an accuracy of 92.7%.We infer from our study that SVM is the well suited algorithm for prediction and on the whole KNN presented well next to SVM."
2021,The Role of Gut Microbial β-Glucuronidase in Estrogen Reactivation and Breast Cancer,"Over the past decade, the gut microbiota has received considerable attention for its interactions with the host. Microbial β-glucuronidase generated by this community has hence aroused concern for its biotransformation activity to a wide range of exogenous (foreign) and endogenous compounds. Lately, the role of gut microbial β-glucuronidase in the pathogenesis of breast cancer has been proposed for its estrogen reactivation activity. This is plausible considering that estrogen glucuronides are the primary products of estrogens’ hepatic phase II metabolism and are subject to β-glucuronidase-catalyzed hydrolysis in the gut via bile excretion. However, research in this field is still at its very preliminary stage. This review outlines the biology of microbial β-glucuronidase in the gastrointestinal tract and elaborates on the clues to the existence of microbial β-glucuronidase–estrogen metabolism–breast cancer axis. The research gaps in this field will be discussed and possible strategies to address these challenges are suggested."
2020,Prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer using a deep learning (DL) method,The aim of the study was to develop a deep learning (DL) algorithm to evaluate the pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in breast cancer.
2022,Triple-negative breast cancer: current treatment strategies and factors of negative prognosis,"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the most common cause of death in working-age women. According to the results of immunohistochemical studies, 10–20% of cases revealed a triple-negative type of breast cancer. This subtype is characterized by significant proliferative activity and growth rate, aggressive clinical course, and early metastasis. This leads to a suspicious prognosis and, accordingly, encourages an increase of surgical treatment radicalism and aggressive systemic treatment. This review briefly analyzes existing treatment strategies for triple-negative breast cancer with a focus on surgical treatment. Surgical treatment is an integral part of complex therapy. Currently, the attention of researchers is focused not only on the radicalism of the operation, ensuring long-term survival, but also on achieving a good cosmetic result that determines the quality of life of patients. In this aspect, organ-preserving and prosthetic methods of operations are promising, the feasibility and effectiveness of which are being discussed. The relevance of choosing the optimal method of operation is evidenced by the lack of generally accepted approaches based on informative markers for the prognosis of the course of the disease. Therefore, the choice of the optimal method of surgical treatment taking into account the individual characteristics of the patient and the tumor, indications for chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remains an unresolved issue and requires further research."
2015,Raman spectroscopic analysis differentiates between breast cancer cell lines,"Breast cancer incident rates are increasing in women worldwide with the highest incidence rates reported in developing countries. Major breast cancer screening approaches like mammography, ultrasound, clinical breast examination (CBE) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are currently used but have their own limitations. Optical spectroscopy has attained great attention from biomedical researchers in recent years due to its non-invasive and non-destructive detection approach. Chemometrics is one of the powerful tools used in spectroscopic research to enhance its sensitivity. Raman spectroscopy, a vibrational spectroscopic approach, has been used to explore the chemical fingerprints of different biological tissues including normal and malignant types. This approach was used to characterize and differentiate two breast cancer and one normal breast cell lines (MDA-MB-436, MCF-7 and MCF-10A) using dispersive Raman spectroscopy. Raman spectra of the cell lines have revealed that basic differences in the concentration of biochemical compounds such as lipids, nucleic acids and protein Raman peaks were found to differ in intensity, and principal component analysis (PCA) was able to identify variations that lead to accurate and reliable separation of the three cell lines. Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) model of three cell lines was predicted with 100% sensitivity and 91% specificity. We have shown that a combination of Raman spectroscopy and chemometrics are capable of differentiation between breast cancer cell lines. These variations may be useful in identifying new spectral markers to differentiate different subtypes of breast cancer although this needs confirmation in a larger panel of cell lines as well as clinical material.

2015,Triple negative breast cancer: a multi-omics network discovery strategy for candidate targets and driving pathways.,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) represents approximately 15% of breast cancers and is characterized by lack of expression of both estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR), together with absence of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2). TNBC has attracted considerable attention due to its aggressiveness such as large tumor size, high proliferation rate, and metastasis. The absence of clinically efficient molecular targets is of great concern in treatment of patients with TNBC. In light of the complexity of TNBC, we applied a systematic and integrative transcriptomics and interactomics approach utilizing transcriptional regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks to discover putative transcriptional control mechanisms of TNBC. To this end, we identified TNBC-driven molecular pathways such as the Janus kinase-signal transducers, and activators of transcription (JAK-STAT) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) signaling pathways. The multi-omics molecular target and biomarker discovery approach presented here can offer ways forward on novel diagnostics and potentially help to design personalized therapeutics for TNBC in the future."
2021,Domain Knowledge Powered Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Based on Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound Videos,"In recent years, deep learning has been widely used in breast cancer diagnosis, and many high-performance models have emerged. However, most of the existing deep learning models are mainly based on static breast ultrasound (US) images. In actual diagnostic process, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) is a commonly used technique by radiologists. Compared with static breast US images, CEUS videos can provide more detailed blood supply information of tumors, and therefore can help radiologists make a more accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel diagnosis model based on CEUS videos. The backbone of the model is a 3D convolutional neural network. More specifically, we notice that radiologists generally follow two specific patterns when browsing CEUS videos. One pattern is that they focus on specific time slots, and the other is that they pay attention to the differences between the CEUS frames and the corresponding US images. To incorporate these two patterns into our deep learning model, we design a domain-knowledge-guided temporal attention module and a channel attention module. We validate our model on our Breast-CEUS dataset composed of 221 cases. The result shows that our model can achieve a sensitivity of 97.2% and an accuracy of 86.3%. In particular, the incorporation of domain knowledge leads to a 3.5% improvement in sensitivity and a 6.0% improvement in specificity. Finally, we also prove the validity of two domain knowledge modules in the 3D convolutional neural network (C3D) and the 3D ResNet (R3D)."
2014,An in vitro evaluation of graphene oxide reduced by Ganoderma spp. in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231),"Background Recently, graphene and graphene-related materials have attracted much attention due their unique properties, such as their physical, chemical, and biocompatibility properties. This study aimed to determine the cytotoxic effects of graphene oxide (GO) that is reduced biologically using Ganoderma spp. mushroom extracts in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. Methods Herein, we describe a facile and green method for the reduction of GO using extracts of Ganoderma spp. as a reducing agent. GO was reduced without any hazardous chemicals in an aqueous solution, and the reduced GO was characterized using a range of analytical procedures. The Ganoderma extract (GE)-reduced GO (GE-rGO) was characterized by ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Furthermore, the toxicity of GE-rGO was evaluated using a sequence of assays such as cell viability, lactate dehydrogenase leakage, and reactive oxygen species generation in human breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). Results The preliminary characterization of reduction of GO was confirmed by the red-shifting of the absorption peak for GE-rGO to 265 nm from 230 nm. The size of GO and GE-rGO was found to be 1,880 and 3,200 nm, respectively. X-ray diffraction results confirmed that reduction processes of GO and the processes of removing intercalated water molecules and the oxide groups. The surface functionalities and chemical natures of GO and GE-rGO were confirmed using Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The surface morphologies of the synthesized graphene were analyzed using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy. Raman spectroscopy revealed single- and multilayer properties of GE-rGO. Atomic force microscopy images provided evidence for the formation of graphene. Furthermore, the effect of GO and GE-rGO was examined using a series of assays, such as cell viability, membrane integrity, and reactive oxygen species generation, which are key molecules involved in apoptosis. The results obtained from cell viability and lactate dehydrogenase assay suggest that GO and GE-rGO cause dose-dependent toxicity in the cells. Interestingly, it was found that biologically derived GE-rGO is more toxic to cancer cells than GO. Conclusion We describe a simple, green, nontoxic, and cost-effective approach to producing graphene using mushroom extract as a reducing and stabilizing agent. The proposed method could enable synthesis of graphene with potential biological and biomedical applications such as in cancer and angiogenic disorders. To our knowledge, this is the first report using mushroom extract as a reducing agent for the synthesis of graphene. Mushroom extract can be used as a biocatalyst for the production of graphene."
2021,Multi-Institutional Validation of a Mammography-Based Breast Cancer Risk Model,"PURPOSE Accurate risk assessment is essential for the success of population screening programs in breast cancer. Models with high sensitivity and specificity would enable programs to target more elaborate screening efforts to high-risk populations, while minimizing overtreatment for the rest. Artificial intelligence (AI)-based risk models have demonstrated a significant advance over risk models used today in clinical practice. However, the responsible deployment of novel AI requires careful validation across diverse populations. To this end, we validate our AI-based model, Mirai, across globally diverse screening populations. METHODS We collected screening mammograms and pathology-confirmed breast cancer outcomes from Massachusetts General Hospital, USA; Novant, USA; Emory, USA; Maccabi-Assuta, Israel; Karolinska, Sweden; Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taiwan; and Barretos, Brazil. We evaluated Uno's concordance index for Mirai in predicting risk of breast cancer at one to five years from the mammogram. RESULTS A total of 128,793 mammograms from 62,185 patients were collected across the seven sites, of which 3,815 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Mirai obtained concordance indices of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72 to 0.78), 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70 to 0.80), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75 to 0.79), 0.77 (95% CI, 0.73 to 0.81), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79 to 0.82), 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.83), and 0.84 (95% CI, 0.81 to 0.88) at Massachusetts General Hospital, Novant, Emory, Maccabi-Assuta, Karolinska, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, and Barretos, respectively. CONCLUSION Mirai, a mammography-based risk model, maintained its accuracy across globally diverse test sets from seven hospitals across five countries. This is the broadest validation to date of an AI-based breast cancer model and suggests that the technology can offer broad and equitable improvements in care. Mirai, an AI-based breast cancer risk model, maintained its accuracy across seven hospitals from five countries"
2016,MO-DE-207B-06: Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Breast Ultrasound Images Using Transfer Learning From Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.,"PURPOSE To assess the performance of using transferred features from pre-trained deep convolutional networks (CNNs) in the task of classifying cancer in breast ultrasound images, and to compare this method of transfer learning with previous methods involving human-designed features. METHODS A breast ultrasound dataset consisting of 1125 cases and 2393 regions of interest (ROIs) was used. Each ROI was labeled as cystic, benign, or malignant. Features were extracted from each ROI using pre-trained CNNs and used to train support vector machine (SVM) classifiers in the tasks of distinguishing non-malignant (benign+cystic) vs malignant lesions and benign vs malignant lesions. For a baseline comparison, classifiers were also trained on prior analytically-extracted tumor features. Five-fold cross-validation (by case) was conducted with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the performance metric. RESULTS Classifiers trained on CNN-extracted features were comparable to classifiers trained on human-designed features. In the non-malignant vs malignant task, both the SVM trained on CNN-extracted features and the SVM trained on human-designed features obtained an AUC of 0.90. In the task of determining benign vs malignant, the SVM trained on CNN-extracted features obtained an AUC of 0.88, compared to the AUC of 0.85 obtained by the SVM trained on human-designed features. CONCLUSION We obtained strong results using transfer learning to characterize ultrasound breast cancer images. This method allows us to directly classify a small dataset of lesions in a computationally inexpensive fashion without any manual input. Modern deep learning methods in computer vision are contingent on large datasets and vast computational resources, which are often inaccessible for clinical applications. Consequently, we believe transfer learning methods will be important for computer-aided diagnosis schemes in order to utilize advancements in deep learning and computer vision without the associated costs.

2020,Breast Cancer Risk Prediction using XGBoost and Random Forest Algorithm,"Breast cancer is as one of the common and serious cause of death among women globally. This is a disease where the cells grow out of control inside the breast. Family History of cancer disease, physical inactivity, psychological stress, increase in breast size are the risk factors of breast cancer. In this research paper, breast cancer dataset was analyzed to predict breast cancer using popular two ensemble machine learning algorithms. Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were used to predict breast cancer. A total of 275 instances with 12 features were used for this analysis. With Random forest algorithm 74.73% accuracy and 73.63% using XGBoost had obtained in this analysis."
2015,Factors perceived to influence exercise adherence in women with breast cancer participating in an exercise programme during adjuvant chemotherapy: a focus group study.,"AIMS AND OBJECTIVES To explore factors influencing exercise adherence among women with breast cancer while following an exercise programme. BACKGROUND Earlier research shows that women with breast cancer decrease physical activity following the cancer diagnosis and that adhering to exercise interventions can be a challenge. Research is needed to identify motivational factors and barriers for exercise adherence among women during treatment for breast cancer. DESIGN This was a qualitative study to explore patient's perceptions of the challenges to exercise adherence during a randomised, controlled trial. METHODS Twenty-seven women with early-stage breast cancer were purposively sampled for focus group interviews during 2011-2012 from their participation in the exercise intervention group during 2010-2012. Five focus groups were performed, and data analysis was completed using the systematic text condensation method. RESULTS During the focus group study, five main themes were identified, which described factors participants perceived to influence their adherence to exercise during chemotherapy: 'side effects of breast cancer treatment as a barrier to exercise', 'restoring and maintaining normality in daily life motivates exercise', 'other valued activities compete with exercise', 'constructive support enhances exercise' and 'positive beliefs about efficacy and outcomes motivate exercise'. CONCLUSION Adherence to exercise in women with breast cancer is challenged by internal and external conditions and may be improved by attention to the impact of treatment side effects and by supporting patient self-efficacy towards changing health behaviour. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE Nurses should be aware that exercise adherence could be a challenge among women with breast cancer.

It also summarizes recent advances in computer-aided diagnosis/detection (CAD) systems, which make use of new deep learning methods to automatically recognize breast images and improve the accuracy of diagnoses made by radiologists. This review is based upon published literature in the past decade (January 2010–January 2020), where we obtained around 250 research articles, and after an eligibility process, 59 articles were presented in more detail. The main findings in the classification process revealed that new DL-CAD methods are useful and effective screening tools for breast cancer, thus reducing the need for manual feature extraction. The breast tumor research community can utilize this survey as a basis for their current and future studies."
2017,Machine learning for improved diagnosis and prognosis in healthcare,"Machine learning has gained tremendous interest in the last decade fueled by cheaper computing power and inexpensive memory — making it efficient to store, process and analyze growing volumes of data. Enhanced algorithms are being designed and applied on large datasets to help discover hidden insights and correlations amongst data elements not obvious to human. These insights help businesses take better decisions and optimize key indicators of interest. The growing popularity of machine learning also stems from the fact that learning algorithms are agnostic to the domain of application. Classification algorithms, for example, that could be applied to categorize faults in windmill blades can also be used for categorizing TV viewers in a survey. The actual value of machine learning however depends on the ability to adapt and apply these algorithms to solve specific real world problems. In this paper we discuss two such applications for interpreting medical data for automated analysis. Our first case study demonstrates the use of Bayesian Inference, a paradigm of machine learning, for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease based on cognitive test results and demographic data. In the second case study we focus on automated classification of cell images to determine the advancement and severity of breast cancer using artificial neural networks. Although these research are still preliminary, they demonstrate the value of machine learning techniques in providing quick, efficient and automated data analysis. Machine learning offers hope with early diagnosis of diseases, help patients in making informed decisions on treatment options and can help in improving overall quality of their lives."
2019,Risk factors for distant metastasis of patients with primary triple-negative breast cancer,"Objective: Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) involves higher rates of recurrence and distant metastasis. The present study sought to characterize the risk factors for distant metastasis of TNBC. Methods: The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was exploited to enroll patients diagnosed with TNBC from 2010 to 2015. The eligible patients were dichotomized into locoregional and distant metastasis at the time of diagnosis. Patients’ demographics and tumor features, and treatment were evaluated to identify the risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. The categorical variables were examined by chi-square tests. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the risk factors for distant metastasis. Breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by Kaplan–Meier plots with log-rank tests. Results: We collected 26863 patients with primary TNBC, 1330 (5.0%) of them presented with distant metastasis. In the univariate analysis, all the variables indicated statistical significance. The significant variables were subsequently enlisted into the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Age > 50, higher clinical stage T and N, and tumor size > 5 cm were independent risk factors for distant metastasis of primary TNBC. Moreover, higher clinical stage T and stage N were independent risk factors for bone metastasis of the patients. TNBC patients with either bone or visceral metastasis have poor survival, with brain metastasis worst of all, though the OS difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: TNBC patients with larger age, higher clinical stage, larger tumor size were more predisposed to have distant metastasis. Great attention should be paid to the prognosis of these patients with distant metastasis."
2018,Identification of Estrogen Receptor α Antagonists from Natural Products via In Vitro and In Silico Approaches,"Estrogen receptor α (ERα) is a successful target for ER-positive breast cancer and also reported to be relevant in many other diseases. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) make a good therapeutic effect in clinic. Because of the drug resistance and side effects of current SERMs, the discovery of new SERMs is given more and more attention. Virtual screening is a validated method to high effectively to identify novel bioactive small molecules. Ligand-based machine learning methods and structure-based molecular docking were first performed for identification of ERα antagonist from in-house natural product library. Naive Bayesian and recursive partitioning models with two kinds of descriptors were built and validated based on training set, test set, and external test set and then were utilized for distinction of active and inactive compounds. Totally, 162 compounds were predicted as ER antagonists and were further evaluated by molecular docking. According to docking score, we selected 8 representative compounds for both ERα competitor assay and luciferase reporter gene assay. Genistein, daidzein, phloretin, ellagic acid, ursolic acid, (−)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate, kaempferol, and naringenin exhibited different levels for antagonistic activity against ERα. These studies validated the feasibility of machine learning methods for predicting bioactivities of ligands and provided better insight into the natural products acting as estrogen receptor modulator, which are important lead compounds for future new drug design."
2019,Deep weakly-supervised learning methods for classification and localization in histology images: a survey,"Using state-of-the-art deep learning (DL) models to diagnose cancer from histology data presents several challenges related to the nature and availability of labeled histology images, including image size, stain variations, and label ambiguity. In addition, cancer grading and the localization of regions of interest (ROIs) in such images normally rely on both image- and pixel-level labels, with the latter requiring a costly annotation process. Deep weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) methods provide different strategies for low-cost training of DL models. Given only image-class annotations, these methods can be trained to simultaneously classify an image, and yield class activation maps (CAMs) for ROI localization. This paper provides a review of deep WSOL methods to identify and locate diseases in histology images, without the need for pixel-level annotations. We propose a taxonomy in which these methods are divided into bottom-up and top-down methods according to the information flow in models. Although the latter have seen only limited progress, recent bottom-up methods are currently driving a lot of progress with the use of deep WSOL methods. Early works focused on designing different spatial pooling functions. However, those methods quickly peaked in term of localization accuracy and revealed a major limitation, namely, – the under-activation of CAMs, which leads to high false negative localization. Subsequent works aimed to alleviate this shortcoming and recover the complete object from the background, using different techniques such as perturbation, self-attention, shallow features, pseudo-annotation, and task decoupling.In the present paper, representative deep WSOL methods from our taxonomy are also evaluated and compared in terms of classification and localization accuracy using two challenging public histology datasets – one for colon cancer (GlaS), and a second, for breast cancer (CAMELYON16). Overall, the results indicate poor localization performance, particularly for generic methods that were initially designed to process natural images. Methods designed to address the challenges posed by histology data often use priors such as ROI size, or additional pixel-wise supervision estimated from a pre-trained classifier, allowing them to achieve better results. However, all the methods suffer from high false positive/negative localization. Classification performance is mainly affected by the model selection process, which uses either the classification or the localization metric. Finally, four key challenges are identified in the application of deep WSOL methods in histology, namely, – under-/over-activation of CAMs, sensitivity to thresholding, and model selection – and research avenues are provided to mitigate them.

2014,Maternal Embryonic Leucine Zipper Kinase: Key Kinase for Stem Cell Phenotype in Glioma and Other Cancers,"Maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) is a member of the snf1/AMPK family of protein serine/threonine kinases that has recently gained significant attention in the stem cell and cancer biology field. Recent studies suggest that activation of this kinase is tightly associated with extended survival and accelerated proliferation of cancer stem cells (CSC) in various organs. Overexpression of MELK has been noted in various cancers, including colon, breast, ovaries, pancreas, prostate, and brain, making the inhibition of MELK an attractive therapeutic strategy for a variety of cancers. In the experimental cancer models, depletion of MELK by RNA interference or small molecule inhibitors induces apoptotic cell death of CSCs derived from glioblastoma multiforme and breast cancer, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanism of action of MELK includes, yet may not be restricted to, direct binding and activation of the oncogenic transcription factors c-JUN and FOXM1 in cancer cells but not in the normal counterparts. Following these preclinical studies, the phase I clinical trial for advanced cancers with OTSSP167 started in 2013, as the first-in-class MELK inhibitor. This review summarizes the current molecular understanding of MELK and the recent preclinical studies about MELK as a cancer therapeutic target. Mol Cancer Ther; 13(6); 1393–8. ©2014 AACR."
2022,Effective Class-Imbalance learning based on SMOTE and Convolutional Neural Networks,"Imbalanced Data (ID) is a problem that deters Machine Learning (ML) models from achieving satisfactory results. ID is the occurrence of a situation where the quantity of the samples belonging to one class outnumbers that of the other by a wide margin, making such models’ learning process biased towards the majority class. In recent years, to address this issue, several solutions have been put forward, which opt for either synthetically generating new data for the minority class or reducing the number of majority classes to balance the data. Hence, in this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of methods based on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) mixed with a variety of well-known imbalanced data solutions meaning oversampling and undersampling. Then, we propose a CNN-based model in combination with SMOTE to effectively handle imbalanced data. To evaluate our methods, we have used KEEL, breast cancer, and Z-Alizadeh Sani datasets. In order to achieve reliable results, we conducted our experiments 100 times with randomly shuffled data distributions. The classification results demonstrate that the mixed Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)-Normalization-CNN outperforms different methodologies achieving 99.08% accuracy on the 24 imbalanced datasets. Therefore, the proposed mixed model can be applied to imbalanced binary classification problems on other real datasets."
2020,A Deep-Learning Approach for Diagnosis of Metastatic Breast Cancer in Bones from Whole-Body Scans,"(1) Background: Bone metastasis is one of the most frequent diseases in breast, lung and prostate cancer; bone scintigraphy is the primary imaging method of screening that offers the highest sensitivity (95%) regarding metastases. To address the considerable problem of bone metastasis diagnosis, focused on breast cancer patients, artificial intelligence methods devoted to deep-learning algorithms for medical image analysis are investigated in this research work; (2) Methods: Deep learning is a powerful algorithm for automatic classification and diagnosis of medical images whereas its implementation is achieved by the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The purpose of this study is to build a robust CNN model that will be able to classify images of whole-body scans in patients suffering from breast cancer, depending on whether or not they are infected by metastasis of breast cancer; (3) Results: A robust CNN architecture is selected based on CNN exploration performance for bone metastasis diagnosis using whole-body scan images, achieving a high classification accuracy of 92.50%. The best-performing CNN method is compared with other popular and well-known CNN architectures for medical imaging like ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet, and DenseNet, reported in the literature, providing superior classification accuracy; and (4) Conclusions: Prediction results show the efficacy of the proposed deep learning approach in bone metastasis diagnosis for breast cancer patients in nuclear medicine."
2022,Artificial Intelligence Evaluation of 122 969 Mammography Examinations from a Population-based Screening Program.,"Background Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promising results for cancer detection with mammographic screening. However, evidence related to the use of AI in real screening settings remain sparse. Purpose To compare the performance of a commercially available AI system with routine, independent double reading with consensus as performed in a population-based screening program. Furthermore, the histopathologic characteristics of tumors with different AI scores were explored. Materials and Methods In this retrospective study, 122 969 screening examinations from 47 877 women performed at four screening units in BreastScreen Norway from October 2009 to December 2018 were included. The data set included 752 screen-detected cancers (6.1 per 1000 examinations) and 205 interval cancers (1.7 per 1000 examinations). Each examination had an AI score between 1 and 10, where 1 indicated low risk of breast cancer and 10 indicated high risk. Threshold 1, threshold 2, and threshold 3 were used to assess the performance of the AI system as a binary decision tool (selected vs not selected). Threshold 1 was set at an AI score of 10, threshold 2 was set to yield a selection rate similar to the consensus rate (8.8%), and threshold 3 was set to yield a selection rate similar to an average individual radiologist (5.8%). Descriptive statistics were used to summarize screening outcomes. Results A total of 653 of 752 screen-detected cancers (86.8%) and 92 of 205 interval cancers (44.9%) were given a score of 10 by the AI system (threshold 1). Using threshold 3, 80.1% of the screen-detected cancers (602 of 752) and 30.7% of the interval cancers (63 of 205) were selected. Screen-detected cancer with AI scores not selected using the thresholds had favorable histopathologic characteristics compared to those selected; opposite results were observed for interval cancer. Conclusion The proportion of screen-detected cancers not selected by the artificial intelligence (AI) system at the three evaluated thresholds was less than 20%. The overall performance of the AI system was promising according to cancer detection. © RSNA, 2022."
2020,RMAF: Relu-Memristor-Like Activation Function for Deep Learning,"Activation functions facilitate deep neural networks by introducing non-linearity to the learning process. The non-linearity feature gives the neural network the ability to learn complex patterns. Recently, the most widely used activation function is the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). Though, other various existing activation including hand-designed alternatives to ReLU have been proposed. However, none has succeeded in replacing ReLU due to their existing inconsistencies. In this work, activation function called ReLU-Memristor-like Activation Function (RMAF) is proposed to leverage benefits of negative values in neural networks. RMAF introduces a constant parameter ( $\alpha $ ) and a threshold parameter ( $p$ ) making the function smooth, non-monotonous, and introduces non-linearity in the network. Our experiments show that, the RMAF works better than ReLU and other activation functions on deeper models and across number of challenging datasets. Firstly, experiments are performed by training and classifying on multi-layer perceptron (MLP) over benchmark data such as the Wisconsin breast cancer, MNIST, Iris and Car evaluation. RMAF achieves high performance of 98.74%, 99.67%, 98.81% and 99.42% respectively, compared to Sigmoid, Tanh and ReLU. Secondly, experiments were performed on convolution neural network (ResNet) over MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 data and observed the proposed activation function achieves higher performance accuracy of 99.73%, 98.77% and 79.82% respectively than Tanh, ReLU and Swish. Additionally, we experimented our work on deep networks i.e. squeeze network (SqueezeNet), Dense connected neural network (DenseNet121) and ImageNet dataset, which RMAF produced the best performance. We note that, the RMAF converges faster than the other functions and can replace ReLU in any neural network due to the efficiency, scalability and its similarity to both ReLU and Swish."
2017,Role of Growth Hormone in Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers diagnosed in women. Approximately two-thirds of all breast cancers diagnosed are classified as hormone dependent, which indicates that hormones are the key factors that drive the growth of these breast cancers. Ovarian and pituitary hormones play a major role in the growth and development of normal mammary glands and breast cancer. In particular, the effect of the ovarian hormone estrogen has received much attention in regard to breast cancer. Pituitary hormones prolactin and growth hormone have also been associated with breast cancer. Although the role of these pituitary hormones in breast cancers has been studied, it has not been investigated extensively. In this review, we attempt to compile basic information from most of the currently available literature to understand and demonstrate the significance of growth hormone in breast cancer. Based on the available literature, it is clear that growth hormone plays a significant role in the development, progression, and metastasis of breast cancer by influencing tumor angiogenesis, stemness, and chemoresistance."
2022,Intelligent Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Breast Cancer Detection,"Breast cancer (BC) is a type of tumor that develops in the breast cells and is one of the most common cancers in women. Women are also at risk from BC, the second most life-threatening disease after lung cancer. The early diagnosis and classification of BC are very important. Furthermore, manual detection is time-consuming, laborious work, and, possibility of pathologist errors, and incorrect classification. To address the above highlighted issues, this paper presents a hybrid deep learning (CNN-GRU) model for the automatic detection of BC-IDC (+,−) using whole slide images (WSIs) of the well-known PCam Kaggle dataset. In this research, the proposed model used different layers of architectures of CNNs and GRU to detect breast IDC (+,−) cancer. The validation tests for quantitative results were carried out using each performance measure (accuracy (Acc), precision (Prec), sensitivity (Sens), specificity (Spec), AUC and F1-Score. The proposed model shows the best performance measures (accuracy 86.21%, precision 85.50%, sensitivity 85.60%, specificity 84.71%, F1-score 88%, while AUC 0.89 which overcomes the pathologist’s error and miss classification problem. Additionally, the efficiency of the proposed hybrid model was tested and compared with CNN-BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and current machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) models, which indicated that the proposed hybrid model is more robust than recent ML/DL approaches."
2019,Breast Cancer Detection in the IOT Health Environment Using Modified Recursive Feature Selection,"The accurate and efficient diagnosis of breast cancer is extremely necessary for recovery and treatment in early stages in IoT healthcare environment. Internet of Things has witnessed the transition in life for the last few years which provides a way to analyze both the real-time data and past data by the emerging role of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques. The current state-of-the-art method does not effectively diagnose the breast cancer in the early stages, and most of the ladies suffered from this dangerous disease. Thus, the early detection of breast cancer significantly poses a great challenge for medical experts and researchers. To solve the problem of early-stage detection of breast cancer, we proposed machine learning-based diagnostic system which effectively classifies the malignant and benign people in the environment of IoT. In the development of our proposed system, a machine learning classifier support vector machine is used to classify the malignant and benign people. To improve the classification performance of the classification system, we used a recursive feature selection algorithm to select more suitable features from the breast cancer dataset. The training/testing splits method is applied for training and testing of the classifier for the best predictive model. Additionally, the classifier performance has been checked on by using performance evaluation metrics such as classification, specificity, sensitivity, Matthews’s correlation coefficient, F1-score, and execution time. To test the proposed method, the dataset “Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer” has been used in this research study. The experimental results demonstrate that the recursive feature selection algorithm selects the best subset of features, and the classifier SVM achieved optimal classification performance on this best subset of features. The SVM kernel linear achieved high classification accuracy (99%), specificity (99%), and sensitivity (98%), and the Matthews’s correlation coefficient is 99%. From these experimental results, we concluded that the proposed system performance is excellent due to the selection of more appropriate features that are selected by the recursive feature selection algorithm. Furthermore, we suggest this proposed system for effective and efficient early stages diagnosis of breast cancer. Thus, through this system, the recovery and treatment will be more effective for breast cancer. Lastly, the implementation of the proposed system is very reliable in all aspects of IoT healthcare for breast cancer."
2020,Emerging Technologies for Real‐Time Intraoperative Margin Assessment in Future Breast‐Conserving Surgery,"Clean surgical margins in breast‐conserving surgery (BCS) are essential for preventing recurrence. Intraoperative pathologic diagnostic methods, such as frozen section analysis and imprint cytology, have been recognized as crucial tools in BCS. However, the complexity and time‐consuming nature of these pathologic procedures still inhibit their broader applicability worldwide. To address this situation, two issues should be considered: 1) the development of nonpathologic intraoperative diagnosis methods that have better sensitivity, specificity, speed, and cost; and 2) the promotion of new imaging algorithms to standardize data for analyzing positive margins, as represented by artificial intelligence (AI), without the need for judgment by well‐trained pathologists. Researchers have attempted to develop new methods or techniques; several have recently emerged for real‐time intraoperative management of breast margins in live tissues. These methods include conventional imaging, spectroscopy, tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, microscopy, fluorescent probes, and multimodal imaging techniques. This work summarizes the traditional pathologic and newly developed techniques and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each method. Taking into consideration the recent advances in analyzing pathologic data from breast cancer tissue with AI, the combined use of new technologies with AI algorithms is proposed, and future directions for real‐time intraoperative margin assessment in BCS are discussed."
2019,Corilagin in Cancer: A Critical Evaluation of Anticancer Activities and Molecular Mechanisms,"Corilagin (β-1-O-galloyl-3,6-(R)-hexahydroxydiphenoyl-d-glucose), an ellagitannin, is one of the major bioactive compounds present in various plants. Ellagitannins belong to the hydrolyzable tannins, a group of polyphenols. Corilagin shows broad-spectrum biological, and therapeutic activities, such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and antitumor actions. Natural compounds possessing antitumor activities have attracted significant attention for treatment of cancer. Corilagin has shown inhibitory activity against the growth of numerous cancer cells by prompting cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and augmented apoptosis. Corilagin-induced apoptosis and autophagic cell death depends on production of intracellular reactive oxygen species in breast cancer cell line. It blocks the activation of both the canonical Smad and non-canonical extracellular-signal-regulated kinase/Akt (protein kinase B) pathways. The potential apoptotic action of corilagin is mediated by altered expression of procaspase-3, procaspase-8, procaspase-9, poly (ADP ribose) polymerase, and Bcl-2 Bax. In nude mice, corilagin suppressed cholangiocarcinoma growth and downregulated the expression of Notch1 and mammalian target of rapamycin. The aim of this review is to summarize the anticancer efficacy of corilagin with an emphasis on the molecular mechanisms involving various signaling pathways in tumor cells."
2018,Postmenopausal Osteoporosis: A Clinical Review.,"In postmenopausal women, osteoporotic fractures are more common than stroke, myocardial infarction, and breast cancer combined, and fractures can be costly and result in disability or death. Because there are no signs or symptoms of osteoporosis other than fracture, risk assessment is necessary to identify those at higher risk for clinical events. For women, a clinical fracture risk assessment (FRAX) is appropriate at menopause. Bone mineral density (BMD) measurement is recommended for women at age 65, and earlier for those who have risk factors. Adequate calcium, vitamin D, and weight-bearing exercise are important for bone health at all ages, and those at high risk for fracture based on BMD or FRAX should be offered medical therapy to reduce fracture risk after an appropriate medical evaluation. Bisphosphonates can accumulate in bone, so after a period of treatment, lower risk patients may be offered a period off drug therapy. However, the effects of denosumab are not sustained when treatment is discontinued, so there is no ""drug holiday"" with denosumab. Anabolic therapy can be offered to those with higher risk for fracture. Although rare safety concerns regarding atypical femoral fracture and osteonecrosis of the jaw have received prominent attention, for patients who are appropriately treated according to National Osteoporosis Foundation guidelines, the benefit of hip fracture risk reduction far outweighs the risk of these uncommon side effects. Accurate information for patients and shared decision-making are important for acceptance and persistent with appropriate treatment."
2022,Prediction of Breast Cancer using Machine Learning Approaches,"Background: Breast cancer is considered one of the most common cancers in women caused by various clinical, lifestyle, social, and economic factors. Machine learning has the potential to predict breast cancer based on features hidden in data. Objective: This study aimed to predict breast cancer using different machine-learning approaches applying demographic, laboratory, and mammographic data. Material and Methods: In this analytical study, the database, including 5,178 independent records, 25% of which belonged to breast cancer patients with 24 attributes in each record was obtained from Motamed cancer institute (ACECR), Tehran, Iran. The database contained 5,178 independent records, 25% of which belonged to breast cancer patients containing 24 attributes in each record. The random forest (RF), neural network (MLP), gradient boosting trees (GBT), and genetic algorithms (GA) were used in this study. Models were initially trained with demographic and laboratory features (20 features). The models were then trained with all demographic, laboratory, and mammographic features (24 features) to measure the effectiveness of mammography features in predicting breast cancer. Results: RF presented higher performance compared to other techniques (accuracy 80%, sensitivity 95%, specificity 80%, and the area under the curve (AUC) 0.56). Gradient boosting (AUC=0.59) showed a stronger performance compared to the neural network. Conclusion: Combining multiple risk factors in modeling for breast cancer prediction could help the early diagnosis of the disease with necessary care plans. Collection, storage, and management of different data and intelligent systems based on multiple factors for predicting breast cancer are effective in disease management."
2022,Diagnosis and prognosis of breast cancer by high-performance serum metabolic fingerprints,"Significance Breast cancer (BrCa) is the most common cancer worldwide, and high-performance metabolic analysis is emerging in diagnosis and prognosis of BrCa. Here, we used nanoparticle-enhanced laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry to record serum metabolic fingerprints of BrCa in seconds, achieving high reproducibility and low consumption of direct serum detection. Our analytical method, combined with the aid of machine learning algorithms, was demonstrated to provide high diagnostic efficiency with accuracy of 88.8% and desirable prognostic prediction (P < 0.005). Furthermore, seven metabolic biomarkers differentially enriched in BrCa serum and their related pathways were identified. Together, our findings provide a tool to characterize BrCa and highlight certain metabolic signatures as potential diagnostic and prognostic factors of diseases including but not limited to BrCa."
2014,miR-342 Regulates BRCA1 Expression through Modulation of ID4 in Breast Cancer,"A miRNAs profiling on a group of familial and sporadic breast cancers showed that miRNA-342 was significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER) levels. To investigate at functional level the role of miR-342 in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, we focused our attention on its “in silico” predicted putative target gene ID4, a transcription factor of the helix-loop-helix protein family whose expression is inversely correlated with that of ER. ID4 is expressed in breast cancer and can negatively regulate BRCA1 expression. Our results showed an inverse correlation between ID4 and miR-342 as well as between ID4 and BRCA1 expression. We functionally validated the interaction between ID4 and miR-342 in a reporter Luciferase system. Based on these findings, we hypothesized that regulation of ID4 mediated by miR-342 could be involved in the pathogenesis of breast cancer by downregulating BRCA1 expression. We functionally demonstrated the interactions between miR-342, ID4 and BRCA1 in a model provided by ER-negative MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cell line that presented high levels of ID4. Overexpression of miR-342 in these cells reduced ID4 and increased BRCA1 expression, supporting a possible role of this mechanism in breast cancer. In the ER-positive MCF7 and in the BRCA1-mutant HCC1937 cell lines miR-342 over-expression only reduced ID4. In the cohort of patients we studied, a correlation between miR-342 and BRCA1 expression was found in the ER-negative cases. As ER-negative cases were mainly BRCA1-mutant, we speculate that the mechanism we demonstrated could be involved in the decreased expression of BRCA1 frequently observed in non BRCA1-mutant breast cancers and could be implicated as a causal factor in part of the familial cases grouped in the heterogeneous class of non BRCA1 or BRCA2-mutant cases (BRCAx). To validate this hypothesis, the study should be extended to a larger cohort of ER-negative cases, including those belonging to the BRCAx class."
2019,Breast Cancer Classification in Ultrasound Images using Transfer Learning,"Computer-aided detection of malignant breast tumors in ultrasound images has been receiving growing attention. In this paper, we propose a deep learning methodology to tackle this problem. The training data, which contains several hundred images of benign and malignant cases, was used to train a deep convolutional neural network (CNN). Three training approaches are proposed: a baseline approach where the CNN architecture is trained from scratch, a transfer-learning approach where the pre-trained VGG16 CNN architecture is further trained with the ultrasound images, and a fine-tuned learning approach where the deep learning parameters are fine-tuned to overcome overfitting. The experimental results demonstrate that the fine-tuned model had the best performance (0.97 accuracy, 0.98 AUC), with pre-training on US images. Creating pre-trained models using medical imaging data would certainly improve deep learning outcomes in biomedical applications."
2017,Automated Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning and Region of Interest Detection (BC-DROID),"Detection of suspicious regions in mammogram images and the subsequent diagnosis of these regions remains a challenging problem in the medical world. There still exists an alarming rate of misdiagnosis of breast cancer. This results in both over treatment through incorrect positive diagnosis of cancer and under treatment through overlooked cancerous masses. Convolutional neural networks have shown strong applicability to various image datasets, enabling detailed features to be learned from the data and, as a result, the ability to classify these images at extremely low error rates. In order to overcome the difficulty in diagnosing breast cancer from mammogram images, we propose our framework for automated breast cancer detection and diagnosis, called BC-DROID, which provides automated region of interest detection and diagnosis using convolutional neural networks. BC-DROID first pretrains based on physician-defined regions of interest in mammogram images. It then trains based on the full mammogram image. The resulting network is able to detect and classify regions of interest as cancerous or benign in one step. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework's ability to both locate the regions of interest as well as diagnose them. Our framework achieves a detection accuracy of up to 90% and a classification accuracy of 93.5% (AUC of 92.315%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work enabling both automated detection and diagnosis of these areas in one step from full mammogram images. Using our framework's website, a user can upload a single mammogram image, visualize suspicious regions, and receive the automated diagnoses of these regions."
2019,"Biogenic Nanoparticle‒Chitosan Conjugates with Antimicrobial, Antibiofilm, and Anticancer Potentialities: Development and Characterization","In the 21st century, with ever-increasing consciousness and social awareness, researchers must tackle the microbial infections that pose a major threat to human safety. For many reasons, the emergence/re-emergence of threatening pathogens has increased and poses a serious challenge to health care services. Considering the changing dynamics of 21st-century materials with medical potentialities, the integration of bioactive agents into materials to engineer antibacterial matrices has received limited attention so far. Thus, antimicrobial active conjugates are considered potential candidates to eradicate infections and reduce microbial contaminations in healthcare facilities. In this context, eco-friendly and novel conjugates with antimicrobial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities were developed using biogenic silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) from Convolvulus arvensis (C. arvensis) extract and chitosan (CHI). A range of instrumental and imaging tools, i.e., UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDX), and X-ray diffraction (XRD), were employed to characterize the freshly extracted C. arvensis AgNPs. Biogenic AgNPs obtained after a 24-h reaction period were used to engineer CHI-based conjugates and designated as CHI‒AgNPs1 to CHI‒AgNPs5, subject to the C. arvensis AgNPs concentration. After the stipulated loading period, 92% loading efficiency (LE) was recorded for a CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. Gram+ and Gram- bacterial isolates, i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli, were used to test the antibacterial activities of newly developed CHI‒AgNPs conjugates. In comparison to the control sample with bacterial cell count 1.5 × 108 CFU/mL, a notable reduction in the log values was recorded for the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate. The antibiofilm potential of CHI‒AgNPs conjugates was tested against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, the CHI‒AgNPs3 conjugate also showed substantial cytotoxicity against the MCF-7 (breast cancer) cell line. In summary, the newly engineered CHI‒AgNPs conjugates with antibacterial, antibiofilm, and anticancer potentialities are potential candidate materials for biomedical applications."
2016,Non-pharmacological interventions for cognitive impairment due to systemic cancer treatment.,"BACKGROUND It is estimated that up to 75% of cancer survivors may experience cognitive impairment as a result of cancer treatment and given the increasing size of the cancer survivor population, the number of affected people is set to rise considerably in coming years. There is a need, therefore, to identify effective, non-pharmacological interventions for maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment among people with a previous cancer diagnosis. OBJECTIVES To evaluate the cognitive effects, non-cognitive effects, duration and safety of non-pharmacological interventions among cancer patients targeted at maintaining cognitive function or ameliorating cognitive impairment as a result of cancer or receipt of systemic cancer treatment (i.e. chemotherapy or hormonal therapies in isolation or combination with other treatments). SEARCH METHODS We searched the Cochrane Centre Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, Embase, PUBMED, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and PsycINFO databases. We also searched registries of ongoing trials and grey literature including theses, dissertations and conference proceedings. Searches were conducted for articles published from 1980 to 29 September 2015. SELECTION CRITERIA Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of non-pharmacological interventions to improve cognitive impairment or to maintain cognitive functioning among survivors of adult-onset cancers who have completed systemic cancer therapy (in isolation or combination with other treatments) were eligible. Studies among individuals continuing to receive hormonal therapy were included. We excluded interventions targeted at cancer survivors with central nervous system (CNS) tumours or metastases, non-melanoma skin cancer or those who had received cranial radiation or, were from nursing or care home settings. Language restrictions were not applied. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS Author pairs independently screened, selected, extracted data and rated the risk of bias of studies. We were unable to conduct planned meta-analyses due to heterogeneity in the type of interventions and outcomes, with the exception of compensatory strategy training interventions for which we pooled data for mental and physical well-being outcomes. We report a narrative synthesis of intervention effectiveness for other outcomes. MAIN RESULTS Five RCTs describing six interventions (comprising a total of 235 participants) met the eligibility criteria for the review. Two trials of computer-assisted cognitive training interventions (n = 100), two of compensatory strategy training interventions (n = 95), one of meditation (n = 47) and one of physical activity intervention (n = 19) were identified. Each study focused on breast cancer survivors. All five studies were rated as having a high risk of bias. Data for our primary outcome of interest, cognitive function were not amenable to being pooled statistically. Cognitive training demonstrated beneficial effects on objectively assessed cognitive function (including processing speed, executive functions, cognitive flexibility, language, delayed- and immediate- memory), subjectively reported cognitive function and mental well-being. Compensatory strategy training demonstrated improvements on objectively assessed delayed-, immediate- and verbal-memory, self-reported cognitive function and spiritual quality of life (QoL). The meta-analyses of two RCTs (95 participants) did not show a beneficial effect from compensatory strategy training on physical well-being immediately (standardised mean difference (SMD) 0.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.59 to 0.83; I(2)= 67%) or two months post-intervention (SMD - 0.21, 95% CI -0.89 to 0.47; I(2) = 63%) or on mental well-being two months post-intervention (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -1.10 to 0.34; I(2) = 67%). Lower mental well-being immediately post-intervention appeared to be observed in patients who received compensatory strategy training compared to wait-list controls (SMD -0.57, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.16; I(2) = 0%). We assessed the assembled studies using GRADE for physical and mental health outcomes and this evidence was rated to be low quality and, therefore findings should be interpreted with caution. Evidence for physical activity and meditation interventions on cognitive outcomes is unclear. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS Overall, the, albeit low-quality evidence may be interpreted to suggest that non-pharmacological interventions may have the potential to reduce the risk of, or ameliorate, cognitive impairment following systemic cancer treatment. Larger, multi-site studies including an appropriate, active attentional control group, as well as consideration of functional outcomes (e.g. activities of daily living) are required in order to come to firmer conclusions about the benefits or otherwise of this intervention approach. There is also a need to conduct research into cognitive impairment among cancer patient groups other than women with breast cancer."
2022,Improved Machine Learning-Based Predictive Models for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Breast cancer death rates are higher than any other cancer in American women. Machine learning-based predictive models promise earlier detection techniques for breast cancer diagnosis. However, making an evaluation for models that efficiently diagnose cancer is still challenging. In this work, we proposed data exploratory techniques (DET) and developed four different predictive models to improve breast cancer diagnostic accuracy. Prior to models, four-layered essential DET, e.g., feature distribution, correlation, elimination, and hyperparameter optimization, were deep-dived to identify the robust feature classification into malignant and benign classes. These proposed techniques and classifiers were implemented on the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) and Breast Cancer Coimbra Dataset (BCCD) datasets. Standard performance metrics, including confusion matrices and K-fold cross-validation techniques, were applied to assess each classifier’s efficiency and training time. The models’ diagnostic capability improved with our DET, i.e., polynomial SVM gained 99.3%, LR with 98.06%, KNN acquired 97.35%, and EC achieved 97.61% accuracy with the WDBC dataset. We also compared our significant results with previous studies in terms of accuracy. The implementation procedure and findings can guide physicians to adopt an effective model for a practical understanding and prognosis of breast cancer tumors."
2021,Multi- class classification of breast cancer abnormalities using Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN),"The real cause of breast cancer is very challenging to determine and therefore early detection of the disease is necessary for reducing the death rate due to risks of breast cancer. Early detection of cancer boosts increasing the survival chance up to 8%. Primarily, breast images emanating from mammograms, X-Rays or MRI are analyzed by radiologists to detect abnormalities. However, even experienced radiologists face problems in identifying features like micro-calcifications, lumps and masses, leading to high false positive and high false negative. Recent advancement in image processing and deep learning create some hopes in devising more enhanced applications that can be used for the early detection of breast cancer. In this work, we have developed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to segment and classify the various types of breast abnormalities, such as calcifications, masses, asymmetry and carcinomas, unlike existing research work, which mainly classified the cancer into benign and malignant, leading to improved disease management. Firstly, a transfer learning was carried out on our dataset using the pre-trained model ResNet50. Along similar lines, we have developed an enhanced deep learning model, in which learning rate is considered as one of the most important attributes while training the neural network. The learning rate is set adaptively in our proposed model based on changes in error curves during the learning process involved. The proposed deep learning model has achieved a performance of 88% in the classification of these four types of breast cancer abnormalities such as, masses, calcifications, carcinomas and asymmetry mammograms."
2017,CuS-Based Theranostic Micelles for NIR-Controlled Combination Chemotherapy and Photothermal Therapy and Photoacoustic Imaging.,"Cancer remains a major threat to human health due to low therapeutic efficacies of currently available cancer treatment options. Nanotheranostics, capable of simultaneous therapy and diagnosis/monitoring of diseases, has attracted increasing amounts of attention, particularly for cancer treatment. In this study, CuS-based theranostic micelles capable of simultaneous combination chemotherapy and photothermal therapy (PTT), as well as photoacoustic imaging, were developed for targeted cancer therapy. The micelle was formed by a CuS nanoparticle (NP) functionalized by thermosensitive amphiphilic poly(acrylamide-acrylonitrile)-poly(ethylene glycol) block copolymers. CuS NPs under near-infrared (NIR) irradiation induced a significant temperature elevation, thereby enabling NIR-triggered PTT. Moreover, the hydrophobic core formed by poly(acrylamide-acrylonitrile) segments used for drug encapsulation exhibited an upper critical solution temperature (UCST; ∼38 °C), which underwent a hydrophobic-to-hydrophilic transition once the temperature rose above the UCST induced by NIR-irradiated CuS NPs, thereby triggering a rapid drug release and enabling NIR-controlled chemotherapy. The CuS-based micelles conjugated with GE11 peptides were tested in an epidermal growth factor receptor-overexpressing triple-negative breast cancer model. In both two-dimensional monolayer cell and three-dimensional multicellular tumor spheroid models, GE11-tagged CuS-based micelles under NIR irradiation, enabling the combination chemotherapy and PTT, exhibited the best therapeutic outcome due to a synergistic effect. These CuS-based micelles also displayed a good photoacoustic imaging ability under NIR illumination. Taken together, this multifunctional CuS-based micelle could be a promising nanoplatform for targeted cancer nanotheranostics."
2022,Classification of Breast Cancer Nottingham Prognostic Index Using High-Dimensional Embedding and Residual Neural Network,"Simple Summary A deep learning model based on multi-omics data to classify Nottingham prognostic Index score levels. The model represents each omic dataset using 2-dimensional map before integrating all omics maps into the prediction model. The literature confirms the relationship between the extracted omics features with the progression and survival of breast cancer. Abstract The Nottingham Prognostics Index (NPI) is a prognostics measure that predicts operable primary breast cancer survival. The NPI value is calculated based on the size of the tumor, the number of lymph nodes, and the tumor grade. Next-generation sequencing advancements have led to measuring different biological indicators called multi-omics data. The availability of multi-omics data triggered the challenge of integrating and analyzing these various biological measures to understand the progression of the diseases. High-dimensional embedding techniques are incorporated to present the features in the lower dimension, i.e., in a 2-dimensional map. The dataset consists of three -omics: gene expression, copy number alteration (CNA), and mRNA from 1885 female patients. The model creates a gene similarity network (GSN) map for each omic using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) before being merged into the residual neural network (ResNet) classification model. The aim of this work was to (i) extract multi-omics biomarkers that are associated with the prognosis and prediction of breast cancer survival; and (ii) build a prediction model for multi-class breast cancer NPI classes. We evaluated this model and compared it to different high-dimensional embedding techniques and neural network combinations. The proposed model outperformed the other methods with an accuracy of 98.48%, and the area under the curve (AUC) equals 0.9999. The findings in the literature confirm associations between some of the extracted omics and breast cancer prognosis and survival including CDCA5, IL17RB, MUC2, NOD2 and NXPH4 from the gene expression dataset; MED30, RAD21, EIF3H and EIF3E from the CNA dataset; and CENPA, MACF1, UGT2B7 and SEMA3B from the mRNA dataset."
2016,Risk factors of trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer,"Background:Trastuzumab targets the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 oncogene and in combination with first-line therapy results in significantly improved survival outcomes and has thus become standard of care in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. While it is estimated that 1% to 4% of patients treated with trastuzumab will develop heart failure and ∼10% will experience a reduction in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), the patient risk factors associated with trastuzumab-induced cardiotoxicity (TIC) are unclear. This meta-analysis aims to consolidate previously published data to identify the risk factors most likely leading to TIC. Methods:A search of the MEDLINE literature database using the keywords trastuzumab/Herceptin, risk factors, outcomes, cardiac, cardiotoxicity, cardiomyopathy, LVEF, and chemotherapy was performed. Only prospective/retrospective human studies were included, with additional studies excluded if they reported baseline LVEF > 68%, a cohort of <50 patients, or results that were not stratified based on cardiotoxic events. Pooled odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for each potential risk factor were calculated, with heterogeneity of data and samples explored using random-effects modeling. Results:Data were collected from 17 articles, capturing 6527 patients. Hypertension (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.14–2.26; P < 0.01), diabetes (OR 1.62; 95% CI 1.10–2.38; P < 0.02), previous anthracycline use (OR 2.14; 95% CI 1.17–3.92; P < 0.02), and older age (P = 0.013) were all shown to be associated with TIC. Conclusion:Cardiac performance should be closely monitored in women treated with trastuzumab. Recognizing potential risk factors along with careful attention to symptoms/LVEF measurements could minimize the occurrence of TIC in this population."
2018,Using Random Forest Algorithm for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"In the current health care field, benefit from the provision of medical big data, machine learning can be used to obtain knowledge from the data. Machine learning methods can describe cases from an objective perspective, and predictions of diagnostic results can be generated from a combination of related pathological factors. The introduction of machine learning for the way of medical diagnosis and the accuracy of diagnosis is a major change and inevitable direction of the future medical model. In this paper, the random forest algorithm is used to analyze the medical case diagnosis of breast cancer. The random forest algorithm can combine the characteristics of multiple eigenvalues, and the combined results of multiple decision trees can be used to improve the prediction accuracy. Based on the ensemble learning method of random forests, the results of multiple weak classifiers can be combined to produce accurate classification results. In this paper, a random forest algorithm is used to discuss the case of breast cancer case diagnosis and obtain high prediction accuracy. It has practical significance for auxiliary medical diagnosis."
2022,A Systematic Method for Breast Cancer Classification using RFE Feature Selection,"Breast cancer is among leading reasons for the deaths of women globally. Machine learning techniques can help to classify breast cancer based on some features. In order to find a systematic method for breast cancer classification, authors have compared the performance of four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF) on Wisconsin Breast Cancer Original (WBCO) dataset. The classifiers were used alone as well as along with techniques of feature selection. The performance with regard to accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision, and F -Measure, was compared for both types of experiments: classification with feature selection and without feature selection. The Recursive Feature Selection (RFE) technique was applied to select promising features out of available features. There was a significant increase in the performance of classifiers after using the RFE technique. KNN with feature selection provided the highest accuracy (98.31 %) among all other classifiers."
2014,Anthracyclines and taxanes in the neo/adjuvant treatment of breast cancer: does the sequence matter?,"BACKGROUND In early breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy decreases the risks of recurrence and breast cancer mortality, and neoadjuvant treatment leads to equivalent long-term outcomes. A large number of clinical trials have attempted to refine systemic therapeutic strategies in early breast cancer, but little attention has been paid to the sequence of anthracyclines and taxanes. Based on preclinical observations, there is limited rationale to administer the taxane before the anthracycline. METHODS We searched PubMed, the American Society of Clinical Oncology website, and clinicaltrials.gov with the goal of identifying published or ongoing studies that aimed at comparing reverse sequences of anthracyclines and taxanes. Given the nature and the small number of studies identified, we did not attempt to quantitatively pool the study results. RESULTS We retrieved seven studies in the adjuvant setting and eight in the neoadjuvant setting: 10 randomized trials (only 2 were phase IIII), 3 retrospective studies, and 2 ongoing phase II trials. A total of nearly 5000 patients were included in such studies. None of the clinical trials has shown disadvantages in terms of efficacy or toxicity for sequences in which the taxane was administered first. In the neoadjuvant setting, studies have collectively shown similar or increased pathological complete response rates for sequences in which the taxane was administered first. CONCLUSION Given the available information, there seems to be sufficient evidence to suggest that a taxane followed by an anthracycline is a sequence option that can be incorporated into daily clinical practice."
2020,Histopathological Classification of Breast Cancer Images Using a Multi-Scale Input and Multi-Feature Network,"Diagnosis of pathologies using histopathological images can be time-consuming when many images with different magnification levels need to be analyzed. State-of-the-art computer vision and machine learning methods can help automate the diagnostic pathology workflow and thus reduce the analysis time. Automated systems can also be more efficient and accurate, and can increase the objectivity of diagnosis by reducing operator variability. We propose a multi-scale input and multi-feature network (MSI-MFNet) model, which can learn the overall structures and texture features of different scale tissues by fusing multi-resolution hierarchical feature maps from the network’s dense connectivity structure. The MSI-MFNet predicts the probability of a disease on the patch and image levels. We evaluated the performance of our proposed model on two public benchmark datasets. Furthermore, through ablation studies of the model, we found that multi-scale input and multi-feature maps play an important role in improving the performance of the model. Our proposed model outperformed the existing state-of-the-art models by demonstrating better accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity."
2017,Convolutional Neural Network for Histopathological Analysis of Osteosarcoma,"Pathologists often deal with high complexity and sometimes disagreement over osteosarcoma tumor classification due to cellular heterogeneity in the dataset. Segmentation and classification of histology tissue in H&E stained tumor image datasets is a challenging task because of intra-class variations, inter-class similarity, crowded context, and noisy data. In recent years, deep learning approaches have led to encouraging results in breast cancer and prostate cancer analysis. In this article, we propose convolutional neural network (CNN) as a tool to improve efficiency and accuracy of osteosarcoma tumor classification into tumor classes (viable tumor, necrosis) versus nontumor. The proposed CNN architecture contains eight learned layers: three sets of stacked two convolutional layers interspersed with max pooling layers for feature extraction and two fully connected layers with data augmentation strategies to boost performance. The use of a neural network results in higher accuracy of average 92% for the classification. We compare the proposed architecture with three existing and proven CNN architectures for image classification: AlexNet, LeNet, and VGGNet. We also provide a pipeline to calculate percentage necrosis in a given whole slide image. We conclude that the use of neural networks can assure both high accuracy and efficiency in osteosarcoma classification."
2016,Text mining for precision medicine: automating disease-mutation relationship extraction from biomedical literature,"OBJECTIVE Identifying disease-mutation relationships is a significant challenge in the advancement of precision medicine. The aim of this work is to design a tool that automates the extraction of disease-related mutations from biomedical text to advance database curation for the support of precision medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS We developed a machine-learning (ML) based method to automatically identify the mutations mentioned in the biomedical literature related to a particular disease. In order to predict a relationship between the mutation and the target disease, several features, such as statistical features, distance features, and sentiment features, were constructed. Our ML model was trained with a pre-labeled dataset consisting of manually curated information about mutation-disease associations. The model was subsequently used to extract disease-related mutations from larger biomedical literature corpora. RESULTS The performance of the proposed approach was assessed using a benchmarking dataset. Results show that our proposed approach gains significant improvement over the previous state of the art and obtains F-measures of 0.880 and 0.845 for prostate and breast cancer mutations, respectively. DISCUSSION To demonstrate its utility, we applied our approach to all abstracts in PubMed for 3 diseases (including a non-cancer disease). The mutations extracted were then manually validated against human-curated databases. The validation results show that the proposed approach is useful in a real-world setting to extract uncurated disease mutations from the biomedical literature. CONCLUSIONS The proposed approach improves the state of the art for mutation-disease extraction from text. It is scalable and generalizable to identify mutations for any disease at a PubMed scale."
2019,Prediction of Malignant & Benign Breast Cancer: A Data Mining Approach in Healthcare Applications,"As much as data science is playing a pivotal role everywhere, healthcare also finds it prominent application. Breast Cancer is the top rated type of cancer amongst women; which took away 627,000 lives alone. This high mortality rate due to breast cancer does need attention, for early detection so that prevention can be done in time. As a potential contributor to state-of-art technology development, data mining finds a multi-fold application in predicting Brest cancer. This work focuses on different classification techniques implementation for data mining in predicting malignant and benign breast cancer. Breast Cancer Wisconsin data set from the UCI repository has been used as experimental dataset while attribute clump thickness being used as an evaluation class. The performances of these twelve algorithms: Ada Boost M 1, Decision Table, J Rip, Lazy IBK, Logistics Regression, Multiclass Classifier, Multilayer Perceptron, Naive Bayes, Random forest and Random Tree are analyzed on this data set. Keywords- Data Mining, Classification Techniques, UCI repository, Breast Cancer, Classification Algorithms"
2019,On the Scalability of Machine-Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Prediction in Big Data Context,"Recent advances in information technology have induced an explosive growth of data, creating a new era of big data. Unfortunately, traditional machine-learning algorithms cannot cope with the new characteristics of big data. In this paper, we address the problem of breast cancer prediction in the big data context. We considered two varieties of data, namely, gene expression (GE) and DNA methylation (DM). The objective of this paper is to scale up the machine-learning algorithms that are used for classification by applying each dataset separately and jointly. For this purpose, we chose Apache Spark as a platform. In this paper, we selected three different classification algorithms, namely, support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, and random forest, to create nine models that help in predicting breast cancer. We conducted a comprehensive comparative study using three scenarios with the GE, DM, and GE and DM combined, in order to show which of the three types of data would produce the best result in terms of accuracy and error rate. Moreover, we performed an experimental comparison between two platforms (Spark and Weka) in order to show their behavior when dealing with large sets of data. The experimental results showed that the scaled SVM classifier in the Spark environment outperforms the other classifiers, as it achieved the highest accuracy and the lowest error rate with the GE dataset."
2021,Doxorubicin-Induced Cognitive Impairment: The Mechanistic Insights,"Chemotherapy can significantly prolong the survival of patients with breast cancer; Nevertheless, the majority of patients receiving chemotherapy such as doxorubicin may have cognitive deficits that manifest as impairments in learning, reasoning, attention, and memory. The phenomenon of chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline is termed as chemotherapy-related cognitive impairment (CRCI) or chemo-brain. Doxorubicin (DOX), a commonly used drug in adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with breast cancer, has been reported to induce chemo-brain through a variety of mechanisms including DNA damage, oxidative stress, inflammation, dysregulation of apoptosis and autophagy, changes in neurotransmitter levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, glial cell interactions, neurogenesis inhibition, and epigenetic factors. These mechanisms do not operate independently but are inter-related, coordinately contributing to the development of chemo-brain. Here we review the relationships of these mechanisms and pathways in attempt to provide mechanistic insights into the doxorubicin-induced cognitive impairment."
2018,Altered glutamine metabolism in breast cancer; subtype dependencies and alternative adaptations,"Cancer cells must alter their metabolism in order to satisfy the demands of necessary energy and cellular building blocks. These metabolic alterations are mediated by many oncogenic changes that affect cellular signalling pathways, which result in sustained cell growth and proliferation. Recently, metabolomics has received great attention in the field of cancer research, and as the essential metabolic pathways that drive tumour growth and progression are determined the possibilities of new targets for therapeutic intervention are opened. More specifically, as breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, there is growing evidence that differences in metabolic changes exist between molecular subtypes. In this review, the most recent findings in breast cancer cell metabolism are discussed, with particular emphasis on glutamine and its transporters, which is considered one of the key amino acids fuelling cancer growth. Furthermore, the metabolic differences between the molecular subtypes of breast cancer are examined, highlighting the clinical utility for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment."
2017,Controversies about fertility and pregnancy issues in young breast cancer patients: current state of the art,"Purpose of review For trying to help physicians in counseling their young patients with breast cancer interested in fertility preservation and future reproductive plans, this manuscript aims to perform an overview of the main available data on 10 controversies in this field. Recent findings Thanks to the improvement in patients’ prognosis, a growing attention towards fertility and pregnancy issues has been given over the past years and is currently provided to young breast cancer patients. However, several grey zones persist in many domains of this field and some physicians are still uncomfortable to deal with these issues. Summary Despite the great number of breast cancer patients experiencing fertility and pregnancy concerns at the time of diagnosis, the pursuit of fertility preserving strategies is realized only for a small proportion of them. The lack of adequate oncofertility counseling at the time of anticancer treatment decisions and the high costs of fertility preserving procedures can be considered the main explanations for these findings. The several ongoing registries and prospective studies investigating fertility and pregnancy issues in young breast cancer patients are crucial to acquire more robust data and try to address and solve the still unmet controversies in this field."
2021,NuCLS: A scalable crowdsourcing approach and dataset for nucleus classification and segmentation in breast cancer,"Abstract Background Deep learning enables accurate high-resolution mapping of cells and tissue structures that can serve as the foundation of interpretable machine-learning models for computational pathology. However, generating adequate labels for these structures is a critical barrier, given the time and effort required from pathologists. Results This article describes a novel collaborative framework for engaging crowds of medical students and pathologists to produce quality labels for cell nuclei. We used this approach to produce the NuCLS dataset, containing >220,000 annotations of cell nuclei in breast cancers. This builds on prior work labeling tissue regions to produce an integrated tissue region- and cell-level annotation dataset for training that is the largest such resource for multi-scale analysis of breast cancer histology. This article presents data and analysis results for single and multi-rater annotations from both non-experts and pathologists. We present a novel workflow that uses algorithmic suggestions to collect accurate segmentation data without the need for laborious manual tracing of nuclei. Our results indicate that even noisy algorithmic suggestions do not adversely affect pathologist accuracy and can help non-experts improve annotation quality. We also present a new approach for inferring truth from multiple raters and show that non-experts can produce accurate annotations for visually distinctive classes. Conclusions This study is the most extensive systematic exploration of the large-scale use of wisdom-of-the-crowd approaches to generate data for computational pathology applications."
2017,Use of Complementary Traditional Chinese Medicines by Adult Cancer Patients in Taiwan: A Nationwide Population-Based Study,"Background. Many patients with cancer seek complementary and alternative medicine treatments. We investigated the use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) by adult cancer patients in Taiwan. Methods. We reviewed the Registry for Catastrophic Illness Patients Database of Taiwan, and included all adult patients diagnosed cancer, based on the International Classification of Diseases (ninth revision), from 2001 to 2009 and followed until 2011. This database allowed categorization of patients as TCM users (n = 74 620) or non-TCM users (n = 508 179). All demographic and clinical claims data were analyzed. Results. Compared with non-TCM users, TCM users were younger and more likely to be female, white-collar workers, and reside in highly urbanized areas. The average interval between cancer diagnosis and TCM consultation was 15.3 months. The most common cancer type was breast cancer in TCM users (19.4%), and intrahepatic bile duct cancer in non-TCM users (13.6%). The major condition for which TCM users visited clinics were endocrine, nutritional and metabolic diseases, and immunity disorders (23.2%). A total of 33.1% of TCM users visited TCM clinics more than 9 times per year and their time from diagnosis to first TCM consultation was 5.14 months. The most common TCM treatment was Chinese herbal medicine. The common diseases for which cancer patients sought TCM treatment were insomnia, malaise and fatigue, dizziness and headache, gastrointestinal disorders, myalgia and fasciitis, anxiety, and depression. Overall, TCM users had a lower adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for mortality (aHR = 0.69, 95% CI = 0.68-0.70) after adjustment for age, sex, urbanization of residence, occupation, annual medical center visits, and annual non–medical center visits. Conclusions. This study provides an overview of TCM usage among adult cancer patients in Taiwan. TCM use varied among patients with different types of cancer. Physicians caring for cancer patients should pay more attention to their patients’ use of complementary TCM."
2022,Histopathologic Oral Cancer Prediction Using Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Biopsy Empowered with Transfer Learning,"Oral cancer is a dangerous and extensive cancer with a high death ratio. Oral cancer is the most usual cancer in the world, with more than 300,335 deaths every year. The cancerous tumor appears in the neck, oral glands, face, and mouth. To overcome this dangerous cancer, there are many ways to detect like a biopsy, in which small chunks of tissues are taken from the mouth and tested under a secure and hygienic microscope. However, microscope results of tissues to detect oral cancer are not up to the mark, a microscope cannot easily identify the cancerous cells and normal cells. Detection of cancerous cells using microscopic biopsy images helps in allaying and predicting the issues and gives better results if biologically approaches apply accurately for the prediction of cancerous cells, but during the physical examinations microscopic biopsy images for cancer detection there are major chances for human error and mistake. So, with the development of technology deep learning algorithms plays a major role in medical image diagnosing. Deep learning algorithms are efficiently developed to predict breast cancer, oral cancer, lung cancer, or any other type of medical image. In this study, the proposed model of transfer learning model using AlexNet in the convolutional neural network to extract rank features from oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) biopsy images to train the model. Simulation results have shown that the proposed model achieved higher classification accuracy 97.66% and 90.06% of training and testing, respectively."
2014,An update on the medical management of breast cancer,"#### Summary points Breast cancer remained the most common cancer in women in 2013 and its incidence continues to rise.1 Nonetheless, mortality is falling, partly as a result of earlier diagnosis through mammographic screening,2 improved surgical techniques and attention to margins, improved delivery of radiotherapy, and better adjuvant medical therapies (fig 1⇓). Despite these improvements, breast cancer remains the second most common cause of death from cancer in women. Fig 1 Incidence of breast cancer in women and mortality rates in the United Kingdom over the past 30 years. Data from Cancer Research UK1 This review focuses on the medical treatment of breast cancer in the adjuvant and metastatic settings, with particular attention to recent advances and changes in practice since our last review in 2008.3 4 We discuss how targeted therapies can be used to individualise and tailor the management of breast cancer according to tumour biology and molecular subtype. #### Sources and selection criteria We used PubMed to identify recent published updates on the medical management of breast cancer. We also referenced presentations from international conferences and consulted with other experts in the breast cancer field. ### Diagnosis Guidelines on the diagnosis of early breast cancer have changed little since our last review. Population based mammography screening for asymptomatic women is currently …"
2019,Validation of miRNAs as Breast Cancer Biomarkers with a Machine Learning Approach,"Certain small noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) are differentially expressed in normal tissues and cancers, which makes them great candidates for biomarkers for cancer. Previously, a selected subset of miRNAs has been experimentally verified to be linked to breast cancer. In this paper, we validated the importance of these miRNAs using a machine learning approach on miRNA expression data. We performed feature selection, using Information Gain (IG), Chi-Squared (CHI2) and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operation (LASSO), on the set of these relevant miRNAs to rank them by importance. We then performed cancer classification using these miRNAs as features using Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers. Our results demonstrated that the miRNAs ranked higher by our analysis had higher classifier performance. Performance becomes lower as the rank of the miRNA decreases, confirming that these miRNAs had different degrees of importance as biomarkers. Furthermore, we discovered that using a minimum of three miRNAs as biomarkers for breast cancers can be as effective as using the entire set of 1800 miRNAs. This work suggests that machine learning is a useful tool for functional studies of miRNAs for cancer detection and diagnosis."
2020,Deep learning and optimization algorithms for automatic breast cancer detection,"Breast cancer is caused by the abnormal and rapid growth of breast cells. An early diagnosis can ensure an easier and effective treatment. A mass in the breast is a significant early sign of breast cancer, even though differentiating the cancerous mass's tissue from normal tissue for diagnosis is a difficult task for radiologists. The development of computer‐aided detection systems in recent years has led to nondestructive and efficient cancer diagnostic techniques. This paper proposes a comprehensive method to locate the cancerous region in the mammogram image. This method employs image noise reduction, optimal image segmentation based on the convolutional neural network, a grasshopper optimization algorithm, and optimized feature extraction and feature selection based on the grasshopper optimization algorithm, thereby improving precision and decreasing the computational cost. This method was applied to the Mammographic Image Analysis Society Digital Mammogram Database and Digital Database for Screening Mammography breast cancer databases and the simulation results were compared with 10 different state‐of‐the‐art methods to analyze the proposed system's efficiency. Final results showed that the proposed method had 96% Sensitivity, 93% Specificity, 85% PPV, 97% NPV, 92% accuracy, and better efficiency than other traditional methods in terms of Sensitivity, Specificity, PPV, NPV, and Accuracy."
2022,Medical Internet-of-Things Based Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Hyperparameter-Optimized Neural Networks,"In today’s healthcare setting, the accurate and timely diagnosis of breast cancer is critical for recovery and treatment in the early stages. In recent years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has experienced a transformation that allows the analysis of real-time and historical data using artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) approaches. Medical IoT combines medical devices and AI applications with healthcare infrastructure to support medical diagnostics. The current state-of-the-art approach fails to diagnose breast cancer in its initial period, resulting in the death of most women. As a result, medical professionals and researchers are faced with a tremendous problem in early breast cancer detection. We propose a medical IoT-based diagnostic system that competently identifies malignant and benign people in an IoT environment to resolve the difficulty of identifying early-stage breast cancer. The artificial neural network (ANN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) with hyperparameter optimization are used for malignant vs. benign classification, while the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) were utilized as baseline classifiers for comparison. Hyperparameters are important for machine learning algorithms since they directly control the behaviors of training algorithms and have a significant effect on the performance of machine learning models. We employ a particle swarm optimization (PSO) feature selection approach to select more satisfactory features from the breast cancer dataset to enhance the classification performance using MLP and SVM, while grid-based search was used to find the best combination of the hyperparameters of the CNN and ANN models. The Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset was used to test the proposed approach. The proposed model got a classification accuracy of 98.5% using CNN, and 99.2% using ANN."
2019,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches in Breast Cancer Survival Prediction Using Clinical Data.,"Breast cancer survival prediction can have an extreme effect on selection of best treatment protocols. Many approaches such as statistical or machine learning models have been employed to predict the survival prospects of patients, but newer algorithms such as deep learning can be tested with the aim of improving the models and prediction accuracy. In this study, we used machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict breast cancer survival in 4,902 patient records from the University of Malaya Medical Centre Breast Cancer Registry. The results indicated that the multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifiers could predict survivorship, respectively, with 88.2 %, 83.3 % and 82.5 % accuracy in the tested samples. Support vector machine (SVM) came out to be lower with 80.5 %. In this study, tumour size turned out to be the most important feature for breast cancer survivability prediction. Both deep learning and machine learning methods produce desirable prediction accuracy, but other factors such as parameter configurations and data transformations affect the accuracy of the predictive model."
2020,ResNet-SCDA-50 for Breast Abnormality Classification,"(Aim) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women and the second most common cancer worldwide. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, the early stages of breast cancer development can be accurately detected by radiologists with the help of artificial intelligence systems. (Method) Based on mammographic imaging, a mainstream clinical breast screening technique, we present a diagnostic system for accurate classification of breast abnormalities based on ResNet-50. To improve the proposed model, we created a new data augmentation framework called SCDA (Scaling and Contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization Data Augmentation). In its procedure, we first conduct the scaling operation to the original training set, followed by applying contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE) to the scaled training set. By stacking the training set after SCDA with the original training set, we formed a new training set. The network trained by the augmented training set, was coined as ResNet-SCDA-50. Our system, which aims at a binary classification on mammographic images acquired from INbreast and MINI-MIAS, classifies masses, microcalcification as “abnormal”, while normal regions are classified as “normal”. (Results) We present the first attempt to use the image contrast enhancement method as the data augmentation method, resulting in an averaged 98.55 percent specificity and 92.83 percent sensitivity, which gives our best model an overall accuracy of 95.74 percent. (Conclusion) Our proposed method is effective in classifying breast abnormality."
2020,The Ongoing Search for Biomarkers of CDK4/6 Inhibitor Responsiveness in Breast Cancer,"CDK4 inhibitors (CDK4/6i), such as palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib, are approved in combination with hormonal therapy as a front-line treatment for metastatic HR+, HER2- breast cancer. Their targets, CDK4 and CDK6, are cell-cycle regulatory proteins governing the G1–S phase transition across many tissue types. A key challenge remains to uncover biomarkers to identify those patients that may benefit from this class of drugs. Although CDK4/6i addition to estrogen modulation therapy essentially doubles the median progression-free survival, overall survival is not significantly increased. However, in reality only a subset of treated patients respond. Many patients exhibit primary resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition and do not derive any benefit from these agents, often switching to chemotherapy within 6 months. Some patients initially benefit from treatment, but later develop secondary resistance. This highlights the need for complementary or companion diagnostics to pinpoint patients who would respond. In addition, because CDK4 is a bona fide target in other tumor types where CDK4/6i therapy is currently in clinical trials, the lack of target identification may obscure benefit to a subset of patients there as well. This review summarizes the current status of CDK4/6i biomarker test development, both in clinical trials and at the bench, with particular attention paid to those which have a strong biological basis as well as supportive clinical data."
2014,Multi-level gene/MiRNA feature selection using deep belief nets and active learning,"Selecting the most discriminative genes/miRNAs has been raised as an important task in bioinformatics to enhance disease classifiers and to mitigate the dimensionality curse problem. Original feature selection methods choose genes/miRNAs based on their individual features regardless of how they perform together. Considering group features instead of individual ones provides a better view for selecting the most informative genes/miRNAs. Recently, deep learning has proven its ability in representing the data in multiple levels of abstraction, allowing for better discrimination between different classes. However, the idea of using deep learning for feature selection is not widely used in the bioinformatics field yet. In this paper, a novel multi-level feature selection approach named MLFS is proposed for selecting genes/miRNAs based on expression profiles. The approach is based on both deep and active learning. Moreover, an extension to use the technique for miRNAs is presented by considering the biological relation between miRNAs and genes. Experimental results show that the approach was able to outperform classical feature selection methods in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 9%, lung cancer by 6% and breast cancer by around 10% in F1-measure. Results also show the enhancement in F1-measure of our approach over recently related work in [1] and [2]."
2019,Profiling of Exosomal Biomarkers for Accurate Cancer Identification: Combining DNA-PAINT with Machine- Learning-Based Classification.,"Exosomes are endosome-derived vesicles enriched in body fluids such as urine, blood, and saliva. So far, they have been recognized as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnostics. However, the present single-variate analysis of exosomes has greatly limited the accuracy and specificity of diagnoses. Besides, most diagnostic approaches focus on bulk analysis using lots of exosomes and tend to be less accurate because they are vulnerable to impure extraction and concentration differences of exosomes. To address these challenges, a quantitative analysis platform is developed to implement a sequential quantification analysis of multiple exosomal surface biomarkers at the single-exosome level, which utilizes DNA-PAINT and a machine learning algorithm to automatically analyze the results. As a proof of concept, the profiling of four exosomal surface biomarkers (HER2, GPC-1, EpCAM, EGFR) is developed to identify exosomes from cancer-derived blood samples. Then, this technique is further applied to detect pancreatic cancer and breast cancer from unknown samples with 100% accuracy."
2014,The emerging roles of GPRC5A in diseases,"The ‘Retinoic Acid-Inducible G-protein-coupled receptors’ or RAIG are a group comprising the four orphan receptors GPRC5A, GPRC5B, GPRC5C and GPRC5D. As the name implies, their expression is induced by retinoic acid but beyond that very little is known about their function. In recent years, one member, GPRC5A, has been receiving increasing attention as it was shown to play important roles in human cancers. As a matter of fact, dysregulation of GPRC5A has been associated with several cancers including lung cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and pancreatic cancer. Here we review the current state of knowledge about the heterogeneity and evolution of GPRC5A, its regulation, its molecular functions, and its involvement in human disease."
2014,BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS V IADATA M INING : PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF SEVEN DIFFERENT ALGORITHMS,"According to World HealthOrganization (WHO), breast cancer is the top cancer in women both in the developed and the developing world. Increased life expectancy, urbanization and adoption of western lifestyles trigger the occurrence of breast cancer in the developing world. Most ca ncer events are diagnosed in the late phases of the illness and so, early detection in order to improve breast cancer outcome and survival is very crucial. In this study, it is intended to contribute to the early diagnosis of breast cancer. An analysis onbreast cancer diagnoses for the patients is given. For the purpose, first of all, data about the patients whose cancers’ have already been diagnosed is gathered and they are arranged, and then whether the other patients are in trouble with breast cancer ito be predicted under cover of those data. Predictions of the other patients are realized through seven different algorithms and the accuracies of those have been given. The data about the patients have been taken from UCI Machine Learning Reposito ry thanks to Dr. William H. Wolberg from the University of Wisconsin Hospitals, Madison. During the prediction process, RapidMiner 5.0 data mining tool is used to apply data mining with the desired algorithms."
2021,Systematic Review of Computing Approaches for Breast Cancer Detection Based Computer Aided Diagnosis Using Mammogram Images,"ABSTRACT Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer that plagues females. Mortality from breast cancer could be reduced by diagnosing and identifying it at an early stage. To detect breast cancer, various imaging modalities can be used, such as mammography. Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) systems can assist an expert radiologist to diagnose breast cancer at an early stage. This paper introduces the findings of a systematic review that seeks to examine the state-of-the-art CAD systems for breast cancer detection. This review is based on 118 publications published in 2018–2021 and retrieved from major scientific publication databases while using a rigorous methodology of a systematic review. We provide a general description and analysis of existing CAD systems that use machine learning methods as well as their current state based on mammogram image modalities and classification methods. This systematic review presents all stages of CAD including pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, feature selection, and classification. We identify research gaps and outline recommendations for future research. This systematic review may be helpful for both clinicians, who use CAD systems for early diagnosis of breast cancer, as well as for researchers to find knowledge gaps and create more contributions for breast cancer diagnostics."
2020,Artificial Neural Network Based Breast Cancer Screening: A Comprehensive Review,"Breast cancer is a common fatal disease for women. Early diagnosis and detection is necessary in order to improve the prognosis of breast cancer affected people. For predicting breast cancer, several automated systems are already developed using different medical imaging modalities. This paper provides a systematic review of the literature on artificial neural network (ANN) based models for the diagnosis of breast cancer via mammography. The advantages and limitations of different ANN models including spiking neural network (SNN), deep belief network (DBN), convolutional neural network (CNN), multilayer neural network (MLNN), stacked autoencoders (SAE), and stacked de-noising autoencoders (SDAE) are described in this review. The review also shows that the studies related to breast cancer detection applied different deep learning models to a number of publicly available datasets. For comparing the performance of the models, different metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, etc. were used in the existing studies. It is found that the best performance was achieved by residual neural network (ResNet)-50 and ResNet-101 models of CNN algorithm."
2018,"Surgery 3.0, artificial intelligence and the next‐generation surgeon","In December 2017, the Google subsidiary DeepMind announced that its AlphaZero artificial intelligence (AI) program had taught itself to play chess, from scratch, in just 4 h. This algorithmic program has since mastered moves and strategies entirely through self-play, and defeated the world champion chess program by an inventive approach to the ancient art of chess1. The wave of enthusiasm following this announcement has been felt well beyond gaming and genuine questions are now emerging regarding the potential for AI in other fields, including healthcare. This is especially relevant in disciplines with a strong emphasis on pattern recognition, notably medical imaging and histopathology, where AI-based platforms are equalling, and in some cases surpassing, their human counterparts. For example, computer scientists from Cornell University recently reported superior accuracy of classification in the detection of lymph node metastases in breast cancer using a deep learning algorithm, compared with conventional pathology2. In contrast, AI technology has taken longer to permeate through to the world of surgery, partly owing to the complex nature of interaction with human tissue at the core of the specialty, but also because of a perceived lack of necessity, evidence and awareness of the potential capabilities of computational approaches in surgical practice. AI is, however, advancing rapidly, and at a pace that is difficult to ignore. The current vision is one of augmented surgical practice to complement rather than replace human skills, particularly in two broad areas: surgical decision-making and operative surgery. Surgery involves complex decisions including, for example, choices about the need for multimodal therapy, timing of surgery, and radical versus organ-preserving surgery. Moreover, the surgeon is increasingly expected to provide patients with personalized data on potential risks, and likelihood of major morbidity and mortality. These complex assessments are beyond the capabilities of most surgeons. The development of tools such as algorithmic clinical decision support (CDS) within surgery, with access to large and varied stores of ‘big data’, underpinned by the use of integration of multiparametric data, allows crosstalk between data stores and computer"
2016,Predicting breast cancer recurrence using effective classification and feature selection technique,"Breast cancer is a major threat for middle aged women throughout the world and currently this is the second most threatening cause of cancer death in women. But early detection and prevention can significantly reduce the chances of death. An important fact regarding breast cancer prognosis is to optimize the probability of cancer recurrence. This paper aims at finding breast cancer recurrence probability using different data mining techniques. We also provide a noble approach in order to improve the accuracy of those models. Cancer patient's data were collected from Wisconsin dataset of UCI machine learning Repository. This dataset contained total 35 attributes in which we applied Naive Bayes, C4.5 Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification algorithms and calculated their prediction accuracy. An efficient feature selection algorithm helped us to improve the accuracy of each model by reducing some lower ranked attributes. Not only the contributions of these attributes are very less, but their addition also misguides the classification algorithms. After a careful selection of upper ranked attributes we found a much improved accuracy rate for all three algorithms."
2014,The effect of a supportive educational program based on COPE model on caring burden and quality of life in family caregivers of women with breast cancer,"Background: The family caregivers of the people with cancer such as breast cancer experience a decrease in their quality of life and an increase of their caring burden. In most of the cases, the researchers consider the quality of life and physical and psychological problems in patients with cancer and pay less attention to the family caregivers. To reduce the caring burden imposed to the caregivers and improve their quality of life, supportive strategies such as problem solving can be used. These interventions may have benefits for the caregivers although the research results are contradictory. The aim of this research was to determine the effect of a supportive educational program, based on COPE model, which focuses on creativity, optimism, planning, and expert information on individuals, on the caring burden and quality of life in the family caregivers of women with breast cancer. Materials and Methods: The present study is a clinical trial, which was conducted in Seyed-Al-Shohada Hospital of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and a private center of chemotherapy in 2012. In this study, researchers investigated the effect of a supportive educational program based on COPE model on the caring burden and quality of life in the family caregivers of women with breast cancer. This supportive educational program included two hospital visits and two telephone sessions based on COPE model for 9 days. A total of 64 patients were selected based on the inclusion criteria and randomly assigned into two groups. Data were collected by use of Caregiver Quality of Life Index-Cancer (CQOL-C), World Health Organization Quality of Life — Bref(WHOQOL-Bref)_, and Zarit caring burden at the beginning of the intervention and a month after the intervention. Results: The results showed that in the experimental group, the mean score of physical, mental, spiritual, environmental domains and overall quality of life in the family caregivers was significantly increased compared to the control group, but there was no change in the social domain of quality of life in the two groups. In the experimental group, the mean score of caring burden among the caregivers was significantly decreased compared to the control group. Conclusion: Results of the present study suggested that a supportive educational program can improve physical, mental, spiritual, environmental domains and overall quality of life. It can also decrease the caring burden in the family caregivers of women with breast cancer. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact of these interventions on quality of life and caring burden in the family caregivers of women with breast cancer undergoing other cancer treatments."
2019,A Deep Learning Approach for Breast Invasive Ductal Carcinoma Detection and Lymphoma Multi-Classification in Histological Images,"Accurately identifying and categorizing cancer structures/sub-types in histological images is an important clinical task involving a considerable workload and a specific subspecialty of pathologists. Digitizing pathology is a current trend that provides large amounts of visual data allowing a faster and more precise diagnosis through the development of automatic image analysis techniques. Recent studies have shown promising results for the automatic analysis of cancer tissue by using deep learning strategies that automatically extract and organize the discriminative information from the data. This paper explores deep learning methods for the automatic analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin stained histological images of breast cancer and lymphoma. In particular, a deep learning approach is proposed for two different use cases: the detection of invasive ductal carcinoma in breast histological images and the classification of lymphoma sub-types. Both use cases have been addressed by adopting a residual convolutional neural network that is part of a convolutional autoencoder network (i.e., FusionNet). The performances have been evaluated on the public datasets of digital histological images and have been compared with those obtained by using different deep neural networks (UNet and ResNet). Additionally, comparisons with the state of the art have been considered, in accordance with different deep learning approaches. The experimental results show an improvement of 5.06% in F-measure score for the detection task and an improvement of 1.09% in the accuracy measure for the classification task."
2022,A Deep Learning Method for Breast Cancer Classification in the Pathology Images,"Objective: Breast cancer is the most common female cancer in the world, and it poses a huge threat to women's health. There is currently promising research concerning its early diagnosis using deep learning methodologies. However, some commonly used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and their variations, such as AlexNet, VGGNet, GoogleNet and so on, are prone to overfitting in breast cancer classification, due to both small-scale breast pathology image datasets and overconfident softmax-cross-entropy loss. To alleviate the overfitting issue for better classification accuracy, we propose a novel framework for breast pathology classification, called the AlexNet-BC model. The model is pre-trained using the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned using an augmented dataset. We also devise an improved cross-entropy loss function to penalize overconfident low-entropy output distributions and make the predictions suitable for uniform distributions. The proposed approach is then validated through a series of comparative experiments on BreaKHis, IDC and UCSB datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods at different magnifications. Its strong robustness and generalization capabilities make it suitable for histopathology clinical computer-aided diagnosis systems."
2020,Deep-Learning–Based Characterization of Tumor-Infiltrating Lymphocytes in Breast Cancers From Histopathology Images and Multiomics Data,"PURPOSE Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and their spatial characterizations on whole-slide images (WSIs) of histopathology sections have become crucial in diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response prediction for different cancers. However, fully automatic assessment of TILs on WSIs currently remains a great challenge because of the heterogeneity and large size of WSIs. We present an automatic pipeline based on a cascade-training U-net to generate high-resolution TIL maps on WSIs. METHODS We present global cell-level TIL maps and 43 quantitative TIL spatial image features for 1,000 WSIs of The Cancer Genome Atlas patients with breast cancer. For more specific analysis, all the patients were divided into three subtypes, namely, estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, ER-negative, and triple-negative groups. The associations between TIL scores and gene expression and somatic mutation were examined separately in three breast cancer subtypes. Both univariate and multivariate survival analyses were performed on 43 TIL image features to examine the prognostic value of TIL spatial patterns in different breast cancer subtypes. RESULTS The TIL score was in strong association with immune response pathway and genes (eg, programmed death-1 and CLTA4). Different breast cancer subtypes showed TIL score in association with mutations from different genes suggesting that different genetic alterations may lead to similar phenotypes. Spatial TIL features that represent density and distribution of TIL clusters were important indicators of the patient outcomes. CONCLUSION Our pipeline can facilitate computational pathology-based discovery in cancer immunology and research on immunotherapy. Our analysis results are available for the research community to generate new hypotheses and insights on breast cancer immunology and development."
2019,Learning Where to See: A Novel Attention Model for Automated Immunohistochemical Scoring,"Estimating over-amplification of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) on invasive breast cancer is regarded as a significant predictive and prognostic marker. We propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based model that treats immunohistochemical (IHC) scoring of HER2 as a sequential learning task. For a given image tile sampled from multi-resolution giga-pixel whole slide image (WSI), the model learns to sequentially identify some of the diagnostically relevant regions of interest (ROIs) by following a parameterized policy. The selected ROIs are processed by recurrent and residual convolution networks to learn the discriminative features for different HER2 scores and predict the next location, without requiring to process all the sub-image patches of a given tile for predicting the HER2 score, mimicking the histopathologist who would not usually analyze every part of the slide at the highest magnification. The proposed model incorporates a task-specific regularization term and inhibition of return mechanism to prevent the model from revisiting the previously attended locations. We evaluated our model on two IHC datasets: a publicly available dataset from the HER2 scoring challenge contest and another dataset consisting of WSIs of gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine tumor sections stained with Glo1 marker. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms other methods based on state-of-the-art deep convolutional networks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using DRL for IHC scoring and could potentially lead to wider use of DRL in the domain of computational pathology reducing the computational burden of the analysis of large multi-gigapixel histology images."
2018,Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Cancer is the second cause of death in the world. 8.8 million patients died due to cancer in 2015. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women. Several types of research have been done on early detection of breast cancer to start treatment and increase the chance of survival. Most of the studies concentrated on mammogram images. However, mammogram images sometimes have a risk of false detection that may endanger the patient’s health. It is vital to find alternative methods which are easier to implement and work with different data sets, cheaper and safer, that can produce a more reliable prediction. This paper proposes a hybrid model combined of several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) for effective breast cancer detection. This study also discusses the datasets used for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The proposed model can be used with different data types such as image, blood, etc."
2019,Convolutional neural network for cell classification using microscope images of intracellular actin networks,"Automated cell classification is an important yet a challenging computer vision task with significant benefits to biomedicine. In recent years, there have been several studies attempted to build an artificial intelligence-based cell classifier using label-free cellular images obtained from an optical microscope. Although these studies showed promising results, such classifiers were not able to reflect the biological diversity of different types of cell. While in terms of malignant cell, it is well-known that intracellular actin filaments are altered substantially. This is thought to be closely related to the abnormal growth features of tumor cells, their ability to invade surrounding tissues and also to metastasize. Therefore, being able to classify different types of cell based on their biological behaviors using automated technique is more advantageous. This article reveals the difference in the actin cytoskeleton structures between breast normal and cancer cells, which may provide new information regarding malignant changes and be used as additional diagnostic marker. Since the features cannot be well detected by human eyes, we proposed the application of convolutional neural network (CNN) in cell classification based on actin-labeled fluorescence microscopy images. The CNN was evaluated on a large number of actin-labeled fluorescence microscopy images of one human normal breast epithelial cell line and two types of human breast cancer cell line with different levels of aggressiveness. The study revealed that the CNN performed better in the cell classification task compared to a human expert."
2015,Combined Surgical Treatment in Breast Cancer-Related Lymphedema,"Abstract Background Lymphedema is a well-known sequela of breast but no consensus has been reached about the ideal treatment. Surgical approaches, however, are receiving increased attention. Various microsurgical reconstructive techniques aim to restore anatomy and function of the lymphatic system in upper limb breast cancer-related lymphedema (BCRL). We combined two techniques, lymphaticovenous anastomosis (LVA) and autologous lymph node transplantation (ALNT) after carefully selecting those who may benefit from the surgery. We called this the “combined surgical treatment (CST)” approach. Methods From June 2007 to December 2011, we performed CST in 106 patients with upper limb BCRL. Clinical evaluation and diagnostic imaging studies were performed preoperatively in all the patients. CST was offered to patients with stage I/II lymphedema, according to the criteria of the International Society of Lymphology (ISL). Results Overall 59 of the 106 patients underwent LVA, 7 underwent ALNT, and 40 underwent both the techniques. All 47 lymph node (LN)-flaps survived but 11 (22%) required surgical revision within 3 days. A total of 21 LN-flaps (45%) showed no radiotracer uptake at 1 year. Around 1 to 7 LVAs for each patient (average 3.4) were performed. Preoperative versus postoperative excess circumference decreased between 12 and 86.7% (average 39.72%). Arm circumference decreased between 0.9 and 6.1 cm (average 2.75 cm). The number of episodes of lymphangitis per year decreased from 1.8 to 0.2. Conclusion Preoperative assessment is essential to select patients who can benefit from surgery for lymphedema and to choose the best surgical approach in each case. Our satisfactory results in well-selected cases encourage further research into surgical treatment for BCRL."
2021,Conventional Machine Learning versus Deep Learning for Magnification Dependent Histopathological Breast Cancer Image Classification: A Comparative Study with Visual Explanation,"Breast cancer is a serious threat to women. Many machine learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods have been proposed for the early diagnosis of breast cancer based on histopathological images. Even though many such classification methods achieved high accuracy, many of them lack the explanation of the classification process. In this paper, we compare the performance of conventional machine learning (CML) against deep learning (DL)-based methods. We also provide a visual interpretation for the task of classifying breast cancer in histopathological images. For CML-based methods, we extract a set of handcrafted features using three feature extractors and fuse them to get image representation that would act as an input to train five classical classifiers. For DL-based methods, we adopt the transfer learning approach to the well-known VGG-19 deep learning architecture, where its pre-trained version on the large scale ImageNet, is block-wise fine-tuned on histopathological images. The evaluation of the proposed methods is carried out on the publicly available BreaKHis dataset for the magnification dependent classification of benign and malignant breast cancer and their eight sub-classes, and a further validation on KIMIA Path960, a magnification-free histopathological dataset with 20 image classes, is also performed. After providing the classification results of CML and DL methods, and to better explain the difference in the classification performance, we visualize the learned features. For the DL-based method, we intuitively visualize the areas of interest of the best fine-tuned deep neural networks using attention maps to explain the decision-making process and improve the clinical interpretability of the proposed models. The visual explanation can inherently improve the pathologist’s trust in automated DL methods as a credible and trustworthy support tool for breast cancer diagnosis. The achieved results show that DL methods outperform CML approaches where we reached an accuracy between 94.05% and 98.13% for the binary classification and between 76.77% and 88.95% for the eight-class classification, while for DL approaches, the accuracies range from 85.65% to 89.32% for the binary classification and from 63.55% to 69.69% for the eight-class classification."
2014,"Primary care physician characteristics associated with cancer screening: a retrospective cohort study in Ontario, Canada","Primary care physicians can serve as both facilitators and barriers to cancer screening, particularly for under‐screened groups such as immigrant patients. The objective of this study was to inform physician‐targeted interventions by identifying primary care physician characteristics associated with cancer screening for their eligible patients, for their eligible immigrant patients, and for foreign‐trained physicians, for their eligible immigrant patients from the same world region. A population‐based retrospective cohort study was performed, looking back 3 years from 31 December 2010. The study was performed in urban primary care practices in Ontario, Canada's largest province. A total of 6303 physicians serving 1,156,627 women eligible for breast cancer screening, 2,730,380 women eligible for cervical screening, and 2,260,569 patients eligible for colorectal screening participated. Appropriate breast screening was defined as at least one mammogram in the previous 2 years, appropriate cervical screening was defined as at least one Pap test in the previous 3 years, and appropriate colorectal screening as at least one fecal occult blood test in the previous 2 years or at least one colonoscopy or barium enema in the previous 10 years. Just fewer than 40% of physicians were female, and 26.1% were foreign trained. In multivariable analyses, physicians who attended medical schools in the Caribbean/Latin America, the Middle East/North Africa, South Asia, and Western Europe were less likely to screen their patients than Canadian graduates. South Asian‐trained physicians were significantly less likely to screen South Asian women for cervical cancer than other foreign‐trained physicians who were seeing region‐congruent patients (adjusted odds ratio: 0.56 [95% confidence interval 0.32–0.98] versus physicians from the USA, Australia and New Zealand). South Asian patients were the most vulnerable to under‐screening, and decreasing patient income quintile was consistently associated with lower likelihood of screening, although less so for immigrant patients. This study highlights certain physician characteristics that are associated with cancer screening for eligible patients, including immigrant patients, and that should be considered when designing physician‐targeted interventions. We have also highlighted an ethnic community, South Asians, which requires particular attention, both among its patients and its primary care providers. Future research should further explore the reasons for these findings."
2016,High-Content Analysis of Breast Cancer Using Single-Cell Deep Transfer Learning,"High-content analysis has revolutionized cancer drug discovery by identifying substances that alter the phenotype of a cell, which prevents tumor growth and metastasis. The high-resolution biofluorescence images from assays allow precise quantitative measures enabling the distinction of small molecules of a host cell from a tumor. In this work, we are particularly interested in the application of deep neural networks (DNNs), a cutting-edge machine learning method, to the classification of compounds in chemical mechanisms of action (MOAs). Compound classification has been performed using image-based profiling methods sometimes combined with feature reduction methods such as principal component analysis or factor analysis. In this article, we map the input features of each cell to a particular MOA class without using any treatment-level profiles or feature reduction methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of DNN in this domain, leveraging single-cell information. Furthermore, we use deep transfer learning (DTL) to alleviate the intensive and computational demanding effort of searching the huge parameter’s space of a DNN. Results show that using this approach, we obtain a 30% speedup and a 2% accuracy improvement."
2019,Machine Learning-Based Analysis of MR Multiparametric Radiomics for the Subtype Classification of Breast Cancer,"Objective: To investigate whether machine learning analysis of multiparametric MR radiomics can help classify immunohistochemical (IHC) subtypes of breast cancer. Study design: One hundred and thirty-four consecutive patients with pathologically-proven invasive ductal carcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. A total of 2,498 features were extracted from the DCE and DWI images, together with the new calculated images, including DCE images changing over six time points (DCEsequential) and DWI images changing over three b-values (DWIsequential). We proposed a novel two-stage feature selection method combining traditional statistics and machine learning-based methods. The accuracies of the 4-IHC classification and triple negative (TN) vs. non-TN cancers were assessed. Results: For the 4-IHC classification task, the best accuracy of 72.4% was achieved based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) or subspace discrimination of assembled learning in conjunction with 20 selected features, and only small dependent emphasis of Kendall-tau-b for sequential features, based on the DWIsequential with the LDA model, yielding an accuracy of 53.7%. The linear support vector machine (SVM) and medium k-nearest neighbor using eight features yielded the highest accuracy of 91.0% for comparing TN to non-TN cancers, and the maximum variance for DWIsequential alone, together with a linear SVM model, achieved an accuracy of 83.6%. Conclusions: Whole-tumor radiomics on MR multiparametric images, DCE images changing over time points, and DWI images changing over different b-values provide a non-invasive analytical approach for breast cancer subtype classification and TN cancer identification."
2016,Gelatin Methacrylate Hydrogels as Biomimetic Three-Dimensional Matrixes for Modeling Breast Cancer Invasion and Chemoresponse in Vitro.,"Recent studies have shown that three-dimensional (3D) culture environments allow the study of cellular responses in a setting that more closely resembles the in vivo milieu. In this context, hydrogels have become popular scaffold options for the 3D cell culture. Because the mechanical and biochemical properties of culture matrixes influence crucial cell behavior, selecting a suitable matrix for replicating in vivo cellular phenotype in vitro is essential for understanding disease progression. Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) hydrogels have been the focus of much attention because of their inherent bioactivity, favorable hydration and diffusion properties, and ease-of-tailoring of their physicochemical characteristics. Therefore, in this study we examined the efficacy of GelMA hydrogels as a suitable platform to model specific attributes of breast cancer. We observed increased invasiveness in vitro and increased tumorigenic ability in vivo in breast cancer cells cultured on GelMA hydrogels. Further, cells cultured on GelMA matrixes were more resistant to paclitaxel treatment, as shown by the results of cell-cycle analysis and gene expression. This study, therefore, validates GelMA hydrogels as inexpensive, cell-responsive 3D platforms for modeling key characteristics associated with breast cancer metastasis, in vitro."
2015,Post-traumatic stress disorder and post-traumatic growth in breast cancer patients--a systematic review.,"Breast cancer (BC) is potentially a traumatic stressor which may be associated with negative outcomes, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or positive changes, such as post-traumatic growth (PTG). This study aims to identify the core issues of BC related PTSD, PTG and psychological distress by interrogating the literature in BC survivors. We have also highlighted issues related to the assessment, diagnosis and clinical management of PTSD and PTG. The authors systematically reviewed studies published from 1985 to 2014 pertaining to PTSD, psychological distress and PTG in BC survivors with particular attention paid to incidence rates and causative factors. Multiple studies intimated that women with BC have evidence of PTSD at the initial stages of diagnosis, whereas PTG develops once patients undergo treatment. Early diagnosis and treatment of PTSD/PTG is paramount from literature review but the previously mentioned relationship between PTSD and PTG in BC patients could not be verified. It is evident from the literature that a small percentage of BC patients experience PTSD, while the majority experience PTG after BC diagnosis and treatment. Future research should include prospective studies focusing on high-risk patients, causative factors and the development of psychological interventions."
2015,Advanced Age Is a Predictor of 30-Day Complications after Autologous but Not Implant-Based Postmastectomy Breast Reconstruction,"Background: Older breast cancer patients undergo postmastectomy breast reconstruction infrequently, in part because of a perception of increased surgical risk. This study sought to investigate the effects of age on perioperative complications after postmastectomy breast reconstruction. Methods: The American College of Surgeons National Surgery Quality Improvement Program Participant Use Files from 2005 to 2012 were used to identify women with breast cancer who underwent unilateral mastectomy alone or with immediate reconstruction. Thirty-day complication rates were compared between younger (<65 years) and older (≥65 years) women after implant-based reconstruction, autologous reconstruction, or mastectomy alone. Linear and logistic regression models were used to control for differences in comorbidities and age. Results: A total of 40,769 patients were studied, of whom 15,093 (37 percent) were aged 65 years or older. Breast reconstruction was performed in 39.5 percent of younger and 10.7 percent of older women. The attributable risks of breast reconstruction, manifested by longer hospital stays (p < 0.001), more frequent complications (p < 0.001), and more reoperations (p < 0.001), were similar in older and younger women. There were no differences in the adjusted complication rates between older and younger patients undergoing implant-based reconstruction. However, older women undergoing autologous reconstruction were more likely to suffer venous thromboembolism (OR, 3.67; p = 0.02). Conclusions: The perioperative risks attributable to breast reconstruction are similar in older and younger women. Older patients should be counseled that their age does not confer an increased risk of complications after implant-based breast reconstruction. However, age is an independent risk factor for venous thromboembolism after autologous reconstruction. Special attention should be paid to venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in this group. CLINICAL QUESTION/LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Risk, II."
2019,RNA‐binding protein NONO promotes breast cancer proliferation by post‐transcriptional regulation of SKP2 and E2F8,"The majority of breast cancers are primarily hormone‐sensitive and can be managed by endocrine therapy, although therapy‐resistant or hormone‐refractory cancers need alternative treatments. Recently, increasing attention is being paid to RNA‐binding proteins (RBP) in cancer pathophysiology. The precise role of RBP in breast cancer, however, remains to be clarified. We herein show that an RBP non‐POU domain‐containing octamer binding (NONO) plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of breast cancers regardless of their hormone dependency. Clinicopathological and immunohistochemical study of 127 breast cancer cases showed that NONO is a significant independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients. Notably, siRNA‐mediated NONO knockdown substantially repressed the proliferation of both hormone‐sensitive MCF‐7 and hormone‐refractory MB‐MDA‐231 breast cancer cells. Integrative analysis combined with expression microarray and RIP‐sequencing (RNA immunoprecipitation‐sequencing) showed that NONO post‐transcriptionally regulates the expression of cell proliferation‐related genes by binding to their mRNAs, as exemplified by S‐phase‐associated kinase 2 and E2F transcription factor 8. Overall, these results suggest that NONO is a key regulator for breast cancer proliferation through the pre‐mRNA splicing of cell proliferation‐related genes and could be a potential new diagnostic and therapeutic target for advanced disease."
2020,New Machine Learning Applications to Accelerate Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer: Rise of the Support Vector Machines.,"Artificial intelligence, machine learning, health care robots, and algorithms for clinical decision-making are currently being sought after in diverse fields of clinical medicine and bioengineering. The field of personalized medicine stands to benefit from new technologies so as to harness the omics big data, for example, to individualize and accelerate cancer diagnostics and therapeutics in particular. In this overarching context, breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies worldwide with multiple underlying molecular etiologies and each subtype displaying diverse clinical outcomes. Disease stratification for breast cancer is, therefore, vital to its effective and individualized clinical care. The support vector machine (SVM) is a rising machine learning approach that offers robust classification of high-dimensional big data into small numbers of data points (support vectors), achieving differentiation of subgroups in a short amount of time. Considering the rapid timelines required for both diagnosis and treatment of most aggressive cancers, this new machine learning technique has important clinical and public applications and implications for high-throughput data analysis and contextualization. This expert review describes and examines, first, the SVM models employed to forecast breast cancer subtypes using diverse systems science data, including transcriptomics, epigenetics, proteomics, and radiomics, as well as biological pathway, clinical, pathological, and biochemical data. Then, we compare the performance of the present SVM and other diagnostic and therapeutic prediction models across the data types. We conclude by emphasizing that data integration is a critical bottleneck in systems science, cancer research and development, and health care innovation and that SVM and machine learning approaches offer new solutions and ways forward in biomedical, bioengineering, and clinical applications."
2016,Berberine reverses lapatinib resistance of HER2-positive breast cancer cells by increasing the level of ROS,"ABSTRACT Lapatinib, a novel tyrosine kinase inhibitor of HER2/EGFR, is used to treat HER2-positive breast cancer. However, acquired drug resistance has limited the clinical therapeutic efficacy of lapatinib. Our previous study found that inhibition of autophagy can reduce the proliferation, DNA synthesis, and colony-forming capacity of lapatinib-resistant cells. Berberine has attracted extensive attention due to its wide range of biochemical and pharmacological effects in breast cancer treatment. It has been reported that berberine can induce oxidative stress and the mitochondrial-related apoptotic pathway in human breast cancer cells. In our current study, we found that a new combination therapy of berberine with lapatinib overcame lapatinib resistance. Furthermore, we found that berberine induced apoptosis of lapatinib-resistant cells through upregulating the level of ROS. Specially, lapatinib activated both the c-Myc/pro-Nrf2 pathway and GSK-3β signaling to stabilize Nrf2 and maintain a low level of ROS in resistant cells. However, berberine can upset the ROS balance by downregulating c-Myc to reverse the lapatinib resistance. Our finding provides a novel strategy of using berberine to overcome lapatinib resistance."
2021,High Throughput Blood Analysis Based on Deep Learning Algorithm and Self‐Positioning Super‐Hydrophobic SERS Platform for Non‐Invasive Multi‐Disease Screening,"Blood analysis is crucial for early cancer screening and improving patient survival rates. However, developing an effective strategy for early cancer detection using high‐throughput blood analysis is still challenging. Herein, a novel automatic super‐hydrophobic platform is developed together with a deep learning (DL)‐based label‐free serum and surface‐enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), along with an automatic high‐throughput Raman spectrometer to build an effective point‐of‐care diagnosis system. A total of 695 high‐quality serum SERS spectra are obtained from 203 healthy volunteers, 77 leukemia M5, 94 hepatitis B virus, and 321 breast cancer patients. Serum SERS signals from the normal (n = 183) and patient (n = 443) groups are used to assess the DL model, which classify them with a maximum accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, when SERS is combined with DL, it exhibits excellent diagnostic accuracy (98.6%) for the external held‐out test set, indicating that this method can be used to develop a high throughput, rapid, and label‐free tool for screening diseases."
2015,Prognostic role of PIK3CA mutations of cell‐free DNA in early‐stage triple negative breast cancer,"PIK3CA is an oncogene that encodes the p110α component of phosphatidylinositol 3‐kinase (PI3K); it is the second most frequently mutated gene following the TP53 gene. In the clinical setting, PIK3CA mutations may have favorable prognostic value for hormone receptor‐positive breast cancer patients and, during the past few years, PIK3CA mutations of cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) have attracted attention as a potential noninvasive biomarker of cancer. However, there are few reports on the clinical implications of PIK3CA mutations for TNBC patients. We investigated the PIK3CA major mutation status of cfDNA as a noninvasive biomarker of cancer using droplet digital polymerase chain reaction (ddPCR), which has high level sensitivity and specificity for cancer mutation, in early‐stage 49 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients. A total of 12 (24.4%) of 49 patients had PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA. In a median follow up of 54.4 months, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant impacts on relapse‐free survival (RFS; P = 0.0072) and breast cancer‐specific survival (BCSS; P = 0.016), according to the log‐lank test. In a Cox proportional hazards model, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA had significant prognostic value in the univariate and multivariate analysis. Additionally, the presence of PIK3CA mutations of cfDNA was significantly correlated with positive androgen receptor phosphorylated form depending on PI3K signaling pathway (pAR) which is independent favorable prognostic factors of TNBC. We demonstrated that the presence of PIK3CA major mutations of cfDNA could be a discriminatory predictor of RFS and BCSS in early‐stage TNBC patients and it was associated with PI3K pathway‐dependent AR phosphorylation."
2021,Review of Breast Cancer Pathologigcal Image Processing,"Breast cancer is one of the most common malignancies. Pathological image processing of breast has become an important means for early diagnosis of breast cancer. Using medical image processing to assist doctors to detect potential breast cancer as early as possible has always been a hot topic in the field of medical image diagnosis. In this paper, a breast cancer recognition method based on image processing is systematically expounded from four aspects: breast cancer detection, image segmentation, image registration, and image fusion. The achievements and application scope of supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep learning, CNN, and so on in breast cancer examination are expounded. The prospect of unsupervised learning and transfer learning for breast cancer diagnosis is prospected. Finally, the privacy protection of breast cancer patients is put forward."
2020,Multi-Dimensional Organic Mass Cytometry: Simultaneous Analysis of Proteins and Metabolites on Single Cells.,"Mass cytometry is attracting significant attention for its spatiotemporal high-throughput single-cell analysis. As the first demonstration of simultaneous detection of single-cell proteins and untargeted metabolites, a multi-dimensional organic mass cytometry system was established by a simple microfluidic chip connected to a nanoelectrospray mass spectrometer, providing useful cell heterogeneous information. A series of mass probes with online-dissociated mass tags were developed, ensuring the semi-quantification of cell surface proteins and compatibility of endogenous metabolite detection at single-cell level. Six cell surface antigens and ~100 metabolites from three ovarian cancer cell types and two breast cancer cell types were successfully monitored, and contributed to highly sensitive and specific cell typing. Doxorubicin-resistant cancer cell analysis confirmed its applications in distinguishing rare cell phenotypes. As a new generation of mass cytometry, the proposed system is simple, extensible, and promising for cell typing, drug-resistance analysis of tumor cells, and clinical diagnosis and therapy at single-cell level."
2019,A Decade of Internet of Things: Analysis in the Light of Healthcare Applications,"Impressive growth in the number of wearable health monitoring devices has affected global health industry as they provide rapid and intricate details related to physical examinations, such as discomfort, heart rate, and blood glucose level, which enable doctors to efficiently diagnose sensitive heart troubles. The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is a phenomenon wherein computer networks and medical equipment are connected through the Internet to provide real-time interaction between physicians and patients. In this article, we present a comprehensive view of the IoMT and its related Machine Learning (ML)-based developed frameworks designed, or being utilized, in the last decade, i.e., from 2010 to 2019. The presented techniques are designed for monitoring limbs, controlling rural healthcare, identifying e-health applications, monitoring health through mobile apps, classifying heart sounds, detecting stress in drivers, monitoring cardiac diseases, making the decision to predict heart attacks, recognizing human activities, and classifying breast cancer. The aim is to provide a clear picture of the existing IoMT environment so that the analysis may pave the way for the diagnosis of critical disorders such as cancer, heart attack, and blood pressure among others. In the end, we also provide some unresolved challenges that are confronted in the deployment of the secure IoMT-based healthcare systems."
2019,Transfer Learning in Breast Mammogram Abnormalities Classification With Mobilenet and Nasnet,"Breast cancer has an important incidence in women mortality worldwide. Currently, mammography is considered the gold standard for breast abnormalities screening examinations since it aids in the early detection and diagnosis of the illness. However, both identification of mass lesions and its malignancy classification is a challenging problem for artificial intelligence. Research has turned to the use of deep learning models in mammography which can enhance the performance of Computer Aided Diagnosis Systems (CADx). In this paper, we present our preliminary results on the use of transfer learning for malignancy classification of breast abnormality. We experiment with models that, according to our literature review, have not yet been explored thoroughly such as NasNet and MobileNet. Their performance is compared with InceptionV3 and Resnet50. The best results were obtained with Resnet50 and MobileNet with 78.4% and 74.3%, respectively. Also, some image pre-processing steps are studied in order to increase classification accuracy."
2020,Capturing Cellular Topology in Multi-Gigapixel Pathology Images,"In computational pathology, multi-gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are typically divided into small patches because of their extremely large size and memory requirements. However, following this strategy, one risks losing visual context which is very important in the development of machine learning models aimed at diagnostic and prognostic assessment of WSIs. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional neural network based model (called Slide Graph) which overcomes these limitations by building a graph representation of the cellular architecture in an entire WSI in a bottom-up manner. We evaluate Slide Graph for prediction of the status of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and progesterone receptor (PR) expression from WSIs of H&E stained tissue slides of breast cancer. We demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods and is more computationally efficient. The proposed paradigm of WSI-level graphs can potentially be applied to other problems in computational pathology as well."
2020,Breast Cancer Classification Using Deep Learning Approaches and Histopathology Image: A Comparison Study,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models are a type of deep learning architecture introduced to achieve the correct classification of breast cancer. This paper has a two-fold purpose. The first aim is to investigate the various deep learning models in classifying breast cancer histopathology images. This study identified the most accurate models in terms of the binary, four, and eight classifications of breast cancer histopathology image databases. The different accuracy scores obtained for the deep learning models on the same database showed that other factors such as pre-processing, data augmentation, and transfer learning methods can impact the ability of the models to achieve higher accuracy. The second purpose of our manuscript is to investigate the latest models that have no or limited examination done in previous studies. The models like ResNeXt, Dual Path Net, SENet, and NASNet had been identified with the most cutting-edge results for the ImageNet database. These models were examined for the binary, and eight classifications on BreakHis, a breast cancer histopathology image database. Furthermore, the BACH database was used to investigate these models for four classifications. Then, these models were compared with the previous studies to find and propose the most state-of-the-art models for each classification. Since the Inception-ResNet-V2 architecture achieved the best results for binary and eight classifications, we have examined this model in our study as well to provide a better comparison result. In short, this paper provides an extensive evaluation and discussion about the experimental settings for each study that had been conducted on the breast cancer histopathology images."
2017,Organic molecules with propeller structures for efficient photoacoustic imaging and photothermal ablation of cancer cells,"Photoacoustic (PA) imaging has recently attracted great attention due to its noninvasive and nonionizing properties and high penetration depth. This technique is particularly attractive for sentinel lymph node (SLN) imaging, which is highly desirable during sentinel lymph node biopsy for the detection of breast cancer metastasis. In this work, we report the design and synthesis of BTPETTQ with a propeller structure and a donor–acceptor–donor configuration, which exhibits strong NIR absorption, extremely weak fluorescence and a high PA signal in solution as molecular species. After being encapsulated into a polymeric matrix, BTPETTQ nanoparticles (NPs) also show excellent PA signal output, which is superior to the widely used gold nanorods based on the same mass and is also better than that from the NPs based on the core molecule of TTQ without tetraphenylethene modification. High-resolution PA imaging of SLN is achieved after injection of BTPETTQ NPs into the left paw of rats. The good photothermal conversion efficiency (40%) of BTPETTQ NPs also ensures their good performance in photothermal therapy, which is validated by the effective killing of HeLa cells upon 808 nm laser irradiation. This work demonstrates the great potential of compounds with propeller structures for PA imaging and photothermal therapy applications."
2020,A Systematic Review of Breast Cancer Detection Using Thermography and Neural Networks,"Breast cancer plays a significant role in affecting female mortality. Researchers are actively seeking to develop early detection methods of breast cancer. Several technologies contributed to the reduction in mortality rate from this disease, but early detection contributes most to preventing disease spread, breast amputation and death. Thermography is a promising technology for early diagnosis where thermal cameras employed are of high resolution and sensitivity. The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with thermal images is an effective tool to detect early stage breast cancer and is foreseen to provide impressive predictability levels. This paper reviews systematically the related works employing thermography with AI highlighting their contributions and drawbacks and proposing open issues for research. Several different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and deep learning models were used in the literature to process thermographic images of breast cancer, such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Probability Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ResNet50, SeResNet50, V Net, Bayes Net, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional and DeConvolutional Neural Networks (C-DCNN), VGG-16, Hybrid (ResNet-50 and V-Net), ResNet101, DenseNet and InceptionV3. Previous studies were found limited to varying the numbers of thermal images used mostly from DMR-IR database. In addition, analysis of the literature indicate that several factors do affect the performance of the Neural Network used, such as Database, optimization method, Network model and extracted features. However, due to small sample size used, most of the studies achieved a classification accuracy of 80% to 100%."
2017,Using Google Trends Data to Study Public Interest in Breast Cancer Screening in Brazil: Why Not a Pink February?,"Background One of the major challenges of the Brazilian Ministry of Health is to foster interest in breast cancer screening (BCS), especially among women at high risk. Strategies have been developed to promote the early identification of breast cancer mainly by Pink October campaigns. The massive number of queries conducted through Google creates traffic data that can be analyzed to show unrevealed interest cycles and their seasonalities. Objectives Using Google Trends, we studied cycles of public interest in queries toward mammography and breast cancer along the last 5 years. We hypothesize that these data may be correlated with collective interest cycles leveraged by national BCS campaigns such as Pink October. Methods Google Trends was employed to normalize traffic data on a scale from 0 (<1% of the peak volume) to 100 (peak of traffic) presented as weekly relative search volume (RSV) concerning mammography and breast cancer as search terms. A time series covered the last 261 weeks (November 2011 to October 2016), and RSV of both terms were compared with their respective annual means. Polynomial trendlines (second order) were employed to estimate overall trends. Results We found an upward trend for both terms over the 5 years, with almost parallel trendlines. Remarkable peaks were found along Pink October months— mammography and breast cancer searches were leveraged up reaching, respectively, 119.1% (2016) and 196.8% (2015) above annual means. Short downward RSVs along December-January months were also noteworthy along all the studied period. These trends traced an N-shaped pattern with higher peaks in Pink October months and sharp falls along subsequent December and January. Conclusions Considering these findings, it would be reasonable to bring Pink October to the beginning of each year, thereby extending the beneficial effect of the campaigns. It would be more appropriate to start screening campaigns at the beginning of the year, when new resolutions are taken and new projects are added to everyday routines. Our work raises attention to the study of traffic data to encourage health campaign analysts to undertake better analysis based on marketing practices."
2017,Computer-aided mammogram diagnosis system using deep learning convolutional fully complex-valued relaxation neural network classifier,"In this study, a novel deep learning-based framework for classifying the digital mammograms is introduced. The development of this methodology is based on deep learning strategies that model the presence of the tumour tissues with level sets. It is difficult to robustly segment mammogram image due to low contrast between normal and lesion tissues. Therefore, Chan-Vese level set method is used to extract the initial contour of mammograms and deep learning convolutional neural network (DL-CNN) algorithm is used to learn the features of mammary-specific mass and microcalcification clusters. To increase the classification accuracy and reduce the false positives, a well-known fully complex-valued relaxation network classifier is used in the last stage of DL-CNN network. Experimental results using the standard benchmarking breast cancer dataset (MIAS and BCDR) show that the proposed method exhibits significant improvement in performance over the traditional methods. Performance measures such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, AUC achieved are 99%, 0.9875, 1.0 and 0.9815, respectively. The proposed framework performs well in classifying the digital mammograms as normal, benign or malignant and its subclasses as well."
2022,Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes for treatment of solid tumors: It takes two to tango?,"Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), frontline soldiers of the adaptive immune system, are recruited into the tumor site to fight against tumors. However, their small number and reduced activity limit their ability to overcome the tumor. Enhancement of TILs number and activity against tumors has been of interest for a long time. A lack of knowledge about the tumor microenvironment (TME) has limited success in primary TIL therapies. Although the advent of engineered T cells has revolutionized the immunotherapy methods of hematologic cancers, the heterogeneity of solid tumors warrants the application of TILs with a wide range of specificity. Recent advances in understanding TME, immune exhaustion, and immune checkpoints have paved the way for TIL therapy regimens. Nowadays, TIL therapy has regained attention as a safe personalized immunotherapy, and currently, several clinical trials are evaluating the efficacy of TIL therapy in patients who have failed conventional immunotherapies. Gaining favorable outcomes following TIL therapy of patients with metastatic melanoma, cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer has raised hope in patients with refractory solid tumors, too. Nevertheless, TIL therapy procedures face several challenges, such as high cost, timely expansion, and technical challenges in selecting and activating the cells. Herein, we reviewed the recent advances in the TIL therapy of solid tumors and discussed the challenges and perspectives."
2018,Support vector machine for breast cancer classification using diffusion‐weighted MRI histogram features: Preliminary study,"Diffusion‐weighted MRI (DWI) is currently one of the fastest developing MRI‐based techniques in oncology. Histogram properties from model fitting of DWI are useful features for differentiation of lesions, and classification can potentially be improved by machine learning."
2019,Assessment of Machine Learning of Breast Pathology Structures for Automated Differentiation of Breast Cancer and High-Risk Proliferative Lesions,"Key Points Question Can computer vision and machine learning methods be used for automated diagnosis of preinvasive and invasive lesions of the breast to improve diagnostic accuracy? Findings This diagnostic study of 240 breast biopsies categorized by 3 expert pathologists evaluated 2 sets of image features, which achieved sensitivity and specificity comparable with 87 pathologists in the diagnosis of breast biopsy samples. The computer-based, automated approach outperformed pathologists in differentiating ductal carcinoma in situ from atypia. Meaning The findings suggest that machine learning methods are potentially suitable as diagnostic support systems in differentiating challenging preinvasive lesions of the breast."
2021,Evaluating the Accuracy of Breast Cancer and Molecular Subtype Diagnosis by Ultrasound Image Deep Learning Model,"Background: Breast ultrasound is the first choice for breast tumor diagnosis in China, but the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) categorization routinely used in the clinic often leads to unnecessary biopsy. Radiologists have no ability to predict molecular subtypes with important pathological information that can guide clinical treatment. Materials and Methods: This retrospective study collected breast ultrasound images from two hospitals and formed training, test and external test sets after strict selection, which included 2,822, 707, and 210 ultrasound images, respectively. An optimized deep learning model (DLM) was constructed with the training set, and the performance was verified in both the test set and the external test set. Diagnostic results were compared with the BI-RADS categorization determined by radiologists. We divided breast cancer into different molecular subtypes according to hormone receptor (HR) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression. The ability to predict molecular subtypes using the DLM was confirmed in the test set. Results: In the test set, with pathological results as the gold standard, the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 85.6, 98.7, and 63.1%, respectively, according to the BI-RADS categorization. The same set achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 89.7, 91.3, and 86.9%, respectively, when using the DLM. For the test set, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.96. For the external test set, the AUC was 0.90. The diagnostic accuracy was 92.86% with the DLM in BI-RADS 4a patients. Approximately 70.76% of the cases were judged as benign tumors. Unnecessary biopsy was theoretically reduced by 67.86%. However, the false negative rate was 10.4%. A good prediction effect was shown for the molecular subtypes of breast cancer with the DLM. The AUC were 0.864, 0.811, and 0.837 for the triple-negative subtype, HER2 (+) subtype and HR (+) subtype predictions, respectively. Conclusion: This study showed that the DLM was highly accurate in recognizing breast tumors from ultrasound images. Thus, the DLM can greatly reduce the incidence of unnecessary biopsy, especially for patients with BI-RADS 4a. In addition, the predictive ability of this model for molecular subtypes was satisfactory,which has specific clinical application value."
2022,Breast Cancer Screening Using Machine Learning Models,"The main objective of this paper is the development of an Algorithm for Boolean Breast Cancer Classification based on 116 patients with results by testing blood along with physical information (life, BMI, Gluco-level, diabetes, etc.). The following machine learning models were compared for performance in this study: choice tree, arbitrary forest, K-closest neighbors, ANN, AVM, and replace analysis. With the following methodologies, the information was gathered: Data is separated among 80 percent training and 20 percent testing using k-fold cross-validation (k 10). Initially, the average of accuracy, as well as sensitivity, are examined, while the counts of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, also region subjected to a number of tests were analyzed in the second. Later on, mass measures of mammography are likely to be conducted on terrible cancers. As a result, other techniques could be used in such evaluations to enhance choice, also ML could give a lot of value and an excellent cost-effective ratio in the breast cancer diagnosis strategy. In previous times, various research publications on breast-cancer indicators are been published. The applied strategy would look at two analytical parameters: the linear calibration curve and maturity. The q-parameter, Pearson-correlation analysis, also intake parameters dependency, the experiment only along the parameters having a criterion of the importance of 6% is also calculated with the evaluation of the standard deviation (evaluated with the KS experiment), these could be as Gluco-level, diabetic, resisting, and prototype for assessing equilibrium. The arbitrary forest is utilized for the learning procedure along with 10 factors as the best final classifier, with 84 percent accuracy, 100%_sensitivity, 65%_specificity, also 0.90 curved surface region."
2014,"Synthesis, Characterization and In Vitro Study of Biocompatible Cinnamaldehyde Functionalized Magnetite Nanoparticles (CPGF Nps) For Hyperthermia and Drug Delivery Applications in Breast Cancer","Cinnamaldehyde, the bioactive component of the spice cinnamon, and its derivatives have been shown to possess anti-cancer activity against various cancer cell lines. However, its hydrophobic nature invites attention for efficient drug delivery systems that would enhance the bioavailability of cinnamaldehyde without affecting its bioactivity. Here, we report the synthesis of stable aqueous suspension of cinnamaldehyde tagged Fe3O4 nanoparticles capped with glycine and pluronic polymer (CPGF NPs) for their potential application in drug delivery and hyperthermia in breast cancer. The monodispersed superparamagnetic NPs had an average particulate size of ∼20 nm. TGA data revealed the drug payload of ∼18%. Compared to the free cinnamaldehyde, CPGF NPs reduced the viability of breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and MDAMB231, at lower doses of cinnamaldehyde suggesting its increased bioavailability and in turn its therapeutic efficacy in the cells. Interestingly, the NPs were non-toxic to the non-cancerous HEK293 and MCF10A cell lines compared to the free cinnamaldehyde. The novelty of CPGF nanoparticulate system was that it could induce cytotoxicity in both ER/PR positive/Her2 negative (MCF7) and ER/PR negative/Her2 negative (MDAMB231) breast cancer cells, the latter being insensitive to most of the chemotherapeutic drugs. The NPs decreased the growth of the breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner and altered their migration through reduction in MMP-2 expression. CPGF NPs also decreased the expression of VEGF, an important oncomarker of tumor angiogenesis. They induced apoptosis in breast cancer cells through loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and activation of caspase-3. Interestingly, upon exposure to the radiofrequency waves, the NPs heated up to 41.6°C within 1 min, suggesting their promise as a magnetic hyperthermia agent. All these findings indicate that CPGF NPs prove to be potential nano-chemotherapeutic agents in breast cancer."
2018,Quantitative assessment of cancer cell morphology and motility using telecentric digital holographic microscopy and machine learning,"The noninvasive, fast acquisition of quantitative phase maps using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) allows tracking of rapid cellular motility on transparent substrates. On two‐dimensional surfaces in vitro, MDA‐MB‐231 cancer cells assume several morphologies related to the mode of migration and substrate stiffness, relevant to mechanisms of cancer invasiveness in vivo. The quantitative phase information from DHM may accurately classify adhesive cancer cell subpopulations with clinical relevance. To test this, cells from the invasive breast cancer MDA‐MB‐231 cell line were cultured on glass, tissue‐culture treated polystyrene, and collagen hydrogels, and imaged with DHM followed by epifluorescence microscopy after staining F‐actin and nuclei. Trends in cell phase parameters were tracked on the different substrates, during cell division, and during matrix adhesion, relating them to F‐actin features. Support vector machine learning algorithms were trained and tested using parameters from holographic phase reconstructions and cell geometric features from conventional phase images, and used to distinguish between elongated and rounded cell morphologies. DHM was able to distinguish between elongated and rounded morphologies of MDA‐MB‐231 cells with 94% accuracy, compared to 83% accuracy using cell geometric features from conventional brightfield microscopy. This finding indicates the potential of DHM to detect and monitor cancer cell morphologies relevant to cell cycle phase status, substrate adhesion, and motility. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry"
2018,Effects of Media Exposure to Conflicting Information About Mammography: Results From a Population-based Survey Experiment.,"Background Although there is growing theoretical and empirical support for the proposition that media exposure to conflicting health information negatively influences public understanding and behavior, few studies have causally linked exposure to conflict with undesirable outcomes. Such outcomes might be particularly likely in the context of mammography, given widespread media attention to conflicting recommendations about the age at and frequency with which average-risk women should be screened for breast cancer. Purpose The current study tests whether exposure to conflicting information about mammography negatively influences women's affective and cognitive responses and examines whether effects vary by socioeconomic position. Methods We conducted an online survey experiment in 2016 with a population-based sample of U.S. women aged 35-55 (N = 1,474). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four conditions that differed in the level of conflict about mammography presented in a news story (no, low, medium, or high conflict), stratifying by poverty level. Results Greater exposure to conflict increased women's negative emotional responses to the story they read, their confusion about and backlash toward cancer prevention recommendations and research, and their ambivalence about mammography and other types of cancer screening, though ambivalence leveled off at high levels of exposure. There was little evidence that effects varied across socioeconomic position. Conclusions Findings add to the growing evidence base documenting undesirable outcomes of exposure to conflicting health information. Future research should examine whether the negative affective and cognitive responses observed translate into behavior, which could have implications for both health campaigns and patient-provider communication."
2019,Screening Breast Ultrasound Using Handheld or Automated Technique in Women with Dense Breasts.,"In women with dense breasts (heterogeneously or extremely dense), adding screening ultrasound to mammography increases detection of node-negative invasive breast cancer. Similar incremental cancer detection rates averaging 2.1-2.7 per 1000 have been observed for physician- and technologist-performed handheld ultrasound (HHUS) and automated ultrasound (AUS). Adding screening ultrasound (US) for women with dense breasts significantly reduces interval cancer rates. Training is critical before interpreting examinations for both modalities, and a learning curve to achieve optimal performance has been observed. On average, about 3% of women will be recommended for biopsy on the prevalence round because of screening US, with a wide range of 2%-30% malignancy rates for suspicious findings seen only on US. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System 3 lesions identified only on screening HHUS can be safely followed at 1 year rather than 6 months. Computer-aided detection and diagnosis software can augment performance of AUS and HHUS; ongoing research on machine learning and deep learning algorithms will likely improve outcomes and workflow with screening US."
2016,Synergistic Chemo-Photothermal Therapy of Breast Cancer by Mesenchymal Stem Cell-Encapsulated Yolk-Shell GNR@HPMO-PTX Nanospheres.,"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have attracted increasing attention as vehicles for cancer treatment. Herein, MSC-based synergistic oncotherapy strategy is presented for the first time. To achieve this goal, yolk-shell structured gold nanorod embedded hollow periodic mesoporous organosilica nanospheres (GNR@HPMOs) with high paclitaxel (PTX) loading capability and excellent photothermal transfer ability upon near-infrared (NIR) light irradiation are first prepared. Cytotoxicity and migration assays show that the viability and tumor-homing capability of MSCs are well-retained after internalization of high content of PTX loaded GNR@HPMOs (denoted as GNR@HPMOs-PTX). In vitro experiments show the GNR@HPMOs-PTX loaded MSCs (GNR@HPMOs-PTX@MSCs) possess synergistic chemo-photothermal killing effects for breast cancer cells. Also, photoacoustic imaging shows that the MSCs can improve dispersion and distribution in tumor tissue for GNR@HPMOs-PTX after intratumoral injection. In vivo experiments in breast cancer model of nude mice further demonstrate that the GNR@HPMOs-PTX@MSCs significantly inhibit tumor growth, suggesting their great potential for synergistic therapy of cancer."
2016,Mathematical model development to detect breast cancer using multigene genetic programming,"Breast cancer is one of the world's leading causes of cancer death of women. Generally, human breast tissue cells emerge this cancer. This causes loss of breast as well as precious lives. Usually in people over 50 years have the risk of this types of cancer. So, early detection for this disease is very crucial to save the valuable lives. This paper develops a 10 fold cross validated mathematical model to detect breast cancer using symbolic regression of multigene genetic programming (MGGP). Data for MGGP is retrieved from UCI machine learning repository data set and is used for training and testing the 10 fold cross validated mathematical model. The developed model produces fast and accurate results for both training and testing data set. The error rate is very negligible for both benign and malignant type of breast cancer. The cross validated model shows the higher accuracy with respect to existing techniques."
2015,Urban-Rural Disparity of Breast Cancer and Socioeconomic Risk Factors in China,"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide. The primary aim of this work is the study of breast cancer disparity among Chinese women in urban vs. rural regions and its associations with socioeconomic factors. Data on breast cancer incidence were obtained from the Chinese cancer registry annual report (2005–2009). The ten socioeconomic factors considered in this study were obtained from the national population 2000 census and the Chinese city/county statistical yearbooks. Student’s T test was used to assess disparities of female breast cancer and socioeconomic factors in urban vs. rural regions. Pearson correlation and ordinary least squares (OLS) models were employed to analyze the relationships between socioeconomic factors and cancer incidence. It was found that the breast cancer incidence was significantly higher in urban than in rural regions. Moreover, in urban regions, breast cancer incidence remained relatively stable, whereas in rural regions it displayed an annual percentage change (APC) of 8.55. Among the various socioeconomic factors considered, breast cancer incidence exhibited higher positive correlations with population density, percentage of non-agriculture population, and second industry output. On the other hand, the incidence was negatively correlated with the percentage of population employed in primary industry. Overall, it was observed that higher socioeconomic status would lead to a higher breast cancer incidence in China. When studying breast cancer etiology, special attention should be paid to environmental pollutants, especially endocrine disruptors produced during industrial activities. Lastly, the present work’s findings strongly recommend giving high priority to the development of a systematic nationwide breast cancer screening program for women in China; with sufficient participation, mammography screening can considerably reduce mortality among women."
2020,Synergistic platinum (II) prodrug nanoparticle for enhanced breast cancer therapy.,"Chemotherapy still accounts for a large proportion in the treatments of tumors, but the drug resistance and side effects caused by long-term chemotherapy should not be underestimated. In this work, the drug combination strategy has been widely developed to overcome the side effects brought by the use of single drugs and improve the therapeutic effect. However, in clinical applications, co-delivery of drugs is very difficult, and different in vivo kinetics due to different drug properties will lead to a decrease in efficacy. Thus, the design of novel anti-tumor therapeutic agents, including new platinum agents represent an area in need of urgent attention. Our investigation implies a promising strategy for the design of a platinum prodrug to enhance the treatment of breast cancer. Dual-drug delivery nanoparticle was developed for enhanced treatment of breast cancer based on two-into-one co-delivery strategy. Through the synergistic effect of released cisplatin hydrate and tolfenamic acid (COX-2 inhibitor) from the coordination prodrug, tumor growth is significantly suppressed, and survival time is greatly extended in breast tumor-bearing mice."
2020,Deep Manifold Preserving Autoencoder for Classifying Breast Cancer Histopathological Images,"Classifying breast cancer histopathological images automatically is an important task in computer assisted pathology analysis. However, extracting informative and non-redundant features for histopathological image classification is challenging due to the appearance variability caused by the heterogeneity of the disease, the tissue preparation, and staining processes. In this paper, we propose a new feature extractor, called deep manifold preserving autoencoder, to learn discriminative features from unlabeled data. Then, we integrate the proposed feature extractor with a softmax classifier to classify breast cancer histopathology images. Specifically, it learns hierarchal features from unlabeled image patches by minimizing the distance between its input and output, and simultaneously preserving the geometric structure of the whole input data set. After the unsupervised training, we connect the encoder layers of the trained deep manifold preserving autoencoder with a softmax classifier to construct a cascade model and fine-tune this deep neural network with labeled training data. The proposed method learns discriminative features by preserving the structure of the input datasets from the manifold learning view and minimizing reconstruction error from the deep learning view from a large amount of unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on the public breast cancer dataset (BreaKHis) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method."
2022,Breast Cancer Mammograms Classification Using Deep Neural Network and Entropy-Controlled Whale Optimization Algorithm,"Breast cancer has affected many women worldwide. To perform detection and classification of breast cancer many computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been established because the inspection of the mammogram images by the radiologist is a difficult and time taken task. To early diagnose the disease and provide better treatment lot of CAD systems were established. There is still a need to improve existing CAD systems by incorporating new methods and technologies in order to provide more precise results. This paper aims to investigate ways to prevent the disease as well as to provide new methods of classification in order to reduce the risk of breast cancer in women’s lives. The best feature optimization is performed to classify the results accurately. The CAD system’s accuracy improved by reducing the false-positive rates.The Modified Entropy Whale Optimization Algorithm (MEWOA) is proposed based on fusion for deep feature extraction and perform the classification. In the proposed method, the fine-tuned MobilenetV2 and Nasnet Mobile are applied for simulation. The features are extracted, and optimization is performed. The optimized features are fused and optimized by using MEWOA. Finally, by using the optimized deep features, the machine learning classifiers are applied to classify the breast cancer images. To extract the features and perform the classification, three publicly available datasets are used: INbreast, MIAS, and CBIS-DDSM. The maximum accuracy achieved in INbreast dataset is 99.7%, MIAS dataset has 99.8% and CBIS-DDSM has 93.8%. Finally, a comparison with other existing methods is performed, demonstrating that the proposed algorithm outperforms the other approaches."
2018,A deep learning classifier for prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy from baseline breast DCE-MRI,"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is routinely used to treat breast tumors before surgery to reduce tumor size and improve outcome. However, no current clinical or imaging metrics can effectively predict before treatment which NAC recipients will achieve pathological complete response (pCR), the absence of residual invasive disease in the breast or lymph nodes following surgical resection. In this work, we developed and applied a convolu- tional neural network (CNN) to predict pCR from pre-treatment dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) scans on a per-voxel basis. In this study, DCE-MRI data for a total of 166 breast cancer pa- tients from the ISPY1 Clinical Trial were split into a training set of 133 patients and a testing set of 33 patients. A CNN consisting of 6 convolutional blocks was trained over 30 epochs. The pre-contrast and post-contrast DCE-MRI phases were considered in isolation and conjunction. A CNN utilizing a combination of both pre- and post-contrast images best distinguished responders, with an AUC of 0.77; 82% of the patients in the testing set were correctly classified based on their treatment response. Within the testing set, the CNN was able to produce probability heatmaps that visualized tumor regions that most strongly predicted therapeutic response. Multi- variate analysis with prognostic clinical variables (age, largest diameter, hormone receptor and HER2 status), revealed that the network was an independent predictor of response (p=0.05), and that the inclusion of HER2 status could further improve capability to predict response (AUC = 0.85, accuracy = 85%)."
2014,Vangl1 and Vangl2: planar cell polarity components with a developing role in cancer.,"Cancers commonly reactivate embryonic developmental pathways to promote the aggressive behavior of their cells, resulting in metastasis and poor patient outcome. While developmental pathways such as canonical Wnt signaling and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition have received much attention, our understanding of the role of the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in tumor progression remains rudimentary. Protein components of PCP, including a subset that overlaps with the canonical Wnt pathway, partition in polarized epithelial cells along the planar axis and are required for the establishment and maintenance of lateral epithelial polarity. Significant insight into PCP regulation of developmental and cellular processes has come from analysis of the functions of the core PCP scaffolding proteins Vangl1 and Vangl2. In particular, studies on zebrafish and with Looptail (Lp) mice, which harbor point mutations in Vangl2 that alter its trafficking and localization, point to roles for the PCP pathway in maintaining cell polarization along both the apical-basal and planar axes as well as in collective cell motility and invasiveness. Recent findings have suggested that the Vangls can promote similar processes in tumor cells. Initial data-mining efforts suggest that VANGL1 and VANGL2 are dysregulated in human cancers, and estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer patients whose tumors exhibit elevated VANGL1 expression suffer from shortened overall survival. Overall, evidence is beginning to accumulate that the heightened cellular motility and invasiveness associated with PCP reactivation may contribute to the malignancy of some cancer subtypes."
2019,Therapeutic Perspectives of Molecules from Urtica dioica Extracts for Cancer Treatment,"A large range of chronic and degenerative diseases can be prevented through the use of food products and food bioactives. This study reports the health benefits and biological activities of the Urtica dioica (U. dioica) edible plant, with particular focus on its cancer chemopreventive potential. Numerous studies have attempted to investigate the most efficient anti-cancer therapy with few side effects and high toxicity on cancer cells to overcome the chemoresistance of cancer cells and the adverse effects of current therapies. In this regard, natural products from edible plants have been assessed as sources of anti-cancer agents. In this article, we review current knowledge from studies that have examined the cytotoxic, anti-tumor and anti-metastatic effects of U. dioica plant on several human cancers. Special attention has been dedicated to the treatment of breast cancer, the most prevalent cancer among women and one of the main causes of death worldwide. The anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of U. dioica have been demonstrated on different human cancers, investigating the properties of U. dioica at cellular and molecular levels. The potent cytotoxicity and anti-cancer activity of the U. dioica extracts are due to its bioactive natural products content, including polyphenols which reportedly possess anti-oxidant, anti-mutagenic and anti-proliferative properties. The efficacy of this edible plant to prevent or mitigate human cancers has been demonstrated in laboratory conditions as well as in experimental animal models, paving the way to the development of nutraceuticals for new anti-cancer therapies."
2016,Possible Pathways of Capecitabine-Induced Hand-Foot Syndrome.,"Capecitabine, an oral prodrug of 5-fluorouracil, inhibits DNA synthesis and has received FDA approval for treatment of metastatic colorectal and breast cancers. Hand-foot syndrome (HFS) is a serious dose-limiting toxicity and the most frequently reported side effect of capecitabine. Because of the lack of knowledge about the causative mechanism of HFS, scarce information is available for effective treatment or prevention. Data are based on published literatures and reports available from the HFS development program database. The purpose of this Review is to provide information regarding definition, clinical manifestation, and the possible mechanisms of HFS induced by capecitabine. Ethnic variations in the clinical presentation of HFS warrant further attention. Several physiological and pharmacological mechanisms have been investigated, such as cyclooxygenase (COX) inflammatory-type reaction, accumulation of capecitabine metabolites, and enzymes and transporters involved in the metabolism and absorption. Although current studies describe the possible mechanisms of HFS induced by capecitabine, much remains to be determined. It appears from this scientific evidence that additional study is needed to determine the effect of skin-mediated metabolism in the possible mechanism of HFS induced by capecitabine."
2021,Assessment and Prediction of Response to Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy in Breast Cancer: A Comparison of Imaging Modalities and Future Perspectives,"Simple Summary Nowadays patients affected by locally advanced breast cancer and particular subtypes of early breast cancer may benefit from neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) before surgery with different advantageous, like reduction of tumor size and prognosis improvement. Pathological complete response to NAC is very variable amongst all different histological and immunophenotypic subtypes of breast cancer and its correct assessment by imaging is crucial for treatment planning, as patients could be addressed to conservative or demolitive breast surgery with reconstruction. Advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI and nuclear medicine, recently contributed to the prediction of chemotherapy response in the early phase of NAC, to avoid side effects and psychological implications of the oncological treatment in patients who are supposed to be unresponsive. This review article aims to compare different imaging techniques for both assessment and prediction of response to NAC and explain the new revolutionary contribute offered by Artifical Intelligence in this field. Abstract Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is becoming the standard of care for locally advanced breast cancer, aiming to reduce tumor size before surgery. Unfortunately, less than 30% of patients generally achieve a pathological complete response and approximately 5% of patients show disease progression while receiving NAC. Accurate assessment of the response to NAC is crucial for subsequent surgical planning. Furthermore, early prediction of tumor response could avoid patients being overtreated with useless chemotherapy sections, which are not free from side effects and psychological implications. In this review, we first analyze and compare the accuracy of conventional and advanced imaging techniques as well as discuss the application of artificial intelligence tools in the assessment of tumor response after NAC. Thereafter, the role of advanced imaging techniques, such as MRI, nuclear medicine, and new hybrid PET/MRI imaging in the prediction of the response to NAC is described in the second part of the review. Finally, future perspectives in NAC response prediction, represented by AI applications, are discussed."
2015,Mining Big Data: Breast Cancer Prediction using DT - SVM Hybrid Model,"- Breast Cancer is becoming a leading cause of death among women in the whole world; meanwhile, it is confirmed that the early detection and accurate diagnosis of this disease can ensure a long survival of the patients. This paper work presents a disease status prediction employing a hybrid methodology to forecast the changes and its consequence that is crucial for lethal infections. To alarm the severity of the diseases, our strategy consists of two main parts: 1. Information Treatment and Option Extraction, and 2. Decision Tree-Support Vector Machine (DT-SVM) Hybrid Model for predictions. We analyse the breast Cancer data available from the Wisconsin dataset from UCI machine learning with the aim of developing accurate prediction models for breast cancer using data mining techniques. In this experiment, we compare three classifications techniques in Weka software and comparison results show that DT-SVM has higher prediction accuracy than Instance-based learning (IBL), Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) and Naïve based classifiers."
2021,Malignant and Benign Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning Algorithms,"At the moment, the most prevalent form of cancer diagnosed in women across the globe is breast cancer. It develops in the breast tissue and is one of the most frequent causes of women’s death. This cancer can be cured if it is diagnosed at preliminary stage. Malignant and benign are two types of tumor found in case of breast cancer. Malignant tumors are deadly as their rate of growth is much higher than benign tumors. So, early identification of tumor type is pivotal for the appropriate treatment of a patient having breast cancer. In this work, Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset has been used which was collected from UCI repository. Our goal is to analyze the dataset and evaluate the performance of various machine learning algorithms for predicting breast cancer. Here, Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes and Random Forest classifiers have been implemented for classifying tumors into benign and malignant. The accuracy of each algorithm is calculated and compared to find the most suitable one. Based on the analysis, Random Forest and Support Vector Machine outperform other classifiers with accuracy of 96.5%. These classifiers can be used to build an automatic diagnostic system for preliminary diagnosis of breast cancer."
2020,The Utility of Deep Learning in Breast Ultrasonic Imaging: A Review,"Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer in women; it poses a serious threat to women’s health. Thus, early detection and proper treatment can improve patient prognosis. Breast ultrasound is one of the most commonly used modalities for diagnosing and detecting breast cancer in clinical practice. Deep learning technology has made significant progress in data extraction and analysis for medical images in recent years. Therefore, the use of deep learning for breast ultrasonic imaging in clinical practice is extremely important, as it saves time, reduces radiologist fatigue, and compensates for a lack of experience and skills in some cases. This review article discusses the basic technical knowledge and algorithms of deep learning for breast ultrasound and the application of deep learning technology in image classification, object detection, segmentation, and image synthesis. Finally, we discuss the current issues and future perspectives of deep learning technology in breast ultrasound."
2019,Breast Cancer Detection using Machine Learning Way,"Affording in the direction of Breast Cancer Organization, Breast Cancer is solitary and one and only of the most perilous sorts of viruses that is located operative for females in the biosphere. By way of experimental professional distinguishing this cancer in her initial phase aids in abiding breathes. Based on cancer.net proposal individualized funnels for additional 120 kinds of cancer and correlated to genetic diseases. Aimed At discovering breast cancer fundamentally AI rehearses are utilized. We have foreseen adaptive ensemble voting scheme for broke down breast cancer with WBC (Wisconsin Breast Cancer) record. Intention of our effort is to associate & describe in what way CNN and logistic algorithm afford used for detecting breast cancer yet the variables are condensed. Here remain 2 categories of tumours be situated. Benign tumour and malignant tumours, where benign tumour is non-cancer and malignant is cancer tumour"
2015,Modulation of Aromatase by Phytoestrogens,"The aromatase enzyme catalyzes the conversion of androgens to estrogens in many human tissues. Estrogens are known to stimulate cellular proliferation associated with certain cancers and protect against adverse symptoms during the peri- and postmenopausal intervals. Phytoestrogens are a group of plant derived naturally occurring compounds that have chemical structures similar to estrogen. Since phytoestrogens are known to be constituents of animal/human food sources, these compounds have received increased research attention. Phytoestrogens may contribute to decreased cancer risk by the inhibition of aromatase enzyme activity and CYP19 gene expression in human tissues. This review covers (a) the aromatase enzyme (historical descriptions on function, activity, and gene characteristics), (b) phytoestrogens in their classifications and applications to human health, and (c) a chronological coverage of aromatase activity modulated by phytoestrogens from the early 1980s to 2015. In general, phytoestrogens act as aromatase inhibitors by (a) decreasing aromatase gene expression, (b) inhibiting the aromatase enzyme itself, or (c) in some cases acting at both levels of regulation. The findings presented herein are consistent with estrogen's impact on health and phytoestrogen's potential as anticancer treatments, but well-controlled, large-scale studies are warranted to determine the effectiveness of phytoestrogens on breast cancer and age-related diseases."
2020,Rationally Designed Ruthenium Complexes for Breast Cancer Therapy,"Since the discovery of the anticancer potential of ruthenium-based complexes, several species were reported as promising candidates for the treatment of breast cancer, which accounts for the greatest number of new cases in women every year worldwide. Among these ruthenium complexes, species containing bioactive ligand(s) have attracted increasing attention due to their potential multitargeting properties, leading to anticancer drug candidates with a broader range of cellular targets/modes of action. This review of the literature aims at providing an overview of the rationally designed ruthenium-based complexes that have been reported to date for which ligands were carefully selected for the treatment of hormone receptor positive breast cancers (estrogen receptor (ER+) or progesterone receptor (PR+)). In addition, this brief survey highlights some of the most successful examples of ruthenium complexes reported for the treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a highly aggressive type of cancer, regardless of if their ligands are known to have the ability to achieve a specific biological function."
2015,Rational Polypharmacology: Systematically Identifying and Engaging Multiple Drug Targets To Promote Axon Growth.,"Mammalian central nervous system (CNS) neurons regrow their axons poorly following injury, resulting in irreversible functional losses. Identifying therapeutics that encourage CNS axon repair has been difficult, in part because multiple etiologies underlie this regenerative failure. This suggests a particular need for drugs that engage multiple molecular targets. Although multitarget drugs are generally more effective than highly selective alternatives, we lack systematic methods for discovering such drugs. Target-based screening is an efficient technique for identifying potent modulators of individual targets. In contrast, phenotypic screening can identify drugs with multiple targets; however, these targets remain unknown. To address this gap, we combined the two drug discovery approaches using machine learning and information theory. We screened compounds in a phenotypic assay with primary CNS neurons and also in a panel of kinase enzyme assays. We used learning algorithms to relate the compounds' kinase inhibition profiles to their influence on neurite outgrowth. This allowed us to identify kinases that may serve as targets for promoting neurite outgrowth as well as others whose targeting should be avoided. We found that compounds that inhibit multiple targets (polypharmacology) promote robust neurite outgrowth in vitro. One compound with exemplary polypharmacology was found to promote axon growth in a rodent spinal cord injury model. A more general applicability of our approach is suggested by its ability to deconvolve known targets for a breast cancer cell line as well as targets recently shown to mediate drug resistance."
2021,Hsa_circ_0000199 facilitates chemo-tolerance of triple-negative breast cancer by interfering with miR-206/613-led PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling,"Increasing attentions have been paid to the role of circRNAs in the etiology of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), and we strived to figure out the association of circRNA AKT3/miRNA axis with TNBC chemo-resistance. Altogether 207 BC patients were divided into TNBC group (n=83) and non-TNBC group (n=124), and MCF-10A, MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-468, SK-BR-3 and MCF-7 cell lines were prepared in advance. Expressions of AKT3-derived circRNAs and relevant miRNAs in the TNBC tissues and cell lines were determined by employing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). It was indicated that hsa_circ_0000199 expression was higher in TNBC tissues than in non-TNBC tissues, and high hsa_circ_0000199 expression was predictive of large tumor size, advanced TNM grade, high Ki-67 level and poor 3-year survival of TNBC patients (all P<0.05). Furthermore, miR-613 and miR-206 were sponged and negatively regulated by hsa_circ_0000199 (P<0.001), and PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling was depressed by si-hsa_circ_0000199 in TNBC cell lines (P<0.01). Ultimately, miR-206/miR-613 inhibitor reversed impacts of si-hsa_circ_0000199 on PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, proliferation, migration, invasion, chemo-sensitivity and autophagy of TNBC cells (all P<0.01). Conclusively, silencing of hsa_circ_0000199 enhanced TNBC chemo-sensitivity by promoting miR-206/miR-613 expression and deactivating PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling, which was conducive to improving chemotherapeutic efficacy of TNBC patients."
2020,Non-Invasive Assessment of Breast Cancer Molecular Subtypes with Multiparametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging Radiomics,"We evaluated the performance of radiomics and artificial intelligence (AI) from multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for the assessment of breast cancer molecular subtypes. Ninety-one breast cancer patients who underwent 3T dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) with apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) mapping were included retrospectively. Radiomic features were extracted from manually drawn regions of interest (n = 704 features per lesion) on initial DCE-MRI and ADC maps. The ten best features for subtype separation were selected using probability of error and average correlation coefficients. For pairwise comparisons with >20 patients in each group, a multi-layer perceptron feed-forward artificial neural network (MLP-ANN) was used (70% of cases for training, 30%, for validation, five times each). For all other separations, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and leave-one-out cross-validation were applied. Histopathology served as the reference standard. MLP-ANN yielded an overall median area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.86 (0.77–0.92) for the separation of triple negative (TN) from other cancers. The separation of luminal A and TN cancers yielded an overall median AUC of 0.8 (0.75–0.83). Radiomics and AI from multiparametric MRI may aid in the non-invasive differentiation of TN and luminal A breast cancers from other subtypes."
2014,"RDoC is necessary, but very oversold","The past half century has witnessed heroic advances in the basic sciences of brain research, genetics, and molecular biology. But there has also been a surprising and disappointing paradox: none of the exciting scientific findings has had any impact whatever on the everyday practice of clinical psychiatry. Fortunately, we have available effective treatments for most mental disorders, but there have been no real breakthroughs in our understanding of psychopathology and ways of treating it. Why the gaping disconnect between a basic science enterprise that is remarkably dynamic and a clinical practice that is relatively static? In fact, psychiatry is really not that different from the rest of medicine in this regard. All the medical specialties have faced (and so far have largely failed to negotiate) a similar bottleneck in translational research. It turns out to be lots easier to discover the fascinating secrets of bodily functioning than to turn these to any great clinical advantage. And because the brain is so much more complicated than other organs, psychiatry confronts by far the most challenging of all translational leaps. Our three pound brains manage to contain more neurons than there are stars in a galaxy, each connected to a thousand others and firing a thousand times a second, and with hundreds of proteins mediating the busy traffic at 100 trillion synapses. It is amazing that a machine with so many moving parts works as flawlessly as usually it does. By comparison, the breast is the most straightforward of organs, many orders of magnitude simpler than the brain. If, despite decades of intensive research, we are still early days in understanding breast cancer, why be surprised that we haven't yet gotten much of a handle on schizophrenia. When we published DSM-III in 1980, the research future for psychiatry seemed bright and likely to deliver a quick payoff for our patients. We had great hopes that deep understanding and practical solutions would emerge quickly from the happy conjunction of powerful new research tools, generous funding from National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and drug companies, and the availability of a reasonably reliable diagnostic system that provided specific targets for study and treatment. Soon enough, the journals were filled with seemingly exciting findings on the genetics of mental illness and were decorated with pretty pictures that purported to show brain malfunctioning in the different mental disorders. NIMH was at the center of the neuroscience enthusiasm, dubbing the 1990s the “decade of the brain” and betting the house on a narrow biological agenda to replace what previously had been a more balanced portfolio of research into not only the basic sciences, but also into treatments and health services. In effect, NIMH turned itself into a “brain institute” rather than an “institute of mental health”. Its efforts have succeeded in producing wonderful science, but have failed in helping patients. The brain has revealed the secrets of psychopathology only in frustratingly small packets, many of which do not replicate and none of which has been powerful enough to generate a diagnostic test or a treatment advance that would actually improve clinical practice. NIMH has grown understandably frustrated by this lack of progress and rightly has decided to switch to the new RDoC research track that is described in Cuthbert's paper (1). Rather than continue to study the hopelessly heterogeneous categories of DSM mental disorders, it will instead focus its attention on much simpler dimensions of mental functioning, hoping that these will yield clearer biological answers. Although the RDoC strategy is sound and necessary, the way it was recently announced to the public was badly muddled – misleading, poorly timed, and damaging to the credibility of both NIMH and the practice of clinical psychiatry. A provocative, widely reported press release came just three weeks before the publication of DSM-5. NIMH explicitly trashed all existing psychiatric diagnosis and instead offered RDoC as a better, biologically based, alternative approach. This unwise over-promising about the future blithely ignored the sobering lessons of the past and the glaring needs of our patients in the present. Lost in the bombast of the NIMH press release was that RDoC has absolutely nothing to offer in the present except an untested research tool. RDoC will almost certainly deliver nothing of practical import within this decade. My guess is that it will consist of a slow, steady slog of tiny steps, more characterized by frustrating blind alleys than by any great leaps forward. Granted that descriptive psychiatry (as embodied in both DSM and ICD) has limited specificity and almost no explanatory power, the fact remains that it is currently the only helpful approach to psychiatric diagnosis and continues to be essential and surprisingly useful in clinical practice. Take “schizophrenia” as an example. Our current construct is clearly a research nightmare: heterogeneous, overlapping with near neighbors, no uniform course or treatment response, and no clear pattern of gene or brain findings. Eventually this final common descriptive pathway – “schizophrenia” – will probably turn out to have hundreds of different causes and will require dozens of different treatments. But for now “schizophrenia” does very much inform clinical practice and RDoC has no replacement for it. Moreover, it is a dangerous myth to assume that patients who meet criteria for “schizophrenia” suffer only from a brain disease. Contextual forces play a large role in the onset of schizophrenia and very often are the most crucial elements in its successful management. A supportive environment, a decent place to live, and therapeutically encouraged engagement with school, work, and social activities are now, and always will be, absolute essentials. NIMH has had its attention so distracted by glorious dreams of a future research revolution that it has completely lost touch with the desperate suffering of schizophrenic patients in the present. It pays no attention to, and takes no responsibility for, the mess that is US mental health care. During the same fifty years that witnessed a basic science research revolution, the US has closed one million psychiatric hospital beds. But having provided too little care and housing in the community, we have been forced to open one million prison beds for psychiatric patients who were arrested for nuisance crimes, preventable had they received adequate community services and housing. These patients are suffering greatly not so much for lack of knowledge on how to care for them, but because of a lack of attention and inadequate resources. Patients with severe psychiatric illnesses are worse off in the United States than in other developed countries and their wholesale imprisonment is a throwback to the barbarity of two centuries ago. Meanwhile, NIMH has sat silently on the sidelines ignoring this shameful transinstitutionalization. It should, but does not, feel a strong responsibility to improve the lives of our patients right now – in all the many concrete ways that are already available to us if only there were adequate funding for them. NIMH should advocate in Congress for patients, not just for its own research budget. And the NIMH research budget should support a balanced portfolio across the entire spectrum – from bench to treatment and from treatment to community services. Gambles on brain research are certainly necessary for a better future, but should not dominate so completely over current need."
2020,Machine Learning techniques in breast cancer prognosis prediction: A primary evaluation,"More than 750 000 women in Italy are surviving a diagnosis of breast cancer. A large body of literature tells us which characteristics impact the most on their prognosis. However, the prediction of each disease course and then the establishment of a therapeutic plan and follow‐up tailored to the patient is still very complicated. In order to address this issue, a multidisciplinary approach has become widely accepted, while the Multigene Signature Panels and the Nottingham Prognostic Index are still discussed options. The current technological resources permit to gather many data for each patient. Machine Learning (ML) allows us to draw on these data, to discover their mutual relations and to esteem the prognosis for the new instances. This study provides a primary evaluation of the application of ML to predict breast cancer prognosis. We analyzed 1021 patients who underwent surgery for breast cancer in our Institute and we included 610 of them. Three outcomes were chosen: cancer recurrence (both loco‐regional and systemic) and death from the disease within 32 months. We developed two types of ML models for every outcome (Artificial Neural Network and Support Vector Machine). Each ML algorithm was tested in accuracy (=95.29%‐96.86%), sensitivity (=0.35‐0.64), specificity (=0.97‐0.99), and AUC (=0.804‐0.916). These models might become an additional resource to evaluate the prognosis of breast cancer patients in our daily clinical practice. Before that, we should increase their sensitivity, according to literature, by considering a wider population sample with a longer period of follow‐up. However, specificity, accuracy, minimal additional costs, and reproducibility are already encouraging."
2019,Tumor Characterization in Breast Cancer Identifies Immune-Relevant Gene Signatures Associated With Prognosis,"There has been increasing attention on immune-oncology for its impressive clinical benefits in many different malignancies. However, due to molecular and genetic heterogeneity of tumors, the activities of traditional clinical and pathological criteria are far from satisfactory. Immune-based strategies have re-ignited hopes for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer. Prognostic or predictive biomarkers, associated with tumor immune microenvironment, may have great prospects in guiding patient management, identifying new immune-related molecular markers, establishing personalized risk assessment of breast cancer. Therefore, in this study, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA), multivariate COX analysis, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator (LASSO), and support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) algorithm, along with a series of analyses were performed, and four immune-related genes (APOD, CXCL14, IL33, and LIFR) were identified as biomarkers correlated with breast cancer prognosis. The findings may provide different insights into prognostic monitoring of immune-related targets for breast cancer or can be served as reference for the further research and validation of biomarkers."
2018,The Interleukin-17 Family of Cytokines in Breast Cancer,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women worldwide and remains a major cause of mortality with an expected 137,000 death this year in Europe. Standard management of metastatic BC comprises hormonotherapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapies. Cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors have recently proved their efficiency in hormonal receptor expressing BC. Checkpoint proteins inhibition is being evaluated in phase 3 studies. Since inflammation is constantly present in cancers, research teams have focused their attention on the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family of proinflammatory cytokines. Preclinical experiments have reported both pro and antitumor effects depending on the conditions. In the present article, we review the accumulating evidences about the roles of IL-17 in BC and discuss whether this family of cytokines could be a new target in anticancer treatments."
2014,Un-met supportive care needs of Iranian breast cancer patients.,"BACKGROUND Assessment of supportive needs is the requirement to plan any supportive care program for cancer patients. There is no evidence about supportive care needs of Iranian breast cancer patients. So, the aims of present study were to investigate this question and s predictive factors. MATERIALS AND METHODS A descriptive- correlational study was conducted, followed by logistic regression analyses. The Supportive Care Needs Survey was completed by 136 breast cancer patients residing in Iran following their initial treatment. This assessed needs in five domains: psychological, health system and information, physical and daily living, patient care and support, and sexuality. RESULTS Patient perceived needs were highest in the health systems and information (71%), and physical and daily living (68%) domains. Logistic regression modeling revealed that younger participants have more un-met needs in all domains and those with more children reported fewer un-met needs in patient care and support domains. In addition, married women had more un-met supportive care needs related to sexuality. CONCLUSIONS The high rate of un-met supportive care needs in all domains suggests that supportive care services are desperately required for breast cancer patients in Iran. Moreover, services that address informational needs and physical and daily living needs ought to be the priority, with particular attention paid to younger women. Further research is clearly needed to fully understand supportive care needs in this cultural context."
2022,Deep Learning and Machine Learning with Grid Search to Predict Later Occurrence of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Clinical Data,"Background: It is important to be able to predict, for each individual patient, the likelihood of later metastatic occurrence, because the prediction can guide treatment plans tailored to a specific patient to prevent metastasis and to help avoid under-treatment or over-treatment. Deep neural network (DNN) learning, commonly referred to as deep learning, has become popular due to its success in image detection and prediction, but questions such as whether deep learning outperforms other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data remain unanswered. Grid search has been introduced to deep learning hyperparameter tuning for the purpose of improving its prediction performance, but the effect of grid search on other machine learning methods are under-studied. In this research, we take the empirical approach to study the performance of deep learning and other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis (BCM) 5, 10, or 15 years after the initial treatment. We developed prediction models using the deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) methods, as well as models using nine other machine learning methods, including naïve Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), LASSO, decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), and XGBoost (XGB). We used grid search to tune hyperparameters for all methods. We then compared our feedforward deep learning models to the models trained using the nine other machine learning methods. Results: Based on the mean test AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) results, DFNN ranks 6th, 4th, and 3rd when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM, respectively, out of 10 methods. The top performing methods in predicting 5-year BCM are XGB (1st), RF (2nd), and KNN (3rd). For predicting 10-year BCM, the top performers are XGB (1st), RF (2nd), and NB (3rd). Finally, for 15-year BCM, the top performers are SVM (1st), LR and LASSO (tied for 2nd), and DFNN (3rd). The ensemble methods RF and XGB outperform other methods when data are less balanced, while SVM, LR, LASSO, and DFNN outperform other methods when data are more balanced. Our statistical testing results show that at a significance level of 0.05, DFNN overall performs comparably to other machine learning methods when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM. Conclusions: Our results show that deep learning with grid search overall performs at least as well as other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data. It is interesting to note that some of the other machine learning methods, such as XGB, RF, and SVM, are very strong competitors of DFNN when incorporating grid search. It is also worth noting that the computation time required to do grid search with DFNN is much more than that required to do grid search with the other nine machine learning methods."
2014,A Kernel-Based Multivariate Feature Selection Method for Microarray Data Classification,"High dimensionality and small sample sizes, and their inherent risk of overfitting, pose great challenges for constructing efficient classifiers in microarray data classification. Therefore a feature selection technique should be conducted prior to data classification to enhance prediction performance. In general, filter methods can be considered as principal or auxiliary selection mechanism because of their simplicity, scalability, and low computational complexity. However, a series of trivial examples show that filter methods result in less accurate performance because they ignore the dependencies of features. Although few publications have devoted their attention to reveal the relationship of features by multivariate-based methods, these methods describe relationships among features only by linear methods. While simple linear combination relationship restrict the improvement in performance. In this paper, we used kernel method to discover inherent nonlinear correlations among features as well as between feature and target. Moreover, the number of orthogonal components was determined by kernel Fishers linear discriminant analysis (FLDA) in a self-adaptive manner rather than by manual parameter settings. In order to reveal the effectiveness of our method we performed several experiments and compared the results between our method and other competitive multivariate-based features selectors. In our comparison, we used two classifiers (support vector machine, -nearest neighbor) on two group datasets, namely two-class and multi-class datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our method is better than others, especially on three hard-classify datasets, namely Wang's Breast Cancer, Gordon's Lung Adenocarcinoma and Pomeroy's Medulloblastoma."
2019,lncRNA PLAC2 activated by H3K27 acetylation promotes cell proliferation and invasion via the activation of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in oral squamous cell carcinoma,"As a new group of important effector molecules involved in multiple cancer types, including breast cancer, lung cancer and oral squamous cell carcinoma, long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have attracted considerable attention recently. However, the underlying cause that induces the dysregulated lncRNAs in cancer remains poorly understood. In the present study, the regulatory model of the lncRNA placenta-specific protein 2 (PLAC2) upregulation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) was investigated and its biological functions in OSCC malignant progression was identified. A reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay identified that PLAC2 is upregulated in OSCC cell lines and primary tissue samples. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis followed by chromatin immunoprecipitation verified an enriched histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27) acetylation (H3K27ac) at the promoter region of the PLAC2 gene. Knockdown of cAMP-response element binding protein-binding protein (CBP) significantly reduced the enrichment level of H3K27ac, and thereby induced a decreased expression of PLAC2. Functionally, overexpression of PLAC2 promotes OSCC cell proliferation, migration and invasion, whereas knockdown of PLAC2 exerted an opposite effect. Furthermore, the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway was activated by PLAC2 and mediated the PLAC2-induced malignant progress of OSCC. In conclusion, the present results indicated that lncRNA PLAC2 is transcriptionally activated by H3K27ac modification at the promoter region in OSCC, and promotes cell growth and metastasis via activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Therefore, PLAC2 may serve as a promising biomarker for OSCC prognosis and therapy."
2016,Bisphenol A Increases the Migration and Invasion of Triple‐Negative Breast Cancer Cells via Oestrogen‐related Receptor Gamma,"Triple‐negative breast cancer (TNBC) is characterized by great metastasis and invasion capability. Our study revealed that nanomolar bisphenol A (BPA), one of the most ubiquitous endocrine disruptors, can increase wound closure and invasion of both MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. BPA treatment can increase protein and mRNA expression of matrix metalloproteinase‐2 (MMP‐2) and MMP‐9, while had no effect on the expression of vimentin (Vim) and fibronectin (FN) in TNBC cells. The expression of G‐protein‐coupled receptor (GPER), which has been suggested to mediate rapid oestrogenic signals, was not varied in BPA‐treated MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. Its inhibitor G15 also had no effect on BPA‐induced MMPs expression and cell invasion. Interestingly, BPA treatment can significantly increase the mRNA and protein expressions of oestrogen‐related receptor γ (ERRγ), but not ERRα or ERRβ, in both MDA‐MB‐231 and BT‐549 cells. The knock‐down of ERRγ can markedly attenuate BPA‐induced expression of MMP‐2 and MMP‐9 in TNBC cells. BPA treatment can activate both ERK1/2 and Akt in TNBC cells. Both inhibitors of ERK1/2 (PD98059) and Akt (LY294002) can attenuate BPA‐induced ERRγ expression and cell invasion of MDA‐MB‐231 cells. Collectively, our data revealed that BPA can increase the expression of MMPs and in vitro motility of TNBC cells via ERRγ. Both activation of ERK1/2 and Akt participated in this process. Our study suggests that more attention should be paid to the roles of xenoestrogens such as BPA in the development and progression of TNBC."
2014,Breast cancer in young women: special considerations in multidisciplinary care,"Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers in females, and 5%–7% of breast cancer cases occur in women under 40 years of age. Breast cancer in the young has gained increased attention with an attempt to improve diagnosis and prognosis. Young patients tend to have different epidemiology, presenting with later stages and more aggressive phenotypes. Diagnostic imaging is also more difficult in this age group. Multidisciplinary care generally encompasses surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, radiologists, and social workers. Other special considerations include reconstruction options, fertility, genetics, and psychosocial issues. These concerns enlarge the already diverse multidisciplinary team to incorporate new expertise, such as reproductive specialists and genetic counselors. This review encompasses an overview of the current multimodal treatment regimens and the unique challenges in treating this special population. Integration of diagnosis, treatment, and quality of life issues should be addressed and understood by each member in the interdisciplinary team in order to optimize outcomes."
2018,Microarray breast cancer data classification using machine learning methods,"In this study We used microarray breast cancer data for classification of the patients using machine learning methods. First, 8 different machine learning algorithms are applied to the data, without applying any feature selection methods. Then two different feature selection methods are applied. The results of the classifications are compared with each other and with the results of the first case. The methods applied are SVM, KNN, MLP, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Adaboost and Gradient Boosting Machines. After applying the two different feature selection methods with the best 50 features are applied, SVM gave the best results. MLP is applied using different number of layers and neurons to examine the effect of the number of layers and neurons on the classification accuracy. It is determined that the increase in the number of layers sometimes decreased, sometimes didn't change the accuracy."
2019,Predictive data mining approaches in medical diagnosis: A review of some diseases prediction,"Article history: Received: October 18, 2018 Received in revised format: December 20, 2018 Accepted: January 8, 2019 Available online: January 8, 2019 Due to the increasing technological advances in all fields, a considerable amount of data has been collected to be processed for different purposes.

2018,Fully automated detection of breast cancer in screening MRI using convolutional neural networks,"Abstract. Current computer-aided detection (CADe) systems for contrast-enhanced breast MRI rely on both spatial information obtained from the early-phase and temporal information obtained from the late-phase of the contrast enhancement. However, late-phase information might not be available in a screening setting, such as in abbreviated MRI protocols, where acquisition is limited to early-phase scans. We used deep learning to develop a CADe system that exploits the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans. This system uses three-dimensional (3-D) morphological information in the candidate locations and the symmetry information arising from the enhancement differences of the two breasts. We compared the proposed system to a previously developed system, which uses the full dynamic breast MRI protocol. For training and testing, we used 385 MRI scans, containing 161 malignant lesions. Performance was measured by averaging the sensitivity values between 1/8—eight false positives. In our experiments, the proposed system obtained a significantly (p=0.008) higher average sensitivity (0.6429±0.0537) compared with that of the previous CADe system (0.5325±0.0547). In conclusion, we developed a CADe system that is able to exploit the spatial information obtained from the early-phase scans and can be used in screening programs where abbreviated MRI protocols are used."
2017,Amphiphilic dendritic nanomicelle-mediated co-delivery of 5-fluorouracil and doxorubicin for enhanced therapeutic efficacy,"Abstract Combination cancer therapy has attracted considerable attention due to its enhanced antitumor efficacy and reduced toxicity granted by synergistic effects over monotherapy. The application of nanotechnology is expected to achieve coencapsulation of multiple anticancer agents with enhanced therapeutic efficacy. Herein, a unique nanomicelle based on amphiphilic dendrimer (AmD) consisting of a hydrophilic polyamidoamine dendritic shell and a hydrophobic polylactide core is developed for effectively loading and shuttling 5-fluorouracil (5-Fu) and doxorubicin (Dox). The yielded drug-encapsulated dendritic nanomicelle (5-Fu/Dox-DNM) has a modest average size of 68.6 ± 3.3 nm and shows pH-sensitive drug release manner. The parallel activity of 5-Fu and Dox show synergistic anticancer efficacy. The IC50 value of 5-Fu/Dox-DNM toward human breast cancer (MDA-MB-231) cells was 0.25 μg/mL, presenting an 11.2-fold and 6.1-fold increase in cytotoxicity compared to Dox-DNM and 5-Fu-DNM, respectively. Furthermore, 5-Fu/Dox-DNM significantly inhibits the progression of tumor growth in the MDA-MB-231 xenograft tumor mice model. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that our AmD-based combination therapeutic system has promising potential to open an avenue for coencapsulation of multiple chemotherapeutic agents to promote superior anticancer effect."
2020,Deep Learning Applied for Histological Diagnosis of Breast Cancer,"Deep learning, as one of the currently most popular computer science research trends, improves neural networks, which has more and deeper layers allowing higher abstraction levels and more accurate data analysis. Although deep convolutional neural networks, as a deep learning algorithm, has recently achieved promising results in data analysis, the requirement for a large amount of data prevents its use in medical data analysis since it is challenging to obtain data from the medical field. Breast cancer is a common cancer in women. To diagnose this kind of cancer, breast cell shapes in histopathology images should be examined by senior pathologists. The number of pathologists per population in the world is not enough, especially in Africa, and human mistake may occur in diagnosis procedure. After the evaluation of deep learning methods and algorithms in breast histological data processing, we tried to improve the current systems’ accuracy. As a result, this study proposes two effective deep transfer learning-based models, which rely on pre-trained DCNN using a large collection of ImageNet dataset images that improve current state-of-the-art systems in both binary and multiclass classification. We transfer pre-trained weights of the ResNet50 and DesneNet121 on the Imagenet as initial weights and fine-tune these models with a deep classifier with data augmentation to detect various malignant and benign samples tissues in the two categories of binary classification and multiclass classification. The proposed models have been examined with optimized hyperparameters in magnification-dependent and magnification-independent classification modes. In the multiclass classification, the proposed system achieved up to 98% accuracy. As for binary classification, the proposed system provides up to 100% accuracy. The results outperform previous studies accuracies in all defined performance metrics in breast cancer CAD systems from histological images."
2022,Role of ctDNA in Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary Circulating tumor DNA is DNA released by the tumor into the bloodstream. In breast cancer, it is used mainly in research or in clinical trials, but it will likely be used in routine clinical practice once certain issues have been worked out and methods of analysis have been improved and standardized. Breast cancer classification and treatment selection are now based on analysis of the tumor but circulating tumor DNA carries many features of the original tumor and can be analyzed from a simple, non-invasive blood extraction. Here, we review its potential role in early breast cancer (for screening, diagnosis, detection of minimal residual disease after surgery, follow up, and treatment) and in metastatic breast cancer (for the detection of mutations, prognosis and treatment). Abstract Breast cancer is currently classified by immunohistochemistry. However, technological advances in the detection of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) have made new options available for diagnosis, classification, biological knowledge, and treatment selection. Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease and ctDNA can accurately reflect this heterogeneity, allowing us to detect, monitor, and understand the evolution of the disease. Breast cancer patients have higher levels of circulating DNA than healthy subjects, and ctDNA can be used for different objectives at different timepoints of the disease, ranging from screening and early detection to monitoring for resistance mutations in advanced disease. In early breast cancer, ctDNA clearance has been associated with higher rates of complete pathological response after neoadjuvant treatment and with fewer recurrences after radical treatments. In metastatic disease, ctDNA can help select the optimal sequencing of treatments. In the future, thanks to new bioinformatics tools, the use of ctDNA in breast cancer will become more frequent, enhancing our knowledge of the biology of tumors. Moreover, deep learning algorithms may also be able to predict breast cancer evolution or treatment sensitivity. In the coming years, continued research and the improvement of liquid biopsy techniques will be key to the implementation of ctDNA analysis in routine clinical practice."
2023,Standalone AI for Breast Cancer Detection at Screening Digital Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Background There is considerable interest in the potential use of artificial intelligence (AI) systems in mammographic screening. However, it is essential to critically evaluate the performance of AI before it can become a modality used for independent mammographic interpretation. Purpose To evaluate the reported standalone performances of AI for interpretation of digital mammography and digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Google Scholar, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science databases for studies published from January 2017 to June 2022. Sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values were reviewed. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 and Comparative (QUADAS-2 and QUADAS-C, respectively). A random effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analysis were performed for overall studies and for different study types (reader studies vs historic cohort studies) and imaging techniques (digital mammography vs DBT). Results In total, 16 studies that include 1 108 328 examinations in 497 091 women were analyzed (six reader studies, seven historic cohort studies on digital mammography, and four studies on DBT). Pooled AUCs were significantly higher for standalone AI than radiologists in the six reader studies on digital mammography (0.87 vs 0.81, P = .002), but not for historic cohort studies (0.89 vs 0.96, P = .152). Four studies on DBT showed significantly higher AUCs in AI compared with radiologists (0.90 vs 0.79, P < .001). Higher sensitivity and lower specificity were seen for standalone AI compared with radiologists. Conclusion Standalone AI for screening digital mammography performed as well as or better than radiologists. Compared with digital mammography, there is an insufficient number of studies to assess the performance of AI systems in the interpretation of DBT screening examinations. © RSNA, 2023 Supplemental material is available for this article.

2016,Mitosis detection using convolutional neural network based features,"Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in women according to World Health Organization (WHO). Development of computer aided diagnostic (CAD) systems has great importance as a secondary reader systems for a correct diagnosis and treatment process. In this paper, a deep learning based feature extraction method by convolutional neural network (CNN) is proposed for automated mitosis detection for cancer diagnosis and grading by histopathological images. The proposed framework is tested on the MITOS data set provided for a contest on mitosis detection in breast cancer histological images released for research purposes in International Conference on Pattern Recognition (ICPR'2014). By using provided histopathological images, cellular structures are initially found by combined clustering based segmentation and blob analysis after preprocessing step. Then, obtained cellular image patches are cropped automatically from the histopathological images for feature extraction stage. CNN, which is a prominent deep learning method on image processing tasks, is utilized for extracting discriminative features. Due to the high dimensional output of the CNN, combination of PCA and LDA dimension reduction methods are performed respectively for regularization and dimension reduction process. Afterwards, a robust kernel based classifier, support vector machine (SVM), is used for final classification of mitotic and non-mitotic cells. The test results on MITOS data set prove that the proposed framework achieved promising results for mitosis detection on histopathological images."
2015,BREAST CANCER DIAGNOSIS AND RECURRENCE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES,"Breast Cancer has become the common cause of death among women. Due to long hours invested in manual diagnosis and lesser diagnostic system available emphasize the development of automated diagnosis for early diagnosis of the disease. Our aim is to classify whether the breast cancer is benign or malignant and predict the recurrence and non-recurrence of malignant cases after a certain period. To achieve this we have used machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, KNN and Naive Bayes. These techniques are coded in MATLAB using UCI machine learning depository. We have compared the accuracies of different techniques and observed the results. We found SVM most suited for predictive analysis and KNN performed best for our overall methodology."
2017,Gender and Sexual Labor Near the End of Life: Advanced Breast Cancer and Femininity Norms,"AbstractFeminist researchers have highlighted the increased hyper- and heterosexualization of breast cancer by drawing attention to the gendered dimensions of disease. In a set of interviews with women diagnosed with metastatic disease, I examined how participants labored to fulfill feminine gender and sexual ideals. Two themes were explored: gender labor, which included feeling fat and unattractive, and sexual labor, which included managing partners' sexual demands and sexual pain. This study builds on emergent feminist critiques that challenge expectations for a woman to be a “sexy cancer patient” and highlights how gender and sexual ideals continue to affect women negatively, even when they are extremely ill."
2019,Clustering-based undersampling with random over sampling examples and support vector machine for imbalanced classification of breast cancer diagnosis,"Abstract To overcome the two-class imbalanced classification problem existing in the diagnosis of breast cancer, a hybrid of Random Over Sampling Example, K-means and Support vector machine (RK-SVM) model is proposed which is based on sample selection. Random Over Sampling Example (ROSE) is utilized to balance the dataset and further improve the diagnosis accuracy by Support Vector Machine (SVM). As there is one different sample selection factor via clustering that encourages selecting the samples near the class boundary. The purpose of clustering here is to reduce the risk of removing useful samples and improve the efficiency of sample selection. To test the performance of the new hybrid classifier, it is implemented on breast cancer datasets and the other three datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which are commonly used datasets in class imbalanced learning. The extensive experimental results show that our proposed hybrid method outperforms most of the competitive algorithms in term of G-mean and accuracy indices. Additionally, experimental results show that this method also performs superiorly for binary problems."
2019,"Using Resistin, Glucose, Age and BMI and Pruning Fuzzy Neural Network for the Construction of Expert Systems in the Prediction of Breast Cancer","Research on predictions of breast cancer grows in the scientific community, providing data on studies in patient surveys. Predictive models link areas of medicine and artificial intelligence to collect data and improve disease assessments that affect a large part of the population, such as breast cancer. In this work, we used a hybrid artificial intelligence model based on concepts of neural networks and fuzzy systems to assist in the identification of people with breast cancer through fuzzy rules. The hybrid model can manipulate the data collected in medical examinations and identify patterns between healthy people and people with breast cancer with an acceptable level of accuracy. These intelligent techniques allow the creation of expert systems based on logical rules of the IF/THEN type. To demonstrate the feasibility of applying fuzzy neural networks, binary pattern classification tests were performed where the dimensions of the problem are used for a model, and the answers identify whether or not the patient has cancer. In the tests, experiments were replicated with several characteristics collected in the examinations done by medical specialists. The results of the tests, compared to other models commonly used for this purpose in the literature, confirm that the hybrid model has a tremendous predictive capacity in the prediction of people with breast cancer maintaining acceptable levels of accuracy with good ability to act on false positives and false negatives, assisting the scientific milieu with its forecasts with the significant characteristic of interpretability of breast cancer. In addition to coherent predictions, the fuzzy neural network enables the construction of systems in high level programming languages to build support systems for physicians’ actions during the initial stages of treatment of the disease with the fuzzy rules found, allowing the construction of systems that replicate the knowledge of medical specialists, disseminating it to other professionals.."
2023,Metaverse and Healthcare: Machine Learning-Enabled Digital Twins of Cancer,"Medical digital twins, which represent medical assets, play a crucial role in connecting the physical world to the metaverse, enabling patients to access virtual medical services and experience immersive interactions with the real world. One serious disease that can be diagnosed and treated using this technology is cancer. However, the digitalization of such diseases for use in the metaverse is a highly complex process. To address this, this study aims to use machine learning (ML) techniques to create real-time and reliable digital twins of cancer for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. The study focuses on four classical ML techniques that are simple and fast for medical specialists without extensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) knowledge, and meet the requirements of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) in terms of latency and cost. The case study focuses on breast cancer (BC), the second most prevalent form of cancer worldwide. The study also presents a comprehensive conceptual framework to illustrate the process of creating digital twins of cancer, and demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of these digital twins in monitoring, diagnosing, and predicting medical parameters."
2017,Breast cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity,"ABSTRACT Introduction: Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer affecting women worldwide. In every setting, the majority of women are treated with an evergrowing arsenal of therapeutic agents that have greatly improved their outcomes. However, these therapies can also be associated with significant adverse events. Areas covered: This review aims to thoroughly describe the current state of the evidence regarding the potential cardiotoxicity of agents commonly used in the treatment of breast cancer. These include chemotherapeutic agents, anti-HER2 therapies and CDK4/6 and mTOR inhibitors. Furthermore, issues related to the risk stratification and monitoring tools are explored. Expert opinion: Anthracycline- and trastuzumab-related cardiac toxicities have been extensively studied. Substantial evidence is now available concerning additional anti-HER2 agents such as pertuzumab, T-DM1 and tyrosine kinase inhibitors; overall, the cardiotoxicity profile is reassuring. Cardiac events due to endocrine therapy are mostly ischemic and, in the context of prolonged therapy, need specific attention. Novel agents implicated in the treatment of hormone receptor-positive disease are potentially arrhythmogenic and the exact risk will need to be further refined. As for today, assessment of baseline risk factors prior to treatment initiation and cardiac imaging before and during treatment remains the optimal way to prevent cardiac dysfunction. Cardioprotective therapy in primary prevention is still a matter of debate."
2021,Classification of Histopathological Images for Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning,"ABSTRACT Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly types of cancer that develops in the breast tissue of women worldwide. This is why researchers and experts are interested in developing a computer-aided diagnostic system (CAD) for diagnosing histopathological images of breast cancer. CAD has contributed to increasing the diagnostic accuracy of the biopsy tissue using eosin stained and hematoxylin images. Most CAD systems have used traditional methods to extract handcrafted features, which are imprecise in diagnosis and time-consuming. The diagnostics by both CAD and the calculations are used to reduce the pathologist’s workload and improve accuracy. In this study, the proposed convolutional neural network (AlexNet) approach to extract the deepest features from the BreaKHis dataset to diagnose breast cancer as either benign or malignant. In the current proposal, the study performed four experiments according to a magnification factor (40X, 100X, 200X and 400X). Each experiment contains 1407 images. The network was trained and validated on 80 % tissue images and 20 % for testing. The proposed system obtained accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, 95 %, 97 %, 90 % and 99.36 % respectively."
2017,Cantharidin Inhibits the Growth of Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Cells by Suppressing Autophagy and Inducing Apoptosis in Vitro and in Vivo,"Background/Aims: Cantharidin, a type of terpenoid secreted by the blister beetle Mylabris phalerata (Pallas), has attracted great attention in cancer therapy because of its potential anti-cancer activities. Here, we report the effects on apoptosis and autophagy in human triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines after treatment with cantharidin and attempt to elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Methods: MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells were treated with cantharidin and cell proliferation was examined using CCK-8 and clone formation assays. The expression of apoptosis- and autophagy-associated proteins was detected by western blotting. Cells were infected with lentivirus carrying the Beclin-1 gene, and MDA-MB-231-beclin1 (MB231-Bec) and MDA-MB-468-beclin-1(MB468-Bec) cells stably expressing Beclin-1 were established. Autophagic vacuoles in cells were observed with LC3 staining using fluorescence microscopy, and apoptotic cells were detected via flow cytometry. Tumor growth was assessed by subcutaneous inoculation of TNBC cells into BALB/c nude mice. Results: Cantharidin inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 cells, and induced cell apoptosis. Cantharidin additionally inhibited the conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II and autophagosome formation by suppressing the expression of Beclin-1. Furthermore, overexpression of Beclin-1 in TNBC cells attenuated the cytotoxicity of cantharidin. In vivo, cantharidin inhibited the growth of MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice by suppressing autophagy and inducing apoptosis, and Beclin-1 overexpression in TNBC cells reduced the efficacy of cantharidin. Conclusions: Cantharidin inhibits autophagy by suppressing Beclin-1 expression and inducing apoptosis of TNBC cells in vitro and in vivo, thereby representing a potential strategy for the treatment of TNBC."
2020,Breast Cancer Image Classification via Multi-Network Features and Dual-Network Orthogonal Low-Rank Learning,"Histopathological image analysis is an important technique for early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer in clinical practice. However, it has limited efficiency and thus the detection of breast cancer is still an open issue in medical image analysis. To improve the early diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer and reduce the workload of doctors, we devise a classification framework based on histology images by combining deep learning with machine learning methodologies in this paper. Specifically, we devise a multi-network feature extraction model by using pre-trained deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs), develop an effective feature dimension reduction method and train an ensemble support vector machine (E-SVM). First, we preprocess the histological images via scale transformation and color enhancement methods. Second, the multi-network features are extracted by using four pre-trained DCNNs (e.g., DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, multi-level InceptionV3, and multi-level VGG-16). Third, a feature selection method via dual-network orthogonal low-rank learning (DOLL) is further developed for performance boosting and overfitting alleviation. Finally, an E-SVM is trained via fused features and voting strategy to perform the classification task, which classifies the images into four classes (i.e., benign, in situ carcinomas, invasive carcinomas, and normal). We evaluate the proposed method on the public ICIAR 2018 Challenge dataset of histology images of breast cancer and achieve a high classification accuracy of 97.70%. Experimental results show that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform state-of-the-art methods."
2020,Localized fluorescent imaging of multiple proteins on individual extracellular vesicles using rolling circle amplification for cancer diagnosis,"Abstract Extracellular vesicles (EV) have attracted increasing attention as tumour biomarkers due to their unique biological property. However, conventional methods for EV analysis are mainly based on bulk measurements, which masks the EV‐to‐EV heterogeneity in tumour diagnosis and classification. Herein, a localized fluorescent imaging method (termed Digital Profiling of Proteins on Individual EV, DPPIE) was developed for analysis of multiple proteins on individual EV. In this assay, an anti‐CD9 antibody engineered biochip was used to capture EV from clinical plasma sample. Then the captured EV was specifically recognized by multiple DNA aptamers (CD63/EpCAM/MUC1), followed by rolling circle amplification to generate localized fluorescent signals. By‐analyzing the heterogeneity of individual EV, we found that the high‐dimensional data collected from each individual EV would provide more precise information than bulk measurement (ELISA) and the percent of CD63/EpCAM/MUC1‐triple‐positive EV in breast cancer patients was significantly higher than that of healthy donors, and this method can achieve an overall accuracy of 91%. Moreover, using DPPIE, we are able to distinguish the EV between lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous carcinoma patients. This individual EV heterogeneity analysis strategy provides a new way for digging more information on EV to achieve multi‐cancer diagnosis and classification."
2015,KNOWLEDGE AND ATTITUDE,"Reproductive health is concerned with the people’s ability to have a satisfyingand safe sex life ensuring their capability to reproduce with a liberty of making a decision that if,when and how often they have to do so. In Pakistan, culturally females are married at a youngage; become mothers and are at risk of health complications i.e. HIV/ STD and STI. There isless utilization of reproductive health services throughout Pakistan that ultimately affects healthstatus of people at very young age. Most of the communities are not aware of reproductivehealth services, thus not availing these facilities. Objective: So the present study was designedto examine the females perceptions, attitude and practices about reproductive health servicesas well as to determine the level of their empowerment to take decisions and make choicesregarding their own reproductive health besides determining the level of the quality, availabilityand accessibility of reproductive health services and to suggest some measures for policymakers to improve the reproductive health state of young mothers in district Faisalabad. StudyDesign: A sample of 600 young married females of age 15-32 years was selected throughmultistage sampling technique. Period: 2009. Setting: Rural and urban area of DistrictFaisalabad. Material and Method: Uni-variate (frequency distribution and percentage) and Bivariateanalysis (Chi square and Gamma Statistics) was carried out. Results: Most (44.0%) ofthe respondents belonged to age category of 26-30 years; 35.5% were married for 18 years;39.3% had been married for 5 years; 71.8% had primary and above level of education. Majority(65.9%) had up to Rs.10,000 per month income, 49.2% possessed 6-10 family members,73.5% had at least 2 and above live children. Majority had the knowledge of reproductive health(67.7%) and HIV/AIDs (54.7%) whereas most of females had no knowledge of STIs (69.8%),RTIs (52.3%) and its development (51.8%). Most of the females experienced headache (62.8%),swelling of different body parts (61%) and back pain (62.7%) during their reproductive life. Bivariateanalysis showed highly significant relation among age at marriage, number of children,cultural hindrance and age of respondents vs. their reproductive health. Conclusion: Althoughmost of the females were young & educated mothers with good reproductive health experiencebut still lacking in knowledge about STIs, HIV/AIDS, RTIs and breast cancer that is because ofcultural hindrance, early age marriage pattern and male dominancy which indicates that weneed to pay more attention towards female education and empowerment and decision makingauthority status at domestic level through community mobilization with the help of NGOs,Religious scholars and existing health system/ Health personnel’s .i.e. doctors/ nurses /LHV/FHW."
2017,Quantum Cascade Laser Spectral Histopathology: Breast Cancer Diagnostics Using High Throughput Chemical Imaging.,"Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) microscopy coupled with machine learning approaches has been demonstrated to be a powerful technique for identifying abnormalities in human tissue. The ability to objectively identify the prediseased state and diagnose cancer with high levels of accuracy has the potential to revolutionize current histopathological practice. Despite recent technological advances in FT-IR microscopy, sample throughput and speed of acquisition are key barriers to clinical translation. Wide-field quantum cascade laser (QCL) infrared imaging systems with large focal plane array detectors utilizing discrete frequency imaging have demonstrated that large tissue microarrays (TMA) can be imaged in a matter of minutes. However, this ground breaking technology is still in its infancy, and its applicability for routine disease diagnosis is, as yet, unproven. In light of this, we report on a large study utilizing a breast cancer TMA comprised of 207 different patients. We show that by using QCL imaging with continuous spectra acquired between 912 and 1800 cm-1, we can accurately differentiate between 4 different histological classes. We demonstrate that we can discriminate between malignant and nonmalignant stroma spectra with high sensitivity (93.56%) and specificity (85.64%) for an independent test set. Finally, we classify each core in the TMA and achieve high diagnostic accuracy on a patient basis with 100% sensitivity and 86.67% specificity. The absence of false negatives reported here opens up the possibility of utilizing high throughput chemical imaging for cancer screening, thereby reducing pathologist workload and improving patient care."
2021,Breast MRI for Evaluation of Response to Neoadjuvant Therapy.,"Neoadjuvant therapy is increasingly being used to treat early-stage triple-negative and human epidermal growth factor 2-overexpressing breast cancers, as well as locally advanced and inflammatory breast cancers. The rationales for neoadjuvant therapy are to shrink tumor size and potentially decrease the extent of surgery, to serve as an in vivo test of response to therapy, and to reveal prognostic information for the patient. MRI is the most accurate modality to demonstrate response to therapy and to help ensure accurate presurgical planning. Changes in lesion diameter, volume, and enhancement are used to predict complete response, partial response, or nonresponse to therapy. However, residual disease may be overestimated or underestimated at MRI. Fibrosis, necrotic tumors, and residual benign masses may be causes of overestimation of residual disease. Nonmass lesions, invasive lobular carcinoma, hormone receptor-positive tumors, nonconcentric shrinkage patterns, the use of antiangiogenic therapy, and late-enhancing foci may be causes of underestimation of residual disease. In patients with known axillary lymph node metastasis, neoadjuvant therapy may be followed by targeted axillary dissection to avoid the potential morbidity associated with an axillary lymph node dissection. Diffusion-weighted imaging, radiomics, machine learning, and deep learning methods are under investigation to improve MRI accuracy in predicting treatment response.©RSNA, 2021."
2021,Assessing Risk of Breast Cancer: A Review of Risk Prediction Models.,"Accurate and individualized breast cancer risk assessment can be used to guide personalized screening and prevention recommendations. Existing risk prediction models use genetic and nongenetic risk factors to provide an estimate of a woman's breast cancer risk and/or the likelihood that she has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Each model is best suited for specific clinical scenarios and may have limited applicability in certain types of patients. For example, the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool, which identifies women who would benefit from chemoprevention, is readily accessible and user-friendly but cannot be used in women under 35 years of age or those with prior breast cancer or lobular carcinoma in situ. Emerging research on deep learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) models suggests that mammographic images contain risk indicators that could be used to strengthen existing risk prediction models. This article reviews breast cancer risk factors, describes the appropriate use, strengths, and limitations of each risk prediction model, and discusses the emerging role of AI for risk assessment."
2022,An Augmented Artificial Intelligence Approach for Chronic Diseases Prediction,"Chronic diseases are increasing in prevalence and mortality worldwide. Early diagnosis has therefore become an important research area to enhance patient survival rates. Several research studies have reported classification approaches for specific disease prediction. In this paper, we propose a novel augmented artificial intelligence approach using an artificial neural network (ANN) with particle swarm optimization (PSO) to predict five prevalent chronic diseases including breast cancer, diabetes, heart attack, hepatitis, and kidney disease. Seven classification algorithms are compared to evaluate the proposed model's prediction performance. The ANN prediction model constructed with a PSO based feature extraction approach outperforms other state-of-the-art classification approaches when evaluated with accuracy. Our proposed approach gave the highest accuracy of 99.67%, with the PSO. However, the classification model's performance is found to depend on the attributes of data used for classification. Our results are compared with various chronic disease datasets and shown to outperform other benchmark approaches. In addition, our optimized ANN processing is shown to require less time compared to random forest (RF), deep learning and support vector machine (SVM) based methods. Our study could play a role for early diagnosis of chronic diseases in hospitals, including through development of online diagnosis systems."
2016,Joint Structural Estimation of Multiple Graphical Models,"Gaussian graphical models capture dependence relationships between random variables through the pattern of nonzero elements in the corresponding inverse covariance matrices. To date, there has been a large body of literature on both computational methods and analytical results on the estimation of a single graphical model. However, in many application domains, one has to estimate several related graphical models, a problem that has also received attention in the literature. The available approaches usually assume that all graphical models are globally related. On the other hand, in many settings different relationships between subsets of the node sets exist between different graphical models. We develop methodology that jointly estimates multiple Gaussian graphical models, assuming that there exists prior information on how they are structurally related. For many applications, such information is available from external data sources. The proposed method consists of first applying neighborhood selection with a group lasso penalty to obtain edge sets of the graphs, and a maximum likelihood refit for estimating the nonzero entries in the inverse covariance matrices. We establish consistency of the proposed method for sparse high-dimensional Gaussian graphical models and examine its performance using simulation experiments. Applications to a climate data set and a breast cancer data set are also discussed."
2014,Naive Bayes Classifiers: A Probabilistic Detection Model for Breast Cancer,"Naive Bayes is one of the most effective statistical and probabilistic classification algorithms. As health care environment is “information loaded” but “knowledge deprived”. So to extract knowledge, effective analysis tools are constructed to discover hidden relationships in data. The aim of this work is to design a Graphical User Interface to enter the patient screening record and detect the probability of having Breast cancer disease in women in her future using Naive Bayes Classifiers, a Probabilistic Classifier. As breast cancer is considered to be second leading cause of cancer deaths in women today so early detection can improve the survival rate of women. The prediction is performed from mining the patient’s historical data or data repository. Further from the experimental results it has been found that Naive Bayes Classifiers is providing improved accuracy with low computational effort and very high speed. The system has been implemented using java platform and trained using benchmark data from UCI machine learning repository. The system is expandable for the new dataset."
2023,Deep Learning for Automated Lesion Detection in Mammography,"Deep learning for automated lesion detection in mammography has gained widespread attention due to its potential to reduce the time needed for radiologists to detect lesions accurately. Deep learning models are now being widely used in automated lesion detection in digital mammography. These models are able to classify suspicious regions that refer to symptoms of breast cancer better than classical image processing techniques. However, traditional models are limited by the lack of large public datasets that are representative of the variety of lesions that can exist in mammograms. Recent works have proposed deep learning models trained on large public datasets such as Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and Digital Mammographic Image Archive (MI-AMI) that have achieved promising performance. These deep learning models use imaging and anatomical information for lesion detection, which results in better performance than classical approaches. Future research could extend the use of deep learning by exploring new vector-based approaches, integrating more data from mammography and clinic specialties, and performing holistic analyses to gain better insights.."
2023,Homogeneous Adaboost Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms with Reduced Entropy on Balanced Data,"Today’s world faces a serious public health problem with cancer. One type of cancer that begins in the breast and spreads to other body areas is breast cancer (BC). Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers that claim the lives of women. It is also becoming clearer that most cases of breast cancer are already advanced when they are brought to the doctor’s attention by the patient. The patient may have the evident lesion removed, but the seeds have reached an advanced stage of development or the body’s ability to resist them has weakened considerably, rendering them ineffective. Although it is still much more common in more developed nations, it is also quickly spreading to less developed countries. The motivation behind this study is to use an ensemble method for the prediction of BC, as an ensemble model aims to automatically manage the strengths and weaknesses of each of its separate models, resulting in the best decision being made overall. The main objective of this paper is to predict and classify breast cancer using Adaboost ensemble techniques. The weighted entropy is computed for the target column. Taking each attribute’s weights results in the weighted entropy. Each class’s likelihood is represented by the weights. The amount of information gained increases with a decrease in entropy. Both individual and homogeneous ensemble classifiers, created by mixing Adaboost with different single classifiers, have been used in this work. In order to deal with the class imbalance issue as well as noise, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) was used as part of the data mining pre-processing. The suggested approach uses a decision tree (DT) and naive Bayes (NB), with Adaboost ensemble techniques. The experimental findings shown 97.95% accuracy for prediction using the Adaboost-random forest classifier."
2022,Automated Breast Cancer Detection Models Based on Transfer Learning,"Breast cancer is among the leading causes of mortality for females across the planet. It is essential for the well-being of women to develop early detection and diagnosis techniques. In mammography, focus has contributed to the use of deep learning (DL) models, which have been utilized by radiologists to enhance the needed processes to overcome the shortcomings of human observers. The transfer learning method is being used to distinguish malignant and benign breast cancer by fine-tuning multiple pre-trained models. In this study, we introduce a framework focused on the principle of transfer learning. In addition, a mixture of augmentation strategies were used to prevent overfitting and produce stable outcomes by increasing the number of mammographic images; including several rotation combinations, scaling, and shifting. On the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) dataset, the proposed system was evaluated and achieved an accuracy of 89.5% using (residual network-50) ResNet50, and achieved an accuracy of 70% using the Nasnet-Mobile network. The proposed system demonstrated that pre-trained classification networks are significantly more effective and efficient, making them more acceptable for medical imaging, particularly for small training datasets."
2019,Multimorbidity in Stroke.,"The prevalence of long-term conditions is increasing across the world because of improved treatments for acute conditions and an increase in life expectancy. Importantly, people are now commonly living with multiple long-term conditions, and this has important implications for the design and cost of health services. Those with higher numbers of long-term conditions have worse health-related outcomes and use health services more frequently. The presence of multiple conditions adds complexity to disease management; for example, disease-disease and disease-drug interactions are more likely to occur. Co-occurring conditions can be concordant, that is, similar in origin and treatment requirements or discordant, that is, apparently unrelated or requiring different treatments. The terms multimorbidity and comorbidity are used frequently in the medical literature, the first commonly defined as the presence of ≥2 long-term conditions within an individual and the second as the presence of at least 1 long-term condition alongside an index condition. However, it is widely accepted that there is great variation in definitions and this makes comparison of populations difficult. A recent systematic review of systematic reviews examined definitions and methods of measurement of multimorbidity. The authors reported that multimorbidity is most commonly defined as the presence of ≥2 conditions within an individual, but there is variation in whether duration, severity, or clustering of conditions are considered. Various options for the measurement of multimorbidity, including weighted and unweighted options, were also examined, and the authors concluded that the optimum measure depends on the purpose of the study. So, at the present time, there remains no consensus on the optimal approach to measuring multimorbidity. Common measures include the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), Elixhauser Index, and the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. All are weighted measures, but Elixhauser can also be used in an unweighted form. The CCI was designed to predict mortality and includes 16 conditions (including cerebrovascular disease and hemiplegia). Elixhauser is a more extensive measure, it includes 30 acute and chronic conditions and was developed to predict length of hospital stay, hospital charges, and in-hospital death. The Cumulative Illness Rating Scale was developed to assess the medical burden of chronic illness; it includes 14 body system categories. By contrast, the Liu comorbidity index was specifically constructed from a cohort in Japan to be used in stroke outcomes research. It includes 41 conditions and is a weighted measure. When choosing a measure, a weighted one that has been validated for the outcome being considered may be best, but where evidence is weak or multiple outcomes are being examined, then a simple count of conditions may be appropriate. Importantly, a clear reason for choosing a definition and measure should be provided, and it may even be appropriate to include acute conditions, biopsychosocial factors, and risk factors in the measure if appropriate for the aim of the study. It is currently unclear what data source is best suited to the measurement of multimorbidity; for example, whether routinely collected or self-reported data are more helpful. Traditionally, routinely collected data has been considered to be more valid, but this relies on accurate coding by clinicians and risks missing conditions that are poorly coded such as depression or chronic pain. However, 1 risk with self-reported data is that it may omit conditions less visible to patients, such as chronic kidney disease. This article focuses on multimorbidity in stroke. Stroke survivors commonly have comorbid conditions, and these may arise due to a variety of biopsychosocial reasons. Many concomitant conditions may be concordant, that is, share risk factors and pathological disease processes with stroke, for example heart disease, or may predispose an individual to stroke, for example atrial fibrillation (AF). Other coexisting conditions may occur secondary to stroke, for example vascular dementia, or may be entirely unrelated or discordant, for example breast cancer. When measuring multimorbidity in stroke, how we define comorbidity will affect results; for example inclusion of conditions that are risk factors for stroke will make prevalence of comorbidity high. The recent Academy of Medical Sciences document makes it clear that even if someone only has a cluster of concordant conditions then the person should still be considered multimorbid. There are several reasons why multimorbidity in stroke merits attention. The additive effect of illness burdens from multiple conditions may contribute to poorer health status,"
2018,Breast Cancer Diagnosis by Different Machine Learning Methods Using Blood Analysis Data,"Today, one of the most common types of cancer is breast cancer. It is crucial to prevent the propagation of malign cells to reduce the rate of cancer induced mortality. Cancer detection must be done as early as possible for this purpose. Machine Learning techniques are used to diagnose or predict the success of treatment in medicine. In this study, four different machine learning algorithms were used to early detection of breast cancer. The aim of this study is to process the results of routine blood analysis with different ML methods and to understand how effective this method is for detection. Methods used can be listed as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), standard Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and K-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN). Dataset used were taken from UCI library. In this dataset age, body mass index (BMI), glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), leptin, adiponectin, resistin and chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1)   attributes were used. Parameters that have the best accuracy values were found by using four different Machine Learning techniques. For this purpose, hyperparameter optimization method was used. In the end, the results were compared and discussed."
2022,Deep learning model for fully automated breast cancer detection system from thermograms,"Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases among women worldwide. It is considered one of the leading causes of death among women. Therefore, early detection is necessary to save lives. Thermography imaging is an effective diagnostic technique which is used for breast cancer detection with the help of infrared technology. In this paper, we propose a fully automatic breast cancer detection system. First, U-Net network is used to automatically extract and isolate the breast area from the rest of the body which behaves as noise during the breast cancer detection model. Second, we propose a two-class deep learning model, which is trained from scratch for the classification of normal and abnormal breast tissues from thermal images. Also, it is used to extract more characteristics from the dataset that is helpful in training the network and improve the efficiency of the classification process. The proposed system is evaluated using real data (A benchmark, database (DMR-IR)) and achieved accuracy = 99.33%, sensitivity = 100% and specificity = 98.67%. The proposed system is expected to be a helpful tool for physicians in clinical use."
2020,Classification of Breast Cancer Histopathological Images Using Discriminative Patches Screened by Generative Adversarial Networks,"Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems of breast cancer histopathological images automated classification can help reduce the manual observation workload of pathologists. In the classification of breast cancer histopathology images, due to the small number and high-resolution of the training samples, the patch-based image classification methods have become very necessary. However, adopting a patches-based classification method is very challenging, since the patch-level datasets extracted from whole slide images (WSIs) contain many mislabeled patches. Existing patch-based classification methods have paid little attention to addressing the mislabeled patches for improving the performance of classification. To solve this problem, we propose a novel approach, named DenseNet121-AnoGAN, for classifying breast histopathological images into benign and malignant classes. The proposed approach consists of two major parts: using an unsupervised anomaly detection with generative adversarial networks (AnoGAN) to screen mislabeled patches and using densely connected convolutional network (DenseNet) to extract multi-layered features of the discriminative patches. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated on the publicly available BreaKHis dataset using 5-fold cross validation. The proposed DenseNet121-AnoGAN can be better suited to coarse-grained high-resolution images and achieved satisfactory classification performance in 40X and 100X images. The best accuracy of 99.13% and the best $F1_{score}$ of 99.38% have been obtained at the image level for the 40X magnification factor. We have also investigated the performance of AnoGAN on the other classification networks, including AlexNet, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50. Our experiments show that whether it is at the patient-level accuracy or at the image-level accuracy, the classification networks with AnoGAN have provided better performance than the classification networks without AnoGAN."
2016,Comparative study of relevance vector machine with various machine learning techniques used for detecting breast cancer,"Now-a-days breast cancer has become one of the leading cause of cancer death among women. This cancer is caused mostly due to the lifestyle changes, avoiding breast feeding etc. Detecting breast cancer takes long time due to manual diagnosis. Even though there are many diagnostic systems are available still, it takes more time for proper classification. For detecting breast cancer, mostly machine learning techniques are used. This work deals with the comparative study of Relevance vector machine(RVM) which provides Low computational cost while comparing with other machine learning techniques which are used for breast cancer detection. The aim of this work is to compare and explain how RVM is better than other machine learning algorithms for diagnosing breast cancer even the variables are reduced."
2022,Breast Tumour Classification Using Ultrasound Elastography with Machine Learning: A Systematic Scoping Review,"Simple Summary Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women globally. Early and accurate screening of breast tumours can improve survival. Ultrasound elastography is a non-invasive and non-ionizing imaging approach to characterize lesions for breast cancer screening, while machine learning techniques could improve the accuracy and reliability of computer-aided diagnosis. This review focuses on the state-of-the-art development and application of the machine learning model in breast tumour classification. Abstract Ultrasound elastography can quantify stiffness distribution of tissue lesions and complements conventional B-mode ultrasound for breast cancer screening. Recently, the development of computer-aided diagnosis has improved the reliability of the system, whilst the inception of machine learning, such as deep learning, has further extended its power by facilitating automated segmentation and tumour classification. The objective of this review was to summarize application of the machine learning model to ultrasound elastography systems for breast tumour classification. Review databases included PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, and EMBASE. Thirteen (n = 13) articles were eligible for review. Shear-wave elastography was investigated in six articles, whereas seven studies focused on strain elastography (5 freehand and 2 Acoustic Radiation Force). Traditional computer vision workflow was common in strain elastography with separated image segmentation, feature extraction, and classifier functions using different algorithm-based methods, neural networks or support vector machines (SVM). Shear-wave elastography often adopts the deep learning model, convolutional neural network (CNN), that integrates functional tasks. All of the reviewed articles achieved sensitivity ≥80%, while only half of them attained acceptable specificity ≥95%. Deep learning models did not necessarily perform better than traditional computer vision workflow. Nevertheless, there were inconsistencies and insufficiencies in reporting and calculation, such as the testing dataset, cross-validation, and methods to avoid overfitting. Most of the studies did not report loss or hyperparameters. Future studies may consider using the deep network with an attention layer to locate the targeted object automatically and online training to facilitate efficient re-training for sequential data."
2018,A resolution adaptive deep hierarchical (RADHicaL) learning scheme applied to nuclear segmentation of digital pathology images,"Deep learning (DL) has recently been successfully applied to a number of image analysis problems. However, DL approaches tend to be inefficient for segmentation on large image data, such as high-resolution digital pathology slide images. For example, typical breast biopsy images scanned at 40 magnification contain billions of pixels, of which usually only a small percentage belong to the class of interest. For a typical naïve deep learning scheme, parsing through and interrogating all the image pixels would represent hundreds if not thousands of hours of compute time using high performance computing environments. In this paper, we present a resolution adaptive deep hierarchical (RADHicaL) learning scheme wherein DL networks at lower resolutions are leveraged to determine if higher levels of magnification, and thus computation, are necessary to provide precise results. We evaluate our approach on a nuclear segmentation task with a cohort of 141 ER+ breast cancer images and show we can reduce computation time on average by about 85%. Expert annotations of 12,000 nuclei across these 141 images were employed for quantitative evaluation of RADHicaL. A head-to-head comparison with a naïve DL approach, operating solely at the highest magnification, yielded the following performance metrics: .9407 vs .9854 Detection Rate, .8218 vs .8489 F-score, .8061 vs .8364 true positive rate and .8822 vs 0.8932 positive predictive value. Our performance indices compare favourably with state of the art nuclear segmentation approaches for digital pathology images."
2019,Automatic Identification of Breast Ultrasound Image Based on Supervised Block-Based Region Segmentation Algorithm and Features Combination Migration Deep Learning Model,"Breast cancer is a high-incidence type of cancer for women. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in the successful treatment of the disease and the effective reduction of deaths. In this paper, deep learning technology combined with ultrasound imaging diagnosis was used to identify and determine whether the tumors were benign or malignant. First, the tumor regions were segmented from the breast ultrasound (BUS) images using the supervised block-based region segmentation algorithm. Then, a VGG-19 network pretrained on the ImageNet dataset was applied to the segmented BUS images to predict whether the breast tumor was benign or malignant. The benchmark data for bio-validation were obtained from 141 patients with 199 breast tumors, including 69 cases of malignancy and 130 cases of benign tumors. The experiment showed that the accuracy of the supervised block-based region segmentation algorithm was almost the same as that of manual segmentation; therefore, it can replace manual work. The diagnostic effect of the combination feature model established based on the depth feature of the B-mode ultrasonic imaging and strain elastography was better than that of the model established based on these two images alone. The correct recognition rate was 92.95%, and the AUC was 0.98 for the combination feature model."
2017,A deep learning based strategy for identifying and associating mitotic activity with gene expression derived risk categories in estrogen receptor positive breast cancers,"The treatment and management of early stage estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer is hindered by the difficulty in identifying patients who require adjuvant chemotherapy in contrast to those that will respond to hormonal therapy. To distinguish between the more and less aggressive breast tumors, which is a fundamental criterion for the selection of an appropriate treatment plan, Oncotype DX (ODX) and other gene expression tests are typically employed. While informative, these gene expression tests are expensive, tissue destructive, and require specialized facilities. Bloom‐Richardson (BR) grade, the common scheme employed in breast cancer grading, has been shown to be correlated with the Oncotype DX risk score. Unfortunately, studies have also shown that the BR grade determined experiences notable inter‐observer variability. One of the constituent categories in BR grading is the mitotic index. The goal of this study was to develop a deep learning (DL) classifier to identify mitotic figures from whole slides images of ER+ breast cancer, the hypothesis being that the number of mitoses identified by the DL classifier would correlate with the corresponding Oncotype DX risk categories. The mitosis detector yielded an average F‐score of 0.556 in the AMIDA mitosis dataset using a 6‐fold validation setup. For a cohort of 174 whole slide images with early stage ER+ breast cancer for which the corresponding Oncotype DX score was available, the distributions of the number of mitoses identified by the DL classifier was found to be significantly different between the high vs low Oncotype DX risk groups (P < 0.01). Comparisons of other risk groups, using both ODX score and histological grade, were also found to present significantly different automated mitoses distributions. Additionally, a support vector machine classifier trained to separate low/high Oncotype DX risk categories using the mitotic count determined by the DL classifier yielded a 83.19% classification accuracy. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry"
2019,Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation vs. Classification in Computational Pathology: Application to Mitosis Analysis in Breast Cancer Grading,"Existing computational approaches have not yet resulted in effective and efficient computer-aided tools that are used in pathologists' daily practice. Focusing on a computer-based qualification for breast cancer diagnosis, the present study proposes two deep learning architectures to efficiently and effectively detect and classify mitosis in a histopathological tissue sample. The first method consists of two parts, entailing a preprocessing of the digital histological image and a free-handcrafted-feature Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) used for binary classification. Results show that the methodology proposed can achieve 95% accuracy in testing, with an F1-score of 94.35%. This result is higher than the results using classical image processing techniques and also higher than the approaches combining CCNs with handcrafted features. The second approach is an end-to-end methodology using semantic segmentation. Results showed that this algorithm can achieve an accuracy higher than 95% in testing and an average Dice index of 0.6, higher than the existing results using CNNs (0.9 F1-score). Additionally, due to the semantic properties of the deep learning approach, an end-to-end deep learning framework is viable to perform both tasks: detection and classification of mitosis. The results show the potential of deep learning in the analysis of Whole Slide Images (WSI) and its integration to computer-aided systems. The extension of this work to whole slide images is also addressed in the last sections; as well as, some computational key points that are useful when constructing a computer-aided-system inspired by the proposed technology."
2021,Stand-Alone Use of Artificial Intelligence for Digital Mammography and Digital Breast Tomosynthesis Screening: A Retrospective Evaluation.,"Background Use of artificial intelligence (AI) as a stand-alone reader for digital mammography (DM) or digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) breast screening could ease radiologists' workload while maintaining quality. Purpose To retrospectively evaluate the stand-alone performance of an AI system as an independent reader of DM and DBT screening examinations. Materials and Methods Consecutive screening-paired and independently read DM and DBT images acquired between January 2015 and December 2016 were retrospectively collected from the Tomosynthesis Cordoba Screening Trial. An AI system computed a cancer risk score (range, 1-100) for DM and DBT examinations independently. AI stand-alone performance was measured using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity and recall rate at different operating points selected to have noninferior sensitivity compared with the human readings (noninferiority margin, 5%). The recall rate of AI and the human readings were compared using a McNemar test. Results A total of 15 999 DM and DBT examinations (113 breast cancers, including 98 screen-detected and 15 interval cancers) from 15 998 women (mean age, 58 years ± 6 [standard deviation]) were evaluated. AI achieved an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.96) for DM and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.91, 0.97) for DBT. For DM, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (58.4%; 66 of 113; 95% CI: 49.2, 67.1) or double (67.3%; 76 of 113; 95% CI: 58.2, 75.2) reader, with a reduction in recall rate (P < .001) of up to 2% (95% CI: -2.4, -1.6). For DBT, AI achieved noninferior sensitivity as a single (77%; 87 of 113; 95% CI: 68.4, 83.8) or double (81.4%; 92 of 113; 95% CI: 73.3, 87.5) reader, but with a higher recall rate (P < .001) of up to 12.3% (95% CI: 11.7, 12.9). Conclusion Artificial intelligence could replace radiologists' readings in breast screening, achieving a noninferior sensitivity, with a lower recall rate for digital mammography but a higher recall rate for digital breast tomosynthesis. © RSNA, 2021 See also the editorial by Fuchsjäger and Adelsmayr in this issue."
2020,MGNN: A Multimodal Graph Neural Network for Predicting the Survival of Cancer Patients,"Predicting the survival of cancer patients holds significant meaning for public health, and has attracted increasing attention in medical information communities. In this study, we propose a novel framework for cancer survival prediction named Multimodal Graph Neural Network (MGNN), which explores the features of real-world multimodual data such as gene expression, copy number alteration and clinical data in a unified framework. In order to explore the inherent relation, we first construct the bipartite graphs between patients and multimodal data. Subsequently, graph neural network is adopted to obtain the embedding of each patient on different bipartite graphs. Finally, a multimodal fusion neural layer is designed to fuse the features from different modal data. The output of our method is the classification of short term survival or long term survival for each patient. Experimental results on one breast cancer dataset demonstrate that MGNN outperforms all baselines. Furthermore, we test the trained model on lung cancer dataset, and the experimental results verify the strong robust by comparing with state-of-the-art methods."
2016,Silibinin-Induced Apoptosis and Downregulation of MicroRNA-21 and MicroRNA-155 in MCF-7 Human Breast Cancer Cells,"Purpose MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have received much attention owing to their aberrant expression in various stages of cancer. In many biological processes, miRNAs negatively regulate gene expression, and may be useful in therapeutic strategies. The present study evaluated the effects of silibinin (silybin), a natural flavonoid, on miRNA expression and attempted to elucidate therapeutic targets in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Methods The rates of cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined in silibinin-treated and untreated MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, the expression levels of miR-21 and miR-155 were measured in MCF-7 cells after incubation with silibinin (100 µg/mL), and the putative targets of the miRNAs within the apoptotic pathways were predicted using bioinformatic approaches. The expression levels of some of these targets were evaluated by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Results Silibinin induced apoptosis in MCF-7 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. qRT-PCR analysis revealed a decrease in miR-21 and miR-155 expression levels in silibinin-treated cells relative to the levels in the untreated cells. Potential miR-21 and miR-155 targets within the apoptotic pathways, such as CASP-9, BID, APAF-1, CASP-3, CASP-8, and PDCD4, were predicted by in silico analysis. qRT-PCR analysis showed upregulation of some of these potential targets including caspase-9 (CASP-9) and BID after silibinin treatment for 48 hours. Conclusion Our results suggest a correlation between the expression of miR-21 and miR-155, and MCF-7 cell proliferation. The antiproliferative activity of silibinin may partly be attributable to the downregulation of miR-21 and miR-155, and the upregulation of their apoptotic targets. Furthermore, the upregulation of CASP-9 and BID indicates that silibinin induces apoptosis through both the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways."
2014,Diagnosis of Breast Masses from Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced and Diffusion-Weighted MR: A Machine Learning Approach,"Purpose Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is increasingly used for breast cancer diagnosis as supplementary to conventional imaging techniques. Combining of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) of morphology and kinetic features from DCE-MRI to improve the discrimination power of malignant from benign breast masses is rarely reported. Materials and Methods The study comprised of 234 female patients with 85 benign and 149 malignant lesions. Four distinct groups of features, coupling with pathological tests, were estimated to comprehensively characterize the pictorial properties of each lesion, which was obtained by a semi-automated segmentation method. Classical machine learning scheme including feature subset selection and various classification schemes were employed to build prognostic model, which served as a foundation for evaluating the combined effects of the multi-sided features for predicting of the types of lesions. Various measurements including cross validation and receiver operating characteristics were used to quantify the diagnostic performances of each feature as well as their combination. Results Seven features were all found to be statistically different between the malignant and the benign groups and their combination has achieved the highest classification accuracy. The seven features include one pathological variable of age, one morphological variable of slope, three texture features of entropy, inverse difference and information correlation, one kinetic feature of SER and one DWI feature of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Together with the selected diagnostic features, various classical classification schemes were used to test their discrimination power through cross validation scheme. The averaged measurements of sensitivity, specificity, AUC and accuracy are 0.85, 0.89, 90.9% and 0.93, respectively. Conclusion Multi-sided variables which characterize the morphological, kinetic, pathological properties and DWI measurement of ADC can dramatically improve the discriminatory power of breast lesions."
2020,Multi-Modal Classification for Human Breast Cancer Prognosis Prediction: Proposal of Deep-Learning Based Stacked Ensemble Model,"Breast Cancer is a highly aggressive type of cancer generally formed in the cells of the breast. Despite significant advances in the treatment of primary breast cancer in the last decade, there is a dire need to attempt of an accurate predictive model for breast cancer prognosis prediction. Researchers from various disciplines are working together to develop methods to save people from this fatal disease. A good predictive model can help in correct prognosis prediction of breast cancer. This accurate prediction can have several benefits like detection of cancer in the early stage, spare patients from getting unnecessary treatment and medical expenses related to it. Previous works rely mostly on uni-modal data (selected gene expression)for predictive model design. In recent years, however, multi-modal cancer data sets have become available (gene expression, copy number alteration and clinical). Motivated by the enhancement of deep-learning based models, in the current study, we propose to use some deep-learning based predictive models in a stacked ensemble framework to improve the prognosis prediction of breast cancer from available multi-modal data sets. One of the unique advantages of the proposed approach lies in the architecture of the model. It is a two-stage model. Stage one uses a convolutional neural network for feature extraction, while stage two uses the extracted features as input to the stack-based ensemble model. The predictive performance evaluated using different performance measures shows that this model produces better result than already existing approaches. This model results in AUC value of 0.93 and accuracy of 90.2 percent at medium stringency level (Specificity = 95 percent and threshold = 0.45). Keras 2.2.1, along with Tensorflow 1.12, is used for implementing the source code of the model. The source code can be downloaded from Github: https://github.com/nikhilaryan92/BreastCancer."
2020,Fast and powerful conditional randomization testing via distillation.,"We consider the problem of conditional independence testing: given a response Y and covariates (X,Z), we test the null hypothesis that Y⫫X∣Z. The conditional randomization test was recently proposed as a way to use distributional information about X∣Z to exactly and nonasymptotically control Type-I error using any test statistic in any dimensionality without assuming anything about Y∣(X,Z). This flexibility, in principle, allows one to derive powerful test statistics from complex prediction algorithms while maintaining statistical validity. Yet the direct use of such advanced test statistics in the conditional randomization test is prohibitively computationally expensive, especially with multiple testing, due to the requirement to recompute the test statistic many times on resampled data. We propose the distilled conditional randomization test, a novel approach to using state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms in the conditional randomization test while drastically reducing the number of times those algorithms need to be run, thereby taking advantage of their power and the conditional randomization test's statistical guarantees without suffering the usual computational expense. In addition to distillation, we propose a number of other tricks, like screening and recycling computations, to further speed up the conditional randomization test without sacrificing its high power and exact validity. Indeed, we show in simulations that all our proposals combined lead to a test that has similar power to the most powerful existing conditional randomization test implementations, but requires orders of magnitude less computation, making it a practical tool even for large datasets. We demonstrate these benefits on a breast cancer dataset by identifying biomarkers related to cancer stage."
2018,Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Deep Learning Algorithm,"The cancer is the most dangerous diseases in the world, its mainly effective for women. So, our prime target must be curing the cancer through scientific investigation and the second main target should be early detection of cancer because the early detection of cancer can be helpful for remove the cancer completed. After reviewed 41 papers we found that several techniques are available for cancer detection. In this paperwe proposedDeep Leaning algorithm neural network for diagnosed breast cancer using Wisconsin Breast Cancer database. The paper shows how we can use deep learning technology for diagnosis breast cancer using UCI Dataset. Because deep learning techniques almost used for high task objective Computer Vision, Image processing, Medical Diagnosis, Neural Language Processing. But in this paper, we are applying deep learning technology on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Database and we have seen that is very beneficial for us for diagnosis breast cancer with accuracy 99.67%. This paper is divided in three parts first we have collect dataset and applied pre-processing algorithm for scaled and filter data then we have split dataset in training and testing purpose and generate some graph for visualization data. In last implement model on training dataset and achieved accuracy 99.67%. So, we have seen deep learning technology is a good way for diagnosis breast cancer with Wisconsin Breast Dataset. This database provides 569 rows and 30 features in the dataset. In this paper we have used 11 features for diagnosis breast cancer that we have got after pre-processing. But before train model we have applied some pre-processing algorithm like Label Encoder, Normalizerand StandardScalerfor scaled dataset then applied model and achieved accuracy. In this paper we also compare deep learning algorithm with other machine learning and seen our proposed system is proved best from others machine learning algorithm."
2021,Antioxidants for the Treatment of Breast Cancer: Are We There Yet?,"Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer and the leading cause of cancer death in women. Oxidative stress and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been related to cancer progression. Compared to their normal counterparts, tumor cells show higher ROS levels and tight regulation of REDOX homeostasis to maintain a low degree of oxidative stress. Traditionally antioxidants have been extensively investigated to counteract breast carcinogenesis and tumor progression as chemopreventive agents; however, there is growing evidence indicating their potential as adjuvants for the treatment of breast cancer. Aimed to elucidate whether antioxidants could be a reality in the management of breast cancer patients, this review focuses on the latest investigations regarding the ambivalent role of antioxidants in the development of breast cancer, with special attention to the results derived from clinical trials, as well as their potential use as plausible agents in combination therapy and their power to ameliorate the side effects attributed to standard therapeutics. Data retrieved herein suggest that antioxidants play an important role in breast cancer prevention and the improvement of therapeutic efficacy; nevertheless, appropriate patient stratification based on “redoxidomics” or tumor subtype is mandatory in order to define the dosage for future standardized and personalized treatments of patients."
2019,Photoacoustic Image Classification and Segmentation of Breast Cancer: A Feasibility Study,"Nowadays, breast cancer has increasingly threatened the health of human, especially females. However, breast cancer is still hard to detect in the early stage, and the diagnostic procedure can be time-consuming with abundant expertise needed. In this paper, we explored the deep learning algorithms in emerging photoacoustic tomography for breast cancer diagnostics. Specifically, we used a pre-processing algorithm to enhance the quality and uniformity of input breast cancer images and a transfer learning method to achieve better classification performance. Besides, by comparing the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity of support vector machine with AlexNet and GoogLeNet, it can be concluded that the combination of deep learning and photoacoustic imaging has the potential to achieve important impact on clinical diagnostics. Finally, according to the breast imaging reporting and data-system levels, we divided breast cancer images into six grades and designed a segmentation software for identifying the six grades of breast cancer. Then, we tested based on MAMMOGRAPHYC IMAGES DATABASE FROM LAPIMO EESC/USP (Laboratory of Analysis and Processing of Medical and Dental Images) to verify the accuracy of our segmentation method, which showed a satisfactory result."
2020,Quality of life and psychological functioning in postmenopausal women undergoing aromatase inhibitor treatment for early breast cancer,"Introduction Aromatase inhibitors (AIs) dramatically increased breast cancer (BC) survival, leading to enhanced attention to their long-term consequences on psychological functioning. Conflicting data has been examined regarding the association between AIs administration and the clinical psychological features in BC survivors (BCSs). Purpose As psychological symptoms often occur in such chronic diseases, our study aimed at exploring anxious and depressive symptoms and the perceived quality of life (QoL) in BCSs assessed for osteoporosis. Methods The total sample consisted of a clinical sample of 51 outpatient postmenopausal women, diagnosed with BC, and a control group composed of 51 healthy postmenopausal women. All recruited participants were evaluated through the clinical gold standard interview and completed the following self-rating scales: the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, Beck Depression Inventory II edition, and 36-Item Short Form Health Survey, which were administered at baseline and after 6 months in BCSs in AIs treatment, compared with controls. Moreover, all participants were assessed for vitamin D status, bone mineral density (BMD) and subclinical vertebral fractures. Data regarding age, age at menopause, body mass index (BMI), smoking habits and alcohol consumption was collected. Results BCSs (n = 51) showed higher anxious and depressive symptoms, and lower perceived QoL vs. controls (n = 51) (p<0.05 for all). After 6 months of treatment with AIs, BCSs showed significant reduction of anxious and depressive symptoms and a significantly higher perceived QoL for both physical and mental components, vs. controls. Conclusions The improvement of clinical psychological features and perceived QoL was associated with AIs treatment in women being treated with, for early breast cancer. Further studies are needed to obtain a deeper comprehension of the correlation between clinical psychological and physical features in BCSs."
2014,Experiences of breast cancer survivors participating in a tailored exercise intervention -a qualitative study.,"AIM The aim of the study was to investigate how tailored exercise is experienced by cancer survivors. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-five breast cancer survivors who were recently treated with systemic adjuvant treatments attended tailored exercise classes as a part of a randomized controlled exercise intervention study (Breast Cancer and Exercise, BREX). Focus group discussions with a median of four (range 3-6) participants in each group were conducted to capture their individual experiences of their course of illness, taking part in the exercise trial, the personal meaning of tailored exercise classes and the group. RESULTS Attending the intervention in which the focus of attention was on physical rehabilitation was highly valued, since the participants experienced both improved physical fitness and improved coping. Due to altered physical appearance and poor physical fitness, the participants felt that tailored exercise for patients with breast cancer reduced their barrier to start exercising. Peer support from the group was valued, especially that of sharing experiences, receiving psychological support and gaining a sense of normality. A sense of mastery over their disease through participating in the intervention, i.e. better psychological functioning and improved mood, was a consequence of better physical fitness and of meeting other breast cancer survivors. Also participating in the study per se increases a sense of comfort and security with extra medical examinations and follow-up. CONCLUSION Participating in the tailored exercise group for breast cancer survivors helped patients gain a sense of mastery, restoring their self-esteem and constructing a meaning for their cancer experience and its impact on their lives."
2021,Breast cancer histopathological image classification using attention high‐order deep network,"Computer‐aided classification of pathological images is of the great significance for breast cancer diagnosis. In recent years, deep learning methods for breast cancer pathological image classification have made breakthrough progress, becoming the mainstream in this field. To capture more discriminant deep features for breast cancer pathological images, this work introduces a novel attention high‐order deep network (AHoNet) by simultaneously embedding attention mechanism and high‐order statistical representation into a residual convolutional network. AHoNet firstly employs an efficient channel attention module with non‐dimensionality reduction and local cross‐channel interaction to achieve local salient deep features of breast cancer pathological images. Then, their second‐order covariance statistics are further estimated through matrix power normalization, which provides a more robust global feature presentation of breast cancer pathological images. We extensively evaluate AHoNet on the public BreakHis and BACH breast cancer pathology datasets. Experimental results illustrate that AHoNet gains the optimal patient‐level classification accuracies of 99.29% and 85% on the BreakHis and BACH database, respectively, demonstrating the competitive performance with state‐of‐the‐art single models on this medical image application."
2014,Randomized controlled trial of a cognitive-behavioral therapy plus hypnosis intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer.,"PURPOSE The objective of this study was to test the efficacy of cognitive-behavioral therapy plus hypnosis (CBTH) to control fatigue in patients with breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy. We hypothesized that patients in the CBTH group receiving radiotherapy would have lower levels of fatigue than patients in an attention control group. PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients (n = 200) were randomly assigned to either the CBTH (n = 100; mean age, 55.59 years) or attention control (n = 100; mean age, 55.97 years) group. Fatigue was measured at four time points (baseline, end of radiotherapy, 4 weeks, and 6 months after radiotherapy). Fatigue was measured using the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT) -Fatigue subscale and Visual Analog Scales (VASs; Fatigue and Muscle Weakness). RESULTS The CBTH group had significantly lower levels of fatigue (FACIT) at the end of radiotherapy (z, 6.73; P < .001), 4-week follow-up (z, 6.98; P < .001), and 6-month follow-up (z, 7.99; P < .001) assessments. Fatigue VAS scores were significantly lower in the CBTH group at the end of treatment (z, 5.81; P < .001) and at the 6-month follow-up (z, 4.56; P < .001), but not at the 4-week follow-up (P < .07). Muscle Weakness VAS scores were significantly lower in the CBTH group at the end of treatment (z, 9.30; P < .001) and at the 6-month follow-up (z, 3.10; P < .02), but not at the 4-week follow-up (P < .13). CONCLUSION The results support CBTH as an evidence-based intervention to control fatigue in patients undergoing radiotherapy for breast cancer. CBTH is noninvasive, has no adverse effects, and its beneficial effects persist long after the last intervention session. CBTH seems to be a candidate for future dissemination and implementation."
2023,Vision-Transformer-Based Transfer Learning for Mammogram Classification,"Breast mass identification is a crucial procedure during mammogram-based early breast cancer diagnosis. However, it is difficult to determine whether a breast lump is benign or cancerous at early stages. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been used to solve this problem and have provided useful advancements. However, CNNs focus only on a certain portion of the mammogram while ignoring the remaining and present computational complexity because of multiple convolutions. Recently, vision transformers have been developed as a technique to overcome such limitations of CNNs, ensuring better or comparable performance in natural image classification. However, the utility of this technique has not been thoroughly investigated in the medical image domain. In this study, we developed a transfer learning technique based on vision transformers to classify breast mass mammograms. The area under the receiver operating curve of the new model was estimated as 1 ± 0, thus outperforming the CNN-based transfer-learning models and vision transformer models trained from scratch. The technique can, hence, be applied in a clinical setting, to improve the early diagnosis of breast cancer."
2015,Comparative studies on breast cancer classifications with k-fold cross validations using machine learning techniques,"In the past years there are several machine learning techniques have been proposed to design precise classification systems for several medical issues. This paper compares and analyses breast cancer classifications with different machine learning algorithms using k-Fold Cross Validation (KCV) technique. Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Neural Network and Support Vector Machine algorithm with three different kernel functions are used as classifier to classify original and prognostic Wisconsin breast cancer. The comparative analysis of the studies are focusing on the impact of k in k-fold cross validation and achieve higher accuracy. We have used the benchmarking dataset in UCI in the experiments. In theory the common choice is to select k=10 for KCV. However this comes at an increased computational cost whereby the more the folds the more models you need to train. The overall results showed important conclusion; we cannot always expect to have more accurate result by having greater value of k in k-fold cross validation."
2017,Analysis and prediction of breast cancer and diabetes disease datasets using data mining classification techniques,"Data mining is a technique to extracts some meaningful information from large amount of data. Nowadays In healthcare sector data mining is come out important field from all the fields for providing accurate prediction of diseases and deeper study of medical data. Authors are using different data mining techniques to identification of various diseases such as stoke, diabetes, cancer, hypothyroid and heart disease etc. This paper discussed the literature study of various data mining techniques in section two. In this paper, we used two disease dataset breast cancer and diabetes dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. We classified the five classification algorithms on WEKA Explorer and WEKA Experimenter interface. WEKA tool is a good classification tool used in this paper. Naïve bayes, SMO, REP Tree, J48 and MLP algorithms are used to classify breast cancer and diabetes dataset on WEKA interface. The performances of these five algorithms have been analyzed on breast cancer and diabetes dataset using training data testing mode. After analyzing the performances of all algorithm, found that naïve bayes gives 72.70%accuracy on breast cancer dataset and SMO gives 76.80%accuracy on diabetes dataset."
2015,Au-Ag@Au Hollow Nanostructure with Enhanced Chemical Stability and Improved Photothermal Transduction Efficiency for Cancer Treatment.,"Despite the fact that Au-Ag hollow nanoparticles (HNPs) have gained much attention as ablation agents for photothermal therapy, the instability of the Ag element limits their applications. Herein, excess Au atoms were deposited on the surface of a Au-Ag HNP by improving the reduction power of l-ascorbic acid (AA) and thereby preventing the reaction between HAuCl4 and the Ag element in the Au-Ag alloy nanostructure. Significantly, the obtained Au-Ag@Au HNPs show excellent chemical stability in an oxidative environment, together with remarkable increase in extinction peak intensity and obvious narrowing in peak width. Moreover, finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) was used to simulate the optical properties and electric field distribution of HNPs. The calculated results show that the proportion of absorption cross section in total extinction cross section increases with the improvement of Au content in HNP. As predicted by the theoretical calculation results, Au-Ag@Au nanocages (NCs) exhibit a photothermal transduction efficiency (η) as high as 36.5% at 808 nm, which is higher than that of Au-Ag NCs (31.2%). Irradiated by 808 nm laser at power densities of 1 W/cm(2), MCF-7 breast cancer cells incubated with PEGylated Au-Ag@Au NCs were seriously destroyed. Combined together, Au-Ag@Au HNPs with enhanced chemical stability and improved photothermal transduction efficiency show superior competitiveness as photothermal agents."
2018,Mechanistic evaluation of phytochemicals in breast cancer remedy: current understanding and future perspectives,"Breast cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancers around the globe and accounts for a large proportion of fatalities in women. Despite the advancement in therapeutic and diagnostic procedures, breast cancer still represents a major challenge. Current anti-breast cancer approaches include surgical removal, radiotherapy, hormonal therapy and the use of various chemotherapeutic drugs. However, drug resistance, associated serious adverse effects, metastasis and recurrence complications still need to be resolved which demand safe and alternative strategies. In this scenario, phytochemicals have recently gained huge attention due to their safety profile and cost-effectiveness. These phytochemicals modulate various genes, gene products and signalling pathways, thereby inhibiting breast cancer cell proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and metastasis and inducing apoptosis. Moreover, they also target breast cancer stem cells and overcome drug resistance problems in breast carcinomas. Phytochemicals as adjuvants with chemotherapeutic drugs have greatly enhanced their therapeutic efficacy. This review focuses on the recently recognized molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer chemoprevention with the use of phytochemicals such as curcumin, resveratrol, silibinin, genistein, epigallocatechin gallate, secoisolariciresinol, thymoquinone, kaempferol, quercetin, parthenolide, sulforaphane, ginsenosides, naringenin, isoliquiritigenin, luteolin, benzyl isothiocyanate, α-mangostin, 3,3′-diindolylmethane, pterostilbene, vinca alkaloids and apigenin."
2014,A Novel Small Molecule Aurora Kinase Inhibitor Attenuates Breast Tumor–Initiating Cells and Overcomes Drug Resistance,"Chemoresistance is a major cause of cancer treatment failure. Tumor-initiating cells (TIC) have attracted a considerable amount of attention due to their role in chemoresistance and tumor recurrence. Here, we evaluated the small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitor AKI603 as a novel agent against TICs in breast cancer. AKI603 significantly inhibited Aurora-A (AurA) kinase and induced cell-cycle arrest. In addition, the intragastric administration of AKI603 reduced xenograft tumor growth. Interestingly, we found that breast cancer cells that were resistant to epirubicin expressed a high level of activated AurA and also have a high CD24Low/CD44High TIC population. The inhibition of AurA kinase by AKI603 abolished the epirubicin-induced enrichment of TICs. Moreover, AKI603 suppressed the capacity of cells to form mammosphere and also suppressed the expression of self-renewal genes (β-catenin, c-Myc, Sox2, and Oct4). Thus, our work suggests the potential clinical use of the small molecule Aurora kinase inhibitor AKI603 to overcome drug resistance induced by conventional chemotherapeutics in breast cancer.

2020,Optimised genetic algorithm-extreme learning machine approach for automatic COVID-19 detection,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19), is an ongoing global pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. Chest Computed Tomography (CT) is an effective method for detecting lung illnesses, including COVID-19. However, the CT scan is expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, this work focus on detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images because it is widely available, faster, and cheaper than CT scan. Many machine learning approaches such as Deep Learning, Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine; have used X-ray for detecting the COVID-19. Although the performance of those approaches is acceptable in terms of accuracy, however, they require high computational time and more memory space. Therefore, this work employs an Optimised Genetic Algorithm-Extreme Learning Machine (OGA-ELM) with three selection criteria (i.e., random, K-tournament, and roulette wheel) to detect COVID-19 using X-ray images. The most crucial strength factors of the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) are: (i) high capability of the ELM in avoiding overfitting; (ii) its usability on binary and multi-type classifiers; and (iii) ELM could work as a kernel-based support vector machine with a structure of a neural network. These advantages make the ELM efficient in achieving an excellent learning performance. ELMs have successfully been applied in many domains, including medical domains such as breast cancer detection, pathological brain detection, and ductal carcinoma in situ detection, but not yet tested on detecting COVID-19. Hence, this work aims to identify the effectiveness of employing OGA-ELM in detecting COVID-19 using chest X-ray images. In order to reduce the dimensionality of a histogram oriented gradient features, we use principal component analysis. The performance of OGA-ELM is evaluated on a benchmark dataset containing 188 chest X-ray images with two classes: a healthy and a COVID-19 infected. The experimental result shows that the OGA-ELM achieves 100.00% accuracy with fast computation time. This demonstrates that OGA-ELM is an efficient method for COVID-19 detecting using chest X-ray images."
2015,Detection of breast abnormalities of thermograms based on a new segmentation method,"Breast cancer is one from various diseases that has got great attention in the last decades. This due to the number of women who died because of this disease. Segmentation is always an important step in developing a CAD system. This paper proposed an automatic segmentation method for the Region of Interest (ROI) from breast thermograms. This method is based on the data acquisition protocol parameter (the distance from the patient to the camera) and the image statistics of DMR-IR database. To evaluated the results of this method, an approach for the detection of breast abnormalities of thermograms was also proposed. Statistical and texture features from the segmented ROI were extracted and the SVM with its kernel function was used to detect the normal and abnormal breasts based on these features. The experimental results, using the benchmark database, DMR-IR, shown that the classification accuracy reached (100%). Also, using the measurements of the recall and the precision, the classification results reached 100%. This means that the proposed segmentation method is a promising technique for extracting the ROI of breast thermograms."
2021,"A Multicenter Phase II Trial of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab in Unresectable or Metastatic Metaplastic Breast Cancer: Cohort 36 of Dual Anti–CTLA-4 and Anti–PD-1 Blockade in Rare Tumors (DART, SWOG S1609)","Purpose: Metaplastic breast cancer (MpBC) is a rare aggressive subtype that responds poorly to cytotoxics. Median survival is approximately 8 months for metastatic disease. We report results for advanced MpBC treated with ipilimumab + nivolumab, a cohort of S1609 for rare cancers (DART: NCT02834013). Patients and Methods: Prospective, open-label, multicenter phase II (two-stage) trial of ipilimumab (1 mg/kg i.v. every 6 weeks) plus nivolumab (240 mg i.v. every 2 weeks) for advanced MpBC. Primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and toxicity. Results: Overall, 17 evaluable patients enrolled. Median age was 60 years (26–85); median number of prior therapy lines was 2 (0–5). ORR was 18%; 3 of 17 patients achieved objective responses (1 complete, 2 partial responses; 2 spindle cell, 1 chondromyxoid histology), which are ongoing at 28+, 33+, and 34+ months, respectively. Median PFS and OS were 2 and 12 months, respectively. Altogether, 11 patients (65%) experienced adverse events (AE), including one grade 5 AE. Eight patients (47%) developed an immune-related AE (irAE), with adrenal insufficiency observed in all 3 responders. Responses occurred in tumors with low tumor mutational burden, low PD-L1, and absent tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. Conclusions: The ipilimumab and nivolumab combination showed no new safety signals and met its primary endpoint with 18% ORR in advanced, chemotherapy-refractory MpBC. All responses are ongoing at >2 to almost 3 years later. The effect of ipilimumab and nivolumab was associated with exceptional responses in a subset of patients versus no activity. This combination warrants further investigation in MpBC, with special attention to understanding mechanism of action, and carefully designed to weigh against the significant risks of irAEs."
2020,Machine-learning for Precision Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Prediction of the Nanoparticles Cellular internalization.,"In the field of theranostics, diagnostic nanoparticles are de-signed to collect highly patient-selective disease profiles, which is then leveraged by a set of nanotherapeutics to improve the therapeutic results. Despite their early promise, high inter-patient and intra-tumoral heterogeneities make any rational design and analysis of these theranostics platforms remained extremely problematic. Recent advances in deep learning-based tools may help bridge this gap, using pattern recognition algo-rithms for better diagnostic precision and therapeutic outcome. Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a conundrum because of the complex molecular diversity, making its diagnosis and therapy challenging. To address these challenges, we propose a method to predict the cellular internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) against different cancer stages using artificial intelli-gence. Here we demonstrate for the first time that a combina-tion of machine learning (ML) algorithm and characteristic cellular uptake responses for individual cancer cell types can be successfully used to classify various cancer cell types. Utilizing this approach, we can optimize the nanomaterials to get an optimum structure-internalization response for a given particle. This methodology predicted the structure-internalization re-sponse of the evaluated nanoparticles with remarkable accuracy (Q2=0.9). We anticipate that it can reduce the effort by mini-mizing the number of nanoparticles that need to be tested and could be utilized as a screening tool for designing nanothera-peutics. Following this, we have proposed a diagnostic nano-material-based platform used to assemble a patient-specific cancer profile with the assistant of machine-learning (ML). The platform is comprised of eight carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) with multifarious surface chemistries that can differentiate healthy breast cells from cancerous cells and then subclassify TNBC cells vs. non-TNBC cells, within the TNBC group. Arti-ficial The artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm has been successfully used in identifying the type of cancer cells from 36 unknown cancer samples with an overall accuracy of >98%, providing potential applications in cancer diagnostics."
2018,Identification of serum miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p as biomarkers for breast cancer,"Breast cancer is one of the most malignant diseases in women worldwide. Serum microRNAs (miRNAs), with the characteristics of high sensitivity and specificity, have recently attracted more attentions to serve as potential biomarkers for tumor diseases. In this study, 194 breast cancer patients’ serum samples were collected before surgery and enrolled into different groups based on their diagnostic information. To search for breast cancer diagnostic biomarkers, serum miRNAs were screened by microarray in pooled samples of healthy volunteers and breast cancer patients in different clinical stages. The miRNAs were further verified in each individual patient’s serum samples in diagnostic and predictive sets. The serum level of miR-1915-3p was upregulated and miR-455-3p was downregulated significantly in breast cancer patients compared with healthy volunteers. Furthermore, the patients with infiltrating carcinoma or lymph node metastasis had a higher serum level of miR-1915-3p and lower serum level of miR-455-3p than patients with the carcinoma in situ or patients without lymph node metastasis. ROC analysis suggested that miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p had the potential as a promising serum diagnostic and predictive biomarkers of breast cancer. miR-1915-3p was over-expressed in certain human breast cancer cells. Functional experiments in vitro showed that miR-1915-3p enhanced cell proliferative and migrational abilities. Overexpression of miR-1915-3p repressed target gene DUSP3 and activated ERK1/2. Collectively, this study provided a new insight that miR-1915-3p might play a role in the development of breast cancer and that serum miR-1915-3p and miR-455-3p could serve as diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for breast cancer."
2018,Sequential Modeling of Deep Features for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification,"Computerized approaches for automated classification of histopathology images can help in reducing the manual observational workload of pathologists. In recent years, like in other areas, deep networks have also attracted attention for histopathology image analysis. However, existing approaches have paid little attention in exploring multilayer features for improving the classification. We believe that considering multi-layered features is important as different regions in the images, which are in turn at different magnifications may contain useful discriminative information at different levels of hierarchy. Considering the dependency exists among the layers in deep learning, we propose sequential framework which utilizes multi-layered deep features that are extracted from fine-tuned DenseNet. A decision is made by layer for a sample only if it passes a pre-defined cut-off confidence for that layer otherwise, the sample is passed on to next layers. Various experiments on publicly available BreaKHis dataset, demonstrate the proposed framework yields better performance, in most cases, than typically used highest layer features. We also compare results with the framework where each layer is treated independently. This indicates that low-mid-level features also carry useful discriminative information, when explicitly considered. We also demonstrate an improved performance over various state-of-the-art methods."
2022,An Optimized Framework for Breast Cancer Classification Using Machine Learning,"Breast cancer, if diagnosed and treated early, has a better chance of surviving. Many studies have shown that a larger number of ultrasound images are generated every day, and the number of radiologists able to analyze this medical data is very limited. This often results in misclassification of breast lesions, resulting in a high false-positive rate. In this article, we propose a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that can automatically generate an optimized algorithm. To train machine learning, we employ 13 features out of 185 available. Five machine learning classifiers were used to classify malignant versus benign tumors. The experimental results revealed Bayesian optimization with a tree-structured Parzen estimator based on a machine learning classifier for 10-fold cross-validation. The LightGBM classifier performs better than the other four classifiers, achieving 99.86% accuracy, 100.0% precision, 99.60% recall, and 99.80% for the FI score."
2017,"Evaluation of quality of life in women with breast cancer, with particular emphasis on sexual satisfaction, future perspectives and body image, depending on the method of surgery.","OBJECTIVES Both because of the large number of women undergoing surgery and a high cure rates, psychological rehabilitation of the consequences of breast cancer and side effects of their treatment is a major challenge of modern psychooncology. Aim. The study analyzed the quality of life in women with breast cancer, with particular emphasis on indicators of sexual satisfaction, future perspectives and body image, depending on the method of surgery. METHODS The study included 42 women aged 35-70 years, 3 months after surgery due to early breast cancer, treated with adjuvant chemotherapy. The following research tools were used in the study: two EORTC questionnaires: QLQ-C30, BR23, and sexual function questionnaire: PL-FSFI. RESULTS There was no significant difference in the overall quality of life, depending on the type of surgery. The greatest local complaints were reported by patients after breast conserving surgery (BCT) with axillary lymphadenectomy. A higher level of cognitive functioning but a greater severity of systemic side effects was found in women undergoing mastectomy compared to BCT-patients. Women who underwent surgery of the right breast reported increased problems in sexual functioning (p = 0.034). Multiple regression analysis showed a positive correlation of the emotional functioning variable with the assessment of future perspectives (p = 0.01) and body image (p = 0.007). CONCLUSIONS The type of surgical technique does not affect the overall quality of life and sexual satisfaction. Problems with memory and attention do not correlate directly with the side effects, and as such require an independent diagnostics. Women undergoing treatment of the dominant-side breast should be the candidates for sexology consultation. There is a risk of disturbances in the body image and in the assessment of future perspectives in patients with emotional disorders observed within 3 months after surgery."
2022,Intelligent Breast Abnormality Framework for Detection and Evaluation of Breast Abnormal Parameters,"Unlike the healthy cells in the breast tissue, cancerous breast cells are unwelcome and have strange properties. In both sexes, this will quickly expand and infiltrate adjacent tissue, leading to the formation of a tumour. Using the Intelligent-Breast Abnormality Detection (I-BAD) framework, many breast cancer parameters are evaluated in this article. It has already been shown that some indicators may be used for early detection of breast cancer. There is also discussion of the instruments and strategies that facilitate the monitoring of the selected breast health metrics. Classification methods that use machine learning to store and analyse data are also discussed. The suggested I-BAD framework’s process is then visually shown in clean drawings."
2023,Machine Learning-Based Label-Free SERS Profiling of Exosomes for Accurate Fuzzy Diagnosis of Cancer and Dynamic Monitoring of Drug Therapeutic Processes.,"Exosomes are a class of extracellular vesicles secreted by cells, which can be used as promising noninvasive biomarkers for the early diagnosis and treatment of diseases, especially cancer. However, due to the heterogeneity of exosomes, it remains a grand challenge to distinguish accurately and reliably exosomes from clinical samples. Herein, we achieve accurate fuzzy discrimination of exosomes from human serum samples for accurate diagnosis of breast cancer and cervical cancer through machine learning-based label-free surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS), by using ""hot spot"" rich 3D plasmonic AuNPs nanomembranes as substrates. Due to the existence of some weak distinguishable SERS fingerprint signals and the high sensitivity of the method, the machine learning-based SERS analysis can precisely identify three (normal and cancerous) cell lines, two of which are different types of cancer cells, without specific labeling of biomarkers. The prediction accuracy based on the machine learning algorithm was up to 91.1% for the discrimination of different cell lines (H8, HeLa, and MCF-7 cell)-derived exosomes. Our model trained with SERS spectra of cell-derived exosomes could reach 93.3% prediction accuracy for clinical samples. Furthermore, the action mechanism of the chemotherapeutic process of MCF-7 cells can be revealed by dynamic monitoring of SERS profiling of the exosomes secreted. The method would be useful for noninvasive and accurate diagnosis and postoperative assessment of cancer or other diseases in the future."
2019,Integrated analysis of co‐expression and ceRNA network identifies five lncRNAs as prognostic markers for breast cancer,"Long non‐coding RNAs (lncRNAs), which competitively bind miRNAs to regulate target mRNA expression in the competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) network, have attracted increasing attention in breast cancer research. We aim to find more effective therapeutic targets and prognostic markers for breast cancer. LncRNA, mRNA and miRNA expression profiles of breast cancer were downloaded from TCGA database. We screened the top 5000 lncRNAs, top 5000 mRNAs and all miRNAs to perform weighted gene co‐expression network analysis. The correlation between modules and clinical information of breast cancer was identified by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Based on the most relevant modules, we constructed a ceRNA network of breast cancer. Additionally, the standard Kaplan‐Meier univariate curve analysis was adopted to identify the prognosis of lncRNAs. Ultimately, a total of 23 and 5 modules were generated in the lncRNAs/mRNAs and miRNAs co‐expression network, respectively. According to the Green module of lncRNAs/mRNAs and Blue module of miRNAs, our constructed ceRNA network consisted of 52 lncRNAs, 17miRNAs and 79 mRNAs. Through survival analysis, 5 lncRNAs (AL117190.1, COL4A2‐AS1, LINC00184, MEG3 and MIR22HG) were identified as crucial prognostic factors for patients with breast cancer. Taken together, we have identified five novel lncRNAs related to prognosis of breast cancer. Our study has contributed to the deeper understanding of the molecular mechanism of breast cancer and provided novel insights into the use of breast cancer drugs and prognosis."
2018,Efficacy of psychosocial and physical activity‐based interventions to improve body image among women treated for breast cancer: A systematic review,"Body image concerns warrant attention among women who have undergone treatment for breast cancer, due to their significant consequences for psychological and physical health, and interpersonal relationships. This paper systematically reviews the effectiveness of interventions on body image outcomes among this group, in order to inform health care provision and strategic directions for research."
2017,"Exendin-4, a Glucagonlike Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist, Attenuates Breast Cancer Growth by Inhibiting NF-&kgr;B Activation","Incretin therapies have received much attention because of their tissue-protective effects, which extend beyond those associated with glycemic control. Cancer is a primary cause of death in patients who have diabetes mellitus. We previously reported antiprostate cancer effects of the glucagonlike peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor (GLP-1R) agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4). Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in female patients who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Thus, we examined whether GLP-1 action could attenuate breast cancer. GLP-1R was expressed in human breast cancer tissue and MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and KPL-1 cell lines. We found that 0.1 to 10 nM Ex-4 significantly decreased the number of breast cancer cells in a dose-dependent manner. Although Ex-4 did not induce apoptosis, it attenuated breast cancer cell proliferation significantly and dose-dependently. However, the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin did not affect breast cancer cell proliferation. When MCF-7 cells were transplanted into athymic mice, Ex-4 decreased MCF-7 tumor size in vivo. Ki67 immunohistochemistry revealed that breast cancer cell proliferation was significantly reduced in tumors extracted from Ex-4-treated mice. In MCF-7 cells, Ex-4 significantly inhibited nuclear factor κB (NF-κB ) nuclear translocation and target gene expression. Furthermore, Ex-4 decreased both Akt and IκB phosphorylation. These results suggest that GLP-1 could attenuate breast cancer cell proliferation via activation of GLP-1R and subsequent inhibition of NF-κB activation."
2016,Breast cancer in young women.,"Breast cancer (BC) in young women is rare, affecting only 4-6% of women under the age of 40. Regardless, BC remains the most common malignancy among younger patients. Recently, a significant increase in BC rates has been observed among pre-menopausal subjects. Breast cancer in young women requires special attention due to its specific morphologic and prognostic characteristics and unique aspects, including fertility preservation and psychosocial issues (e.g. its impact on family life and career). Young women are more likely to have tumors with higher incidence of negative clinicopathologic features (higher histological grade, more lymph node positivity, lower estrogen receptor (ER) positivity, higher rates of Her2/neu overexpression). Also, they tend to be diagnosed at more advanced stages of the disease. That, in turn, contributes to less favorable prognosis as compared to older women. Young women are generally treated similarly to older patients. Surgical management includes mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery, followed by radiation therapy (younger women have higher local recurrence rates than older women, especially after breast-conserving therapy). Although the basics of chemotherapy are the same for patients of all ages, younger women have some special considerations. It is important to consider options for fertility preservation before starting systemic treatment. Patients should have access to genetic testing as their results may affect the choice of therapy. Younger women and their families should receive adequate psychological support and counselling."
2021,MCUa: Multi-Level Context and Uncertainty Aware Dynamic Deep Ensemble for Breast Cancer Histology Image Classification,"Breast histology image classification is a crucial step in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. In breast pathological diagnosis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated great success using digitized histology slides. However, tissue classification is still challenging due to the high visual variability of the large-sized digitized samples and the lack of contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN, called Multi-level Context and Uncertainty aware (MCUa) dynamic deep learning ensemble model. MCUa model consists of several multi-level context-aware models to learn the spatial dependency between image patches in a layer-wise fashion. It exploits the high sensitivity to the multi-level contextual information using an uncertainty quantification component to accomplish a novel dynamic ensemble model. MCUa model has achieved a high accuracy of 98.11% on a breast cancer histology image dataset. Experimental results show the superior effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to the state-of-the-art histology classification models."
2020,Feature Selection and Instance Selection from Clinical Datasets Using Co-operative Co-evolution and Classification Using Random Forest,"ABSTRACT Co-operative co-evolution approach solves problems by breaking them into subproblems. The proposed framework for Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) uses a co-operative coevolution approach which treats Feature Selection (FS) and Instance Selection (IS) as independent subproblems. FS and IS remove less relevant features and instances, respectively, thereby improving the overall performance of the system. In this work, both Feature and Instance selection are done using the wrapper approach, which uses co-operative co-evolution and random forest classifier. The reduced dataset is used to train a random forest classifier and this trained model helped in making clinical decisions. These decisions assist physicians as the second opinion for diagnosis and treatment. Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC), Hepatitis, Pima Indian Diabetes (PID), Cleveland Heart Disease (CHD), Statlog Heart Disease (SHD), Vertebral Column, and Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC) datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository are used for experimentation. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 97.1%, 82.3%, 81.01%, 93.4%, 96.8%, 91.4%, and 72.2% for datasets WDBC, Hepatitis, PID, CHD, SHD, vertebral column, and HCC, respectively. The results prove that the CDSS-developed using co-operative coevolution can efficiently assist the physicians in decision-making."
2022,Breast Cancer Detection and Classification using Deep Learning Xception Algorithm,"—Breast Cancer (BC) is one of the leading cause of deaths worldwide. Approximately 10 million people pass away internationally from breast cancer in the year 2020. Breast Cancer is a fatal disease and very popular among women globally. It is ranked fourth among the fatal diseases of different cancers, for example colorectal cancer, cervical cancer, and brain tumors. Furthermore, the number of new cases of breast cancer is anticipated to upsurge by 70% in the next twenty years. Consequently, early detection and precise diagnosis of breast cancer plays an essential part in enhancing the diagnosis and improving the breast cancer survival rate of patients from 30 to 50%. Through the advances of technology in healthcare, deep learning takes a significant role in handling and inspecting a great number of X-ray, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT) images. The aim of this study is to propose a deep learning model to detect and classify breast cancers. Breast cancers has eight classes of cancers: benign adenosis, benign fibroadenoma, benign phyllodes tumor, benign tubular adenoma, malignant ductal carcinoma, malignant lobular carcinoma, malignant mucinous carcinoma, and malignant papillary carcinoma. The dataset was collected from Kaggle depository for breast cancer detection and classification. The measurement that was used in the evaluation of the proposed model includes: F1-score, recall, precision, accuracy. The proposed model was trained, validated and tested using the preprocessed dataset. The results showed that Precision was (97.60%), Recall (97.60%) and F1-Score (97.58%). This indicates that deep learning models are suitable for detecting and classifying breast cancers precisely."
2017,A pilot randomized controlled trial of cognitive bias modification to reduce fear of breast cancer recurrence,"The most common, persistent concern among survivors of breast cancer is the fear that their disease will return, yet to the authors' knowledge, few interventions targeting fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) have been developed to date. The current pilot study examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of a home‐delivered cognitive bias modification intervention to reduce FCR. The intervention, called Attention and Interpretation Modification for Fear of Breast Cancer Recurrence (AIM‐FBCR), targeted 2 types of cognitive biases (ie, attention and interpretation biases)."
2015,pH-Sensitive Polymeric Nanoparticles with Gold(I) Compound Payloads Synergistically Induce Cancer Cell Death through Modulation of Autophagy.,"Various nanomaterials have been demonstrated as autophagy inducers owing to their endocytosis cell uptake pathway and impairment of lysosomes. pH-dependent nanomaterials as drug delivery systems that are capable of dissociating in weakly acidic lysosomal environment (pH 4-5) and consequently releasing the payloads into the cytoplasm have been paid extensive attention, but their autophagy-modulating effects are less reported so far. In this study, we report pH-sensitive micelle-like nanoparticles (NPs) that self-assembled from poly(β-amino ester)s to induce cell autophagy. By encapsulation of gold(I) compounds (Au(I)) into hydrophobic domains of NPs, the resultant Au(I)-loaded NPs (Au(I)⊂NPs) shows synergistic cancer cell killing performance. The Au(I)⊂NPs enter cells through endocytosis pathway and accumulate into acidic lysosomes. Subsequently, the protonation of tertiary amines of poly(β-amino ester)s triggers the dissociation of micelles, damages the lysosomes, and blocks formation of autolysosomes from fusion of lysosomes with autophagosomes. In addition, Au(I) preferentially inhibits thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells that directly links to up-regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and consequently induce autophagy and apoptosis. The blockade of autophagy leads to excessive depletion of cellular organelles and essential proteins and ultimately results in cell death. Therefore, pH-sensitive polymeric nanoparticles with gold(I) compound payloads can synergistically induce cancer cell death through regulation of autophagy. Identification of the pH-sensitive nanomaterials for synergistically inducing cell death through regulation autophagy may open a new avenue for cancer therapy."
2016,Delay in Cancer Diagnosis: Causes and Possible Solutions.,"Cancer is the leading cause of death in developed and developing countries. Cancer mortality is expected to rise to an estimated 13.1 million deaths annually by 2030.1 However, certain types of cancer have a high chance of cure if they are detected at an early stage and adequately treated.2 The delays in cancer diagnosis may occur throughout the diagnostic pathway: patient, primary care, and secondary care. Patient delays may occur when the patient fails to recognise and act on suspicious cancer symptoms.3 Poor public awareness for early symptoms of cancer is considered to be the predominant reason for delayed presentation, particularly if symptoms are atypical in nature.4 A recent community-based study measuring public awareness of cancer symptoms in Oman showed that the majority of Omanis were unable to identify common cancer symptoms. These included unexplained bleeding, difficulty swallowing, change in bowel or bladder habits, sores that did not heal, unexplained pain, cough or hoarseness, unexplained lump or swelling, change in the appearance of a mole, and unexplained weight loss. The study also showed that the most reported barriers to seeking timely medical help included being too busy to make an appointment, concern about what the doctor might find, and difficulty talking to the doctor. The study concluded that urgent strategies are needed to increase public awareness in Oman for cancer symptoms.5 The Oman Cancer Association (OCA) is a non-governmental organization working to increase public awareness of cancers using community-based programs. The association works to educate the community about early symptoms of cancer, promote self-examination for cancer (e.g., breast cancer) and promote proper, timely intervention. However, still more public educational activities are needed, particularly in the rural communities. Although the school science curriculum in Oman covers many concepts related to health education, none of them are related to awareness of risk factors for cancer or cancer symptoms.6 Thus, curriculum-based health education regarding the prevention of cancer and motivation of children to incorporate healthy lifestyle practices into their daily lives are needed. Using media such as TV broadcasts, life lectures, seminars, and social media could improve cancer awareness among adolescents. Primary care delays may occur in the recognition, investigation, and referral for symptoms suspicious of cancer.3 Although primary care is the first point of contact for patients using national health services in many countries around the world, delay in cancer diagnosis remains as an ongoing problem at this level. Primary care physicians are expected to identify patients with possible cancer at an early stage, but the diagnosis of cancer is relatively uncommon for individual primary care physician as more than 80% of patients present with non-specific symptoms.7 Indeed, the main concern of a primary care physician is to differentiate the minority of patients who need urgent attention from the majority of patients who are likely to have self-limiting conditions.8 Primary health care services in Oman, similar to the most Arabic countries, are provided by a network of local health centres. However, patients can access medical services at different places, including private clinics and hospitals. Also, some patients may travel abroad for investigations, treatments, medical check-ups, and to obtain a second opinion.9 As a result, there is a serious lack of continuity of care. Continuity of care with a particular physician has been found to increase early detection of cancer and the likelihood of cancer testing.10 Thus, support is needed to increase continuity of care through promoting appointment systems and limited access to a specific primary care physician for non-urgent conditions. Although the Ministry of Health in Oman developed a guideline for early detection and screening of breast cancer in 2010, there is also a need for guidelines to identify alarming symptoms for other types of cancer and to refer suspected patients to a specialist within a specific period.11 A policy has been adopted in the UK to refer patients who are suspected of having cancer to a specialist within two weeks.12 Therefore, availability of guidelines for primary care physicians in Oman to identify suspected symptoms of cancer and refer them early to specialists are important to shorten the appointment waiting time and improve cancer prognosis. In the hospital, delays can be due to the doctors’ delay in making a diagnosis and starting treatment. A doctors’ delay in making a diagnosis is defined as the time taken from primary care referral to diagnosis. Delay of treatment is defined as the interval between diagnosis and the start of treatment.13 Considerable diagnostic delay might occur if several invasive procedures are needed to confirm the diagnosis and the suitability for surgical treatment.14 In summary, a delay in cancer diagnosis can occur at various levels. The patient may fail to recognise suspicious cancer symptoms or act on them. The primary care physician may not recognise patients with suspicious cancer symptoms and investigate them appropriately or refer on time. Patients with suspicious cancer in secondary care may not be seen on time, or they may be referred to the wrong specialty. Thus, using media to broadcast the message of awareness in the community should increase public knowledge of cancer symptoms and the importance of seeking timely medical attention. Regularly updating primary care physicians about alarming symptoms of cancer, developing guidelines to identify these symptoms, promoting continuity of care, and enabling access to specialist expertise through prompt referrals should all help to prevent delays in cancer diagnosis."
2019,Identifying the reasons for delayed presentation of Pakistani breast cancer patients at a tertiary care hospital,"Background Delay in seeking health care by breast cancer patients is associated with advanced stage of disease at presentation and poor survival rates. This study aimed to identify the reasons for delayed presentation and their association with various sociodemographic variables. Methods A total of 200 female patients with abnormal clinical findings, ie, lump or palpable mass, were consecutively invited for this study. Diagnostic delay was defined as a consultation with a health care provider more than 3 months from the appearance of the first symptoms. Sociodemographic variables, presenting symptoms, knowledge about diseases and its symptoms, time between seeking medical attention after appearance of symptoms and causes of delayed presentation were investigated. Chi-squared and logistic regression tests for significance and associations were used. Results Among 125 women with breast cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria, aged 24–75 years, 88.8% (n=111) presented late (≥3 months) and 59% presented with advanced stage of disease (stage III/IV). The majority (65.6%) were older than 40 years of age, 99.2% were married, 60.8% had <8 years of education, 67.2% had poor social status, and 64.8% had a negative family history of any cancer type. Almost all patients (96%) complained about the presence of a painless lump in their breast. Ignorance of disease or the presence of painless lumps in the breast and low financial resources for therapy (81.1%) were the main variables associated with delayed presentation. Educational factors (P<0.001, OR 4.682) and social status (P<0.001, OR 1.8) were also associated with delayed presentation. Conclusion Our study highlighted the variables associated with delayed presentation in Pakistani breast cancer patients. A significant number of patients presented late owing to misconceptions and poor knowledge about the disease and its symptoms, while illiteracy and poor social status were the major contributing factors for delayed presentation, resulting in an advanced presentation of disease and ultimately a decreased survival rate."
2016,Research progress of cardioprotective agents for prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity.,"Anthracyclines, including doxorubicin, epirubicin, daunorubicin and aclarubicin, are widely used as chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of hematologic and solid tumor, including acute leukemia, lymphoma, breast cancer, gastric cancer, soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian cancer. In the cancer treatment, anthracyclines also can be combined with other chemotherapies and molecular-targeted drugs. The combination of anthracyclines with other therapies is usually the first-line treatment. Anthracyclines are effective and potent agents with a broad antitumor spectrum, but may cause adverse reactions, including hair loss, myelotoxicity, as well as cardiotoxicity. We used hematopoietic stimulating factors to control the myelotoxicity, such as G-CSF, EPO and TPO. However, the cardiotoxicity is the most serious side effect of anthracyclines. Clinical research and practical observations indicated that the cardiotoxicity of anthracyclines is commonly progressive and irreversible. Especially to those patients who have the first time use of anthracyclines, the damage is common. Therefore, early detection and prevention of anthracyclines induced cardiotoxicity are particularly important and has already aroused more attention in clinic. By literature review, we reviewed the research progress of cardioprotective agents for prevention of anthracycline cardiotoxicity."
2023,BC2NetRF: Breast Cancer Classification from Mammogram Images Using Enhanced Deep Learning Features and Equilibrium-Jaya Controlled Regula Falsi-Based Features Selection,"One of the most frequent cancers in women is breast cancer, and in the year 2022, approximately 287,850 new cases have been diagnosed. From them, 43,250 women died from this cancer. An early diagnosis of this cancer can help to overcome the mortality rate. However, the manual diagnosis of this cancer using mammogram images is not an easy process and always requires an expert person. Several AI-based techniques have been suggested in the literature. However, still, they are facing several challenges, such as similarities between cancer and non-cancer regions, irrelevant feature extraction, and weak training models. In this work, we proposed a new automated computerized framework for breast cancer classification. The proposed framework improves the contrast using a novel enhancement technique called haze-reduced local-global. The enhanced images are later employed for the dataset augmentation. This step aimed at increasing the diversity of the dataset and improving the training capability of the selected deep learning model. After that, a pre-trained model named EfficientNet-b0 was employed and fine-tuned to add a few new layers. The fine-tuned model was trained separately on original and enhanced images using deep transfer learning concepts with static hyperparameters’ initialization. Deep features were extracted from the average pooling layer in the next step and fused using a new serial-based approach. The fused features were later optimized using a feature selection algorithm known as Equilibrium-Jaya controlled Regula Falsi. The Regula Falsi was employed as a termination function in this algorithm. The selected features were finally classified using several machine learning classifiers. The experimental process was conducted on two publicly available datasets—CBIS-DDSM and INbreast. For these datasets, the achieved average accuracy is 95.4% and 99.7%. A comparison with state-of-the-art (SOTA) technology shows that the obtained proposed framework improved the accuracy. Moreover, the confidence interval-based analysis shows consistent results of the proposed framework."
2018,Feature engineering for sentiment analysis in e-health forums,"Introduction Exploiting information in health-related social media services is of great interest for patients, researchers and medical companies. The challenge is, however, to provide easy, quick and relevant access to the vast amount of information that is available. One step towards facilitating information access to online health data is opinion mining. Even though the classification of patient opinions into positive and negative has been previously tackled, most works make use of machine learning methods and bags of words. Our first contribution is an extensive evaluation of different features, including lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based, sentiment-based and word embeddings features to represent patient-authored texts for polarity classification. The second contribution of this work is the study of polar facts (i.e. objective information with polar connotations). Traditionally, the presence of polar facts has been neglected and research in polarity classification has been bounded to opinionated texts. We demonstrate the existence and importance of polar facts for the polarity classification of health information. Material and methods We annotate a set of more than 3500 posts to online health forums of breast cancer, crohn and different allergies, respectively. Each sentence in a post is manually labeled as “experience”, “fact” or “opinion”, and as “positive”, “negative” and “neutral”. Using this data, we train different machine learning algorithms and compare traditional bags of words representations with word embeddings in combination with lexical, syntactic, semantic, network-based and emotional properties of texts to automatically classify patient-authored contents into positive, negative and neutral. Beside, we experiment with a combination of textual and semantic representations by generating concept embeddings using the UMLS Metathesaurus. Results We reach two main results: first, we find that it is possible to predict polarity of patient-authored contents with a very high accuracy (≈ 70 percent) using word embeddings, and that this considerably outperforms more traditional representations like bags of words; and second, when dealing with medical information, negative and positive facts (i.e. objective information) are nearly as frequent as negative and positive opinions and experiences (i.e. subjective information), and their importance for polarity classification is crucial."
2018,Combinational drug delivery using nanocarriers for breast cancer treatments: A review.,"Breast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer in women that requires special attention due to low response to conventional treatments. The common method for treating cancer (especially BC) is applying a single anticancer agent, however, due to some disadvantages including cytotoxicity, side effects, and multidrug resistance, the efficiency and application of this method are limited. To overcome these challenges, the combinational delivery of anticancer drugs (including chemical agents, genetic materials, etc.) has been introduced. To increase the efficacy of this new method, several nanocarriers including inorganic nanoparticles (such as, magnetic nanoparticles, silica nanoparticles, etc.) and organic ones (e.g., dendrimers, liposomes, micelles, and polymeric nanoparticles) have been used. Based on the literature, combinational delivery using nanocarriers showed promising results in the treatment of BC. In this review, combination regimens for the treatment of BC, nanocarriers containing combinations of pharmaceutical agents (including small molecule chemotherapeutic, biological, and gene therapy agents) as an opportunity to overcome chemotherapy challenges and, finally, examples of these formulations have been presented. This review aims to provide a better understanding of these increasingly important new methods of cancer treatment and the main issues and key considerations for a rational design of nanocarriers used in combinational delivery of different synergistic anticancer agents. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

2017,Using deep learning for mammography classification,"Breast biopsies based on the results of mammography and ultrasound have been diagnosed as benign at a rate of approximately 40 to 60 percent. Negative biopsy results have negative impacts on many aspects such as unnecessary operations, fear, pain, and cost. Therefore, there is a need for a more reliable technique to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies in the diagnosis of breast cancer. So, computer-aided diagnostic methods are very important for doctors to make more accurate decisions and to avoid unnecessary biopsies. For this purpose, we apply deep learning using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify abnormalities as benign or malignant in mammogram images by using two different databases namely, mini-MIAS and BCDR. While mini-MIAS database has valuable information like location of the center of abnormality and radius of the circle that surrounds the abnormality, BCDR database does not have. When we use both dataset as they are, we observe accuracy, precision, recall, and f-score values between around 60% and 72%. In order to improve our results, we take the benefit of preprocessing methods containing cropping, augmentation, and balancing image data. In an effort to crop image data sourced from BCDR, we create a mask to find region of interest. After applying our preprocessing methods over the BCDR dataset, we observe that classification accuracy improves from 65% to around 85%. When we compare the classification accuracy, precision, recall and f-score obtained from the MIAS database with those obtained from the BCDR database we found that after applying preprocessing methods to BCDR dataset, the classification performance become very close to each other for the two datasets."
2015,The Effect of Mindfulness-Based Music Therapy on Attention and Mood in Women Receiving Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Breast Cancer: A Pilot Study.,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES To explore the efficacy of mindfulness-based music therapy (MBMT) to improve attention and decrease mood distress experienced by women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. DESIGN Quantitative, descriptive, longitudinal approach. SETTING A comprehensive cancer hospital and a university in southern Florida. SAMPLE 15 women with a diagnosis of breast cancer, stages I-III, receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. METHODS Participants individually received MBMT for one hour per week for four weeks. The sessions consisted of varied music activities accompanied by mindfulness attitudes, or mental strategies that enhance moment-to-moment awareness, and weekly homework. Demographic information was collected at baseline. MAIN RESEARCH VARIABLES Attention was measured using Conners' Continuous Performance Test II. Mood was measured using the Profile of Mood States-Brief Form. Narrative comments collected from the homework assignments served to reinforce quantitative data. FINDINGS Repeated measures analysis of variance showed that attention improved significantly over time. Although all mood states significantly improved from the beginning to the end of each MBMT session, the mood state of fatigue decreased significantly more than the other mood states. CONCLUSIONS MBMT enhances attention and mood, particularly the mood state of fatigue, in women with breast cancer receiving adjuvant chemotherapy. . IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING A preferred music listening and mindfulness exercise may be offered to women with breast cancer who experience attention problems and mood distress."
2016,Current Pharmaceutical Design,"Worldwide, the percentage of people aged over 60 years is growing up quicker than any other age group, as a result of both longer life expectancy and declining birth rates as well as a success of the public health policies and the socioeconomic development. The World Health Organization (WHO) has been pointed out recently that: “currently, one in every nine people in the world is 60 years of age or older. This is expected to increase to one in five people by 2050”. This success (the transition to a much older population) is a challenge for the modern society that shall maximize the health and the functional ability of older people as well as their social participation and safety to achieve an “active ageing”. “Health” refers to physical, mental and social well being as expressed in the WHO definition of health: “maintaining autonomy and independence for the older people is a key goal in the policy framework for active ageing”. “Active” refers to “continuing participation in social, economic, cultural, spiritual and civic affairs, not just the ability to be physically active or to participate in the labour force”. In this issue Alzetta et al. (University of Genoa, Italy) reviews the grounds and patterns of the structuring of longevity and ageing in our society [1]. The older people, even in poor countries, die of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), such as heart disease, cancer or diabetes, rather than of infectious or parasitic diseases. On 2010, the UN General Assembly passed the resolution A/RES/64/265NCD recognizing “the enormous human suffering, premature death and the seriously negative socioeconomic impact caused by the growing burden of NCD” and called for “global and national action at the highest level to address this development issue”. In this special issue Bousquet et al. (Inserm, France) review the complexity of NCDs intertwined with ageing, show an overview of the problem and propose practical examples of System Medicine (SM) applied to NCDs [2]. Moreover, Cesario et al. (IRCCS “San Raffaele Pisana”, Italy) review the novel system approaches to NCDs, discuss the passage from System Biology (SM) to SM and present the scientific and clinical background of a SM platform [3]. In this issue different pathologies, clinical conditions and pharmacological approaches are reviewed considering the role of ageing. Mazzucco et al. (Catholic University, Italy) review breast cancer in various age-groups and the response to Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor [4]. Piotrowicz et al. (Jagiellonian University, Poland) review the pharmacological management of hypertension [5], Matera et al. (Second University of Naples) propose new treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6], and Zanandrea et al. (University of 27/11/16, 17(19 Editorial (Thematic Issue: Disease Control and Active and Healthy Ageing: New Paradigms of Therapeutic Strategy) | BenthamScience Pagina 2 di 4 http://www.eurekaselect.com/120984 Toulose, France) review the treatment of sarcopenia [7]. As the population ages, the burden of neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer disease (AD), will increase creating an unsustainable healthcare challenge due to a lack of effective treatment. In this issue Hasnain and Vieweg (Memorial University of Newfoundland, Canada) overview the vascular risk factors in AD and vascular dementia [8]. AD is characterized by disturbance of various high preand cortical functions. Cholinergic projections innervate the prefrontal cortex and reduced cholinergic function is associated with cognitive deficits. Cholinergic neurons are specific neurons that synthesize and release acetylcholine (ACh). ACh acts at nicotinic receptors (nAChR) and muscarinic receptors (mAChR). U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved several prescription drugs to treat people who have been diagnosed with AD. The drugs include: Razadyne® (galantamine), Exelon® (rivastigmine), and Aricept® (donepezil). These drugs target acetylcholinesterase (defined acetylcholinesterase inhibitors: AChEI) and, in principle, elevate cholinergic signaling. Another drug is known as Namenda® (Memantine), an N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. None of these medications stops the disease itself: they help to maintain thinking, memory, and speaking skills but don’t influence the disease’ progression. Unfortunately these drugs are effective only for some patients, and may help only for a limited period of time. In this issue different authors describe new pharmacological approaches to neurodegenerative diseases beyond AChEI. Russo et al. (IRCCS “San Raffaele Pisana”, Italy) in this issue describe the neurobiology of the α7nAChR, its role in cognition and in AD, and the clinical status of the most promising molecules for the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in AD [9]. MicroRNA (miRNA), singlestranded RNA molecules consisting of 21-23 nucleotides, are post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression. Impaired miRNA levels are considered causally involved in many diseases, including neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. In this issue Greenberg and Soreq (Hebrew University, Israel) outline the current “state of the art” regarding miRNA regulation in neuropathology and explore the possibilities of the development of miRNA as therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases [10]. Many neurodegenerative diseases may be referred as misfolding diseases Cardinale et al. (IRCCS “San Raffaele Pisana”, Italy) review the ability of intrabodies to recognize misfolding and discuss the use of intrabodies against neurodegenerative disorders [11]. Chronic pain is a widespread problem affecting elder people, in this issue Taylor et al. (NEMA Research, USA) review the association between pain and obesity [12] and Del Bufalo et al. (IRCCS “San Raffaele Pisana”, Italy) review the background, findings, implications and problems in using compounds that act on α9α10-nAChR as potential target in the pathophysiology of chronic pain [13]. As well-known, ageing is a complex process resulting by the interaction between genetic, environmental/behavioral (such as smoking, diet, use of medication, occupational diseases), epigenetic (alterations in DNA methylation patterns, posttranslational modification of histones, and chromatin remodeling), and purely stochastic factors. The time-dependent accumulation of cellular damage is widely considered to be the general cause of ageing. Nine candidate hallmarks, that contribute to the ageing process and collectively determine the ageing phenotype, has been described recently. The conceptualizations of the hallmarks of ageing, as for the conceptualizations of the hallmarks of cancer, may offer an organizing principle to effort and rationalize the complexities of ageing (phenotypes and genotypes). In this issue 27/11/16, 17(19 Editorial (Thematic Issue: Disease Control and Active and Healthy Ageing: New Paradigms of Therapeutic Strategy) | BenthamScience Pagina 3 di 4 http://www.eurekaselect.com/120984 Jylhava (University of Tampere, Finland) reviews the genetic component of human longevity and its phenotypic effectors and discuss several rejuvenation strategies [13]. Capuron et al. (University Victor Segalen, France) review the role of immune system and inflammation in ageing [14]. “Frailty” is considered “a practical, unifying notion in the care of elderly patients that directs attention away from organ-specific diagnoses towards a more holistic viewpoint of the patient and their predicament”. Due to the increasing probability to develop chronic diseases with age, elderly are the main user group of drugs. Moreover, multiple co-occurring medical conditions enhance the complexity generating important therapeutic needs that in turn require drug optimal characterization (i.e. safety and efficacy) as well as appropriately prescription and use and compliance monitoring [discussed in references 2-6]. The term “geriatric drug therapy” explains well the whole value chain from the product development to utilization of the product by the patient itself. Interdisciplinary studies and integrated assessments are needed to deep understand the manifold sources of patient complexity and their interactions, and how provision of healthcare should be harmonized with complexity to optimize health [discussed in 2-3]. Better health promotion and disease prevention interventions will make a significant contribution to the sustainability of health and care systems. 'Omics' research (including genomics, epi-genomics, metagenomics, metabolomics and proteomics) allows the resolution of cell biological processes to “an exceptional high definition” that poses the challenge to determine “when” and “how” the “omics” information may be applied (public/private sectors) to develop personalized/stratified approach in health promotion, diseases prevention and diseases cure. Systems (bio, pharmacology) medicine approaches have the potential to tackle this complexity trough an integration of a variety of medical research and computational modeling. Passing from reductionism to a systemoriented perspective, medical research will take advantage of these highthroughput technologies unveiling their full potential [reviewed in 2-3]. An ageing population will have a strong upward impact on public spending for long term care. This is because frailty and disability rise sharply at older ages, especially amongst the very old (aged 80+) which will be the fastest growing segment of the population in the coming decades. According to the "" Ageing Working Group (AWG) reference scenario"" based on current policy settings, public spending on longterm care is projected to double, increasing from 1.2% of GDP (gross domestic product) in 2007 to 2.3% of GDP in 2060 in the EU as a whole. In the conclusions of this issue Cesario et al. (IRCCS “San Raffaele Pisana”, Italy) in collaboration with Auffray (European"
2022,Breast lesions classifications of mammographic images using a deep convolutional neural network-based approach,"Breast cancer is one of the worst illnesses, with a higher fatality rate among women globally. Breast cancer detection needs accurate mammography interpretation and analysis, which is challenging for radiologists owing to the intricate anatomy of the breast and low image quality. Advances in deep learning-based models have significantly improved breast lesions’ detection, localization, risk assessment, and categorization. This study proposes a novel deep learning-based convolutional neural network (ConvNet) that significantly reduces human error in diagnosing breast malignancy tissues. Our methodology is most effective in eliciting task-specific features, as feature learning is coupled with classification tasks to achieve higher performance in automatically classifying the suspicious regions in mammograms as benign and malignant. To evaluate the model’s validity, 322 raw mammogram images from Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) and 580 from Private datasets were obtained to extract in-depth features, the intensity of information, and the high likelihood of malignancy. Both datasets are magnificently improved through preprocessing, synthetic data augmentation, and transfer learning techniques to attain the distinctive combination of breast tumors. The experimental findings indicate that the proposed approach achieved remarkable training accuracy of 0.98, test accuracy of 0.97, high sensitivity of 0.99, and an AUC of 0.99 in classifying breast masses on mammograms. The developed model achieved promising performance that helps the clinician in the speedy computation of mammography, breast masses diagnosis, treatment planning, and follow-up of disease progression. Moreover, it has the immense potential over retrospective approaches in consistency feature extraction and precise lesions classification."
2021,Prediction of BRCA Gene Mutation in Breast Cancer Based on Deep Learning and Histopathology Images,"Background Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers and the leading cause of death from cancer among women worldwide. The genetic predisposition to breast cancer may be associated with a mutation in particular genes such as gene BRCA1/2. Patients who carry a germline pathogenic mutation in BRCA1/2 genes have a significantly increased risk of developing breast cancer and might benefit from targeted therapy. However, genetic testing is time consuming and costly. This study aims to predict the risk of gBRCA mutation by using the whole-slide pathology features of breast cancer H&E stains and the patients’ gBRCA mutation status. Methods In this study, we trained a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) of ResNet on whole-slide images (WSIs) to predict the gBRCA mutation in breast cancer. Since the dimensions are too large for slide-based training, we divided WSI into smaller tiles with the original resolution. The tile-based classification was then combined by adding the positive classification result to generate the combined slide-based accuracy. Models were trained based on the annotated tumor location and gBRCA mutation status labeled by a designated breast cancer pathologist. Four models were trained on tiles cropped at 5×, 10×, 20×, and 40× magnification, assuming that low magnification and high magnification may provide different levels of information for classification. Results A trained model was validated through an external dataset that contains 17 mutants and 47 wilds. In the external validation dataset, AUCs (95% CI) of DL models that used 40×, 20×, 10×, and 5× magnification tiles among all cases were 0.766 (0.763–0.769), 0.763 (0.758–0.769), 0.750 (0.738–0.761), and 0.551 (0.526–0.575), respectively, while the corresponding magnification slides among all cases were 0.774 (0.642–0.905), 0.804 (0.676–0.931), 0.828 (0.691–0.966), and 0.635 (0.471–0.798), respectively. The study also identified the influence of histological grade to the accuracy of the prediction. Conclusion In this paper, the combination of pathology and molecular omics was used to establish the gBRCA mutation risk prediction model, revealing the correlation between the whole-slide histopathological images and gRCA mutation risk. The results indicated that the prediction accuracy is likely to improve as the training data expand. The findings demonstrated that deep CNNs could be used to assist pathologists in the detection of gene mutation in breast cancer."
2019,Targeted imaging and targeted therapy of breast cancer cells via fluorescent double template-imprinted polymer coated silicon nanoparticles by an epitope approach.,"Targeting is vital for precise positioning and efficient therapy, and integrated platforms for diagnosis and therapy have attracted more and more attention. Herein, we established dual-template molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) coated fluorescent silicon nanoparticles (Si NPs) by using the linear peptide of the extracellular region of human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2) and adopting doxorubicin (DOX) as templates for targeted imaging and targeted therapy. Benefiting from the epitope imprinting approach, the imprinted sites generated by peptides on the MIP surface can be employed for recognizing the corresponding protein, which allowed the MIP to specifically and actively target HER2-positive breast cancer cells. Because of its ability to identify breast cancer cells, the MIP was applied for targeted fluorescence imaging by taking advantage of the excellent fluorescence properties of Si NPs, and the DOX-loaded MIP (MIP@DOX) can act as a therapeutic probe to effectively target and kill breast cancer cells. In fluorescence images, the targeting of the MIP promoted more uptake of the nanoparticles by cells than the non-imprinted polymer (NIP), so HER2-positive breast cancer cells incubated with the MIP exhibited stronger fluorescence, and there was no significant difference in fluorescence when HER2-negative cells and normal cells were respectively hatched with the MIP and NIP. Importantly, the cell viability was evaluated to demonstrate targeted accumulation and therapy of MIP@DOX for breast cancer cells. The nanoplatform for diagnosis and therapy combined the high sensitivity of fluorescence with the high selectivity of the molecular imprinting technique, which holds vital potential in targeted imaging and targeted therapy in vitro."
2020,CNN-Based Quality Assurance for Automatic Segmentation of Breast Cancer in Radiotherapy,"Purpose: More and more automatic segmentation tools are being introduced in routine clinical practice. However, physicians need to spend a considerable amount of time in examining the generated contours slice by slice. This greatly reduces the benefit of the tool's automaticity. In order to overcome this shortcoming, we developed an automatic quality assurance (QA) method for automatic segmentation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Materials and Methods: The study cohort comprised 680 patients with early-stage breast cancer who received whole breast radiation. The overall architecture of the automatic QA method for deep learning-based segmentation included the following two main parts: a segmentation CNN model and a QA network that was established based on ResNet-101. The inputs were from computed tomography, segmentation probability maps, and uncertainty maps. Two kinds of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) outputs were tested. One predicted the DSC quality level of each slice ([0.95, 1] for “good,” [0.8, 0.95] for “medium,” and [0, 0.8] for “bad” quality), and the other predicted the DSC value of each slice directly. The performances of the method to predict the quality levels were evaluated with quantitative metrics: balanced accuracy, F score, and the area under the receiving operator characteristic curve (AUC). The mean absolute error (MAE) was used to evaluate the DSC value outputs. Results: The proposed methods involved two types of output, both of which achieved promising accuracy in terms of predicting the quality level. For the good, medium, and bad quality level prediction, the balanced accuracy was 0.97, 0.94, and 0.89, respectively; the F score was 0.98, 0.91, and 0.81, respectively; and the AUC was 0.96, 0.93, and 0.88, respectively. For the DSC value prediction, the MAE was 0.06 ± 0.19. The prediction time was approximately 2 s per patient. Conclusions: Our method could predict the segmentation quality automatically. It can provide useful information for physicians regarding further verification and revision of automatic contours. The integration of our method into current automatic segmentation pipelines can improve the efficiency of radiotherapy contouring."
2022,Application of Transfer Learning and Ensemble Learning in Image-level Classification for Breast Histopathology,"Background: Breast cancer has the highest prevalence in women globally. The classification and diagnosis of breast cancer and its histopathological images have always been a hot spot of clinical concern. In Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), traditional classification models mostly use a single network to extract features, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, many networks are trained and optimized on patient-level datasets, ignoring the application of lower-level data labels. Method: This paper proposes a deep ensemble model based on image-level labels for the binary classification of benign and malignant lesions of breast histopathological images. First, the BreaKHis dataset is randomly divided into a training, validation and test set. Then, data augmentation techniques are used to balance the number of benign and malignant samples. Thirdly, considering the performance of transfer learning and the complementarity between each network, VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet201 are selected as the base classifiers. Result: In the ensemble network model with accuracy as the weight, the image-level binary classification achieves an accuracy of $98.90\%$. In order to verify the capabilities of our method, the latest Transformer and Multilayer Perception (MLP) models have been experimentally compared on the same dataset. Our model wins with a $5\%-20\%$ advantage, emphasizing the ensemble model's far-reaching significance in classification tasks. Conclusion: This research focuses on improving the model's classification performance with an ensemble algorithm. Transfer learning plays an essential role in small datasets, improving training speed and accuracy. Our model has outperformed many existing approaches in accuracy, providing a method for the field of auxiliary medical diagnosis."
2018,Breast cancer classification of image using convolutional neural network,"Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been set up as an intense class of models for image acknowledgment issues. CNN is a deep learning model which extracts the feature of an image and use these feature to classify an image. Other classification algorithm needs to extract the feature of an image using feature extraction algorithm like Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix. Convolutional neural network is a class of deep, feed-forward artificial neural networks that have successfully been applied to recognizing image. It is also widely used in video recognition, image classification, recommender systems, natural language processing and speech recognition. In this paper, a dataset of 7909 breast cancer histopathology images acquired on 82 patients are taken. These images are of two different classes benign and malignant. We extract the patches of the image to train the network and finally we give the image as an input to classify the image. Performance of CNN is much better when compared to other reported results on MNSIT dataset using other classification algorithm for classifying an image."
2020,Tumour Stroma Ratio Assessment Using Digital Image Analysis Predicts Survival in Triple Negative and Luminal Breast Cancer,"Simple Summary Tumour stroma is known to predict outcome and play an important role in the growth and spread of solid tumours and their response to therapy. In breast cancer, there is evidence that the tumour stroma ratio (TSR) can predict outcome in aggressive triple negative breast cancer, but its value for the more common hormone receptor positive breast cancer is unclear. Using computerised image analysis and machine learning algorithms, we show that TSR is an important factor in predicting outcome for triple negative disease and hormone receptor positive cancer. However, its influence on good or poor outcome appears to depend on tumour type and the relative predominance of the stromal component. By better understanding the role of the tumour stroma in cancer growth, and its response to treatment, this study may help support the role of TSR as a new prognostic marker for breast cancer to guide clinical decision making. Abstract We aimed to determine the clinical significance of tumour stroma ratio (TSR) in luminal and triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) using digital image analysis and machine learning algorithms. Automated image analysis using QuPath software was applied to a cohort of 647 breast cancer patients (403 luminal and 244 TNBC) using digital H&E images of tissue microarrays (TMAs). Kaplan–Meier and Cox proportional hazards were used to ascertain relationships with overall survival (OS) and breast cancer specific survival (BCSS). For TNBC, low TSR (high stroma) was associated with poor prognosis for both OS (HR 1.9, CI 1.1–3.3, p = 0.021) and BCSS (HR 2.6, HR 1.3–5.4, p = 0.007) in multivariate models, independent of age, size, grade, sTILs, lymph nodal status and chemotherapy. However, for luminal tumours, low TSR (high stroma) was associated with a favourable prognosis in MVA for OS (HR 0.6, CI 0.4–0.8, p = 0.001) but not for BCSS. TSR is a prognostic factor of most significance in TNBC, but also in luminal breast cancer, and can be reliably assessed using quantitative image analysis of TMAs. Further investigation into the contribution of tumour subtype stromal phenotype may further refine these findings."
2019,Stacking Ensemble Technique for Classifying Breast Cancer,"Objectives Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among Korean women. Because breast cancer is strongly associated with negative emotional and physical changes, early detection and treatment of breast cancer are very important. As a supporting tool for classifying breast cancer, we tried to identify the best meta-learner model in a stacking ensemble when the same machine learning models for the base learner and meta-learner are used. Methods We used machine learning models, such as the gradient boosted model, distributed random forest, generalized linear model, and deep neural network in a stacking ensemble. These models were used to construct a base learner, and each of them was used as a meta-learner again. Then, we compared the performance of machine learning models in the meta-learner to determine the best meta-learner model in the stacking ensemble. Results Experimental results showed that using the GBM as a meta-learner led to higher accuracy than that achieved with any other model for breast cancer data and using the GLM as a meta learner led to low root-mean-squared error for both sets of breast cancer data. Conclusions We compared the performance of every meta-learner model in a stacking ensemble as a supporting tool for classifying breast cancer. The study showed that using specific models as a metalearner resulted in better performance than single classifiers, and using GBM and GLM as a meta-learner is appropriate as a supporting tool for classifying breast cancer data."
2021,Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Detection Using Ultrasound Images,"Volunteer computing based data processing is a new trend in healthcare applications. Researchers are now leveraging volunteer computing power to train deep learning networks consisting of billions of parameters. Breast cancer is the second most common cause of death in women among cancers. The early detection of cancer may diminish the death risk of patients. Since the diagnosis of breast cancer manually takes lengthy time and there is a scarcity of detection systems, development of an automatic diagnosis system is needed for early detection of cancer. Machine learning models are now widely used for cancer detection and prediction research for improving the successive therapy of patients. Considering this need, this study implements pre-trained convolutional neural network based models for detecting breast cancer using ultrasound images. In particular, we tuned the pre-trained models for extracting key features from ultrasound images and included a classifier on the top layer. We measured accuracy of seven popular state-of-the-art pre-trained models using different optimizers and hyper-parameters through fivefold cross validation. Moreover, we consider Grad-CAM and occlusion mapping techniques to examine how well the models extract key features from the ultrasound images to detect cancers. We observe that after fine tuning, DenseNet201 and ResNet50 show 100% accuracy with Adam and RMSprop optimizers. VGG16 shows 100% accuracy using the Stochastic Gradient Descent optimizer. We also develop a custom convolutional neural network model with a smaller number of layers compared to large layers in the pre-trained models. The model also shows 100% accuracy using the Adam optimizer in classifying healthy and breast cancer patients. It is our belief that the model will assist healthcare experts with improved and faster patient screening and pave a way to further breast cancer research."
2018,Natural Terpenoids Against Female Breast Cancer: A 5-year Recent Research.,"BACKGROUND The approval of Taxol® in 1993 marked the great entrance of terpenoids in the anti-cancer area and this drug is still highly important in the treatment of refractory ovarian, breast and other cancers. Over decades, other prominent natural terpenoids have become indispensable for the modern pharmacotherapy of breast cancer. However, given the rapid evolution of drug resistance, effective treatments for advanced breast cancers requiring cytotoxic chemotherapy represent a major unmet clinical need. Therefore, innovative agents effective in long-term chemotherapy are urgently needed. OBJECTIVE This review examines recent advances/research about natural terpenoids, and their mechanisms against female breast cancer over the period covering January 1st, 2012 to December 31st, 2016. RESULTS Carcinogenesis constitutes a multistep process wherein each stage is characterized by distinct phenotypic changes. Numerous chemicals recorded in this review have been shown to significantly inhibit proliferation, migration, apoptosis resistance, tumor angiogenesis or metastasis in different breast cancer cells/tumours in vitro and in vivo. Targeting simultaneously several or all these aspects/steps of cancer progression could be an advantage. In line with this, phytochemicals such as thymoquinone (8), costunolide (46), tanshinone IIA (132), triptolide (136), cucurbitacin B (179), celastrol (226) and lycopene (238) had caught our attention. CONCLUSION These compounds appear to be promising to overcome breast cancer treatment failure. However, despite the interesting activities, additional preclinical investigations are needed in further breast cancer cell/tumor models in vitro and in vivo."
2020,MTX-Loaded Dual Thermoresponsive and pH-Responsive Magnetic Hydrogel Nanocomposite Particles for Combined Controlled Drug Delivery and Hyperthermia Therapy of Cancer.,"In recent years, the exploitation of magnetic nanoparticles in smart polymeric matrices have received increased attention in several fields as site-specific drug delivery systems. Here, ultrasonic-assisted emulsion copolymerization of N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPAM) and 2-(N,N-diethylaminoethyl) methacrylate (DEAEMA) in the presence of Fe3O4 nanoparticles was employed to prepare pH- and temperature-responsive magnetite nanocomposite particles (MNCPs). The obtained MNCPs were fully characterized by TEM, DSC, FT-IR, VSM, and XRD techniques. They had an average particle size of 70 nm with a lower critical solution temperature of 42 °C and superparamagnetic properties. In addition, MNCPs were loaded with methotrexate (MTX) as an anticancer drug, and their in vitro drug release was studied in different pH values and temperatures and in the presence of an alternating magnetic field. Noteworthy that the highest rate of MTX release was observed at pH 5.5 and 42 °C. Cell viability of the treated MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line with free MTX, MNCPs, and MTX-loaded MNCPs or in combination with magnetic hyperthermia (MHT) and water-based hyperthermia was comparatively studied. The obtained results showed about 17% higher antiproliferative activity for the MTX-loaded MNCPs accompanied by MHT relative to that of free MTX."
2021,Leveraging information in spatial transcriptomics to predict super-resolution gene expression from histology images in tumors,"Recent developments in spatial transcriptomics (ST) technologies have enabled the profiling of transcriptome-wide gene expression while retaining the location information of measured genes within tissues. Moreover, the corresponding high-resolution hematoxylin and eosin-stained histology images are readily available for the ST tissue sections. Since histology images are easy to obtain, it is desirable to leverage information learned from ST to predict gene expression for tissue sections where only histology images are available. Here we present HisToGene, a deep learning model for gene expression prediction from histology images. To account for the spatial dependency of measured spots, HisToGene adopts Vision Transformer, a state-of-the-art method for image recognition. The well-trained HisToGene model can also predict super-resolution gene expression. Through evaluations on 32 HER2+ breast cancer samples with 9,612 spots and 785 genes, we show that HisToGene accurately predicts gene expression and outperforms ST-Net both in gene expression prediction and clustering tissue regions using the predicted expression. We further show that the predicted super-resolution gene expression also leads to higher clustering accuracy than observed gene expression. Gene expression predicted from HisToGene enables researchers to generate virtual transcriptomics data at scale and can help elucidate the molecular signatures of tissues."
2018,The use of automated Ki67 analysis to predict Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence categories in early-stage breast cancer,"Ki67 is a commonly used marker of cancer cell proliferation, and has significant prognostic value in breast cancer. In spite of its clinical importance, assessment of Ki67 remains a challenge, as current manual scoring methods have high inter- and intra-user variability. A major reason for this variability is selection bias, in that different observers will score different regions of the same tumor. Here, we developed an automated Ki67 scoring method that eliminates selection bias, by using whole-slide analysis to identify and score the tumor regions with the highest proliferative rates. The Ki67 indices calculated using this method were highly concordant with manual scoring by a pathologist (Pearson’s r = 0.909) and between users (Pearson’s r = 0.984). We assessed the clinical validity of this method by scoring Ki67 from 328 whole-slide sections of resected early-stage, hormone receptor-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative breast cancer. All patients had Oncotype DX testing performed (Genomic Health) and available Recurrence Scores. High Ki67 indices correlated significantly with several clinico-pathological correlates, including higher tumor grade (1 versus 3, P<0.001), higher mitotic score (1 versus 3, P<0.001), and lower Allred scores for estrogen and progesterone receptors (P = 0.002, 0.008). High Ki67 indices were also significantly correlated with higher Oncotype DX risk-of-recurrence group (low versus high, P<0.001). Ki67 index was the major contributor to a machine learning model which, when trained solely on clinico-pathological data and Ki67 scores, identified Oncotype DX high- and low-risk patients with 97% accuracy, 98% sensitivity and 80% specificity. Automated scoring of Ki67 can thus successfully address issues of consistency, reproducibility and accuracy, in a manner that integrates readily into the workflow of a pathology laboratory. Furthermore, automated Ki67 scores contribute significantly to models that predict risk of recurrence in breast cancer."
2019,Effective K-nearest neighbor classifications for Wisconsin breast cancer data sets,"ABSTRACT Using machine learning algorithms for early prediction of the signs and symptoms of breast cancer is in demand nowadays. One of these algorithms is the K-nearest neighbor (KNN), which uses a technique for measuring the distance among data. The performance of KNN depends on the number of neighboring elements known as the K value. This study involves the exploration of KNN performance by using various distance functions and K values to find an effective KNN. Wisconsin breast cancer (WBC) and Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) datasets from the UC Irvine machine learning repository were used as our main data sources. Experiments with each dataset were composed of three iterations. The first iteration of the experiment was without feature selection. The second one was the L1-norm based selection from the model, which used the linear support vector classifier feature selection, and the third iteration was with Chi-square-based feature selection. Numerous evaluation metrics like accuracy, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the area under curve (AUC) and sensitivity, etc., were used for the assessment of the implemented techniques. The results indicated that the technique involving the Chi-square-based feature selection achieved the highest accuracy with the Canberra or Manhattan distance functions for both datasets. The optimal K values for these distance functions ranged from 1 to 9. This study indicated that with the appropriate selection of the K value and a distance function in KNN, the Chi-square-based feature selection for the WBC datasets gives the highest accuracy rate as compared with the existing models. Abbreviations: KNN: K-nearest neighbor; Chi2: Chi-square; WBC: Wisconsin breast cancer"
2018,Convolutional Neural Networks for the Segmentation of Microcalcification in Mammography Imaging,"Cluster of microcalcifications can be an early sign of breast cancer. In this paper, we propose a novel approach based on convolutional neural networks for the detection and segmentation of microcalcification clusters. In this work, we used 283 mammograms to train and validate our model, obtaining an accuracy of 99.99% on microcalcification detection and a false positive rate of 0.005%. Our results show how deep learning could be an effective tool to effectively support radiologists during mammograms examination."
2019,"Disease Gene Prediction by Integrating PPI Networks, Clinical RNA-Seq Data and OMIM Data","Disease gene prediction is a challenging task that has a variety of applications such as early diagnosis and drug development. The existing machine learning methods suffer from the imbalanced sample issue because the number of known disease genes (positive samples) is much less than that of unknown genes which are typically considered to be negative samples. In addition, most methods have not utilized clinical data from patients with a specific disease to predict disease genes. In this study, we propose a disease gene prediction algorithm (called dgSeq) by combining protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, clinical RNA-Seq data, and Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIN) data. Our dgSeq constructs differential networks based on rewiring information calculated from clinical RNA-Seq data. To select balanced sets of non-disease genes (negative samples), a disease-gene network is also constructed from OMIM data. After features are extracted from the PPI networks and differential networks, the logistic regression classifiers are trained. Our dgSeq obtains AUC values of 0.88, 0.83, and 0.80 for identifying breast cancer genes, thyroid cancer genes, and Alzheimer's disease genes, respectively, which indicates its superiority to other three competing methods. Both gene set enrichment analysis and predicted results demonstrate that dgSeq can effectively predict new disease genes."
2017,A clinical guide to the management of genitourinary symptoms in breast cancer survivors on endocrine therapy,"There is increasing attention and concern about managing the adverse effects of adjuvant endocrine therapy for women with early breast cancer as the side effects of therapy influence compliance and can impair quality of life (QoL). Most side effects associated with tamoxifen (TAM) and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) are directly related to estrogen deprivation, and the symptoms are similar to those experienced during natural menopause but appear to be more severe than that seen in the general population. Prolonged estrogen deprivation may lead to atrophy of the vulva, vagina, lower urinary tract and supporting pelvic structures, resulting in a range of genitourinary symptoms that can in turn lead to pain, discomfort, impairment of sexual function and negatively impact on multiple domains of QoL. The genitourinary side effects may be prevented, reduced and managed in most cases but this requires early recognition and appropriate treatment. We provide an overview of practical clinical approaches to understanding the pathophysiology and the management of genitourinary symptoms in postmenopausal women receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer."
2020,Delivery of dual miRNA through CD44-targeted mesoporous silica nanoparticles for enhanced and effective triple-negative breast cancer therapy.,"The development of new therapeutic strategies to target triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is in much demand to overcome the roadblocks associated with the existing treatment procedures. In this regard, therapies targeting the CD44 receptor have drawn attention for more than a decade. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) modulate post-transcriptional gene regulation and thus, the correction of specific miRNA alterations using miRNA mimics or antagomiRs is an emerging strategy to normalize the genetic regulation in the tumor microenvironment. It has been acknowledged that miR-34a is downregulated and miR-10b is upregulated in TNBC, which promotes tumorigenesis and metastatic dissemination. However, there are a few barriers related to miRNA delivery. Herein, we have introduced tailored mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs) for the co-delivery of miR-34a-mimic and antisense-miR-10b. MSN was functionalized with a cationic basic side chain and then loaded with the dual combination to overexpress miR-34a and downregulate miR-10b simultaneously. Finally, the loaded MSNs were coated with an hyaluronic acid-appended PEG-PLGA polymer for specific targeting. The cellular uptake, release profile, and subsequent effect in TNBC cells were evaluated. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated high specificity in TNBC tumor targeting, leading to efficient tumor growth inhibition as well as the retardation of metastasis, which affirmed the clinical application potential of the system."
2019,Rod-shape MSN@MoS2 Nanoplatform for FL/MSOT/CT Imaging-Guided Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy,"Rod-shape nanoplatform have received tremendous attention owing to their enhanced ability for cell internalization and high capacity for drug loading. MoS2, widely used in electronic devices, electrocatalysis, sensor and energy-storage, has been studied as photothermal agents over the years. However, the efficacy of rod-shape MoS2 based photothermal agents for photothermal therapy has not been studied before. Here, a near-infrared (NIR) light-absorbing MoS2 nanosheets coated mesoporous silica nanorods with human serum albumin (HSA) modifying and Ce6 loading (MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6) were constructed for combined photothermal and photodynamic therapy. Methods: The near-infrared (NIR) light was used to trigger the synergistic anti-tumor therapy. In addition, breast cancer cell line was applied to evaluate the in vitro anti-tumor activity. The multi-modal imaging capacity and tumor-killing efficiency of the designed nanocomposites in vivo was also demonstrated with the 4T1 tumor-bearing mouse model. Results: These nanocomposites could not only perform NIR light triggered photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT), but also achieve in vivo fluorescence (FL) /multispectral optical tomography (MSOT)/X-ray computed tomography (CT) triple-model bioimaging. What's more, the rod-shape nanoplatform could be endowed with better anti-tumor ability based on the EPR effect and HSA-mediated active tumor targeting. At the same time, the hyperthermia generated by MoS2 could synergistically improve the PDT effect with the acceleration of the blood flow, leading to the increase of the oxygen level in tumor tissue. Conclusion: MSNR@MoS2-HSA/Ce6 proves to be a promising multi-functional nanoplatform for effective treatment of tumor."
2021,Novel ADCs and Strategies to Overcome Resistance to Anti-HER2 ADCs,"Simple Summary A proportion of breast tumors bear the oncogenic transmembrane tyrosine kinase protein HER2. Even though therapies that target HER2 have changed the prognosis and quality of life of patients with HER2+ breast tumors, resistance to those therapies is still an important clinical problem. To improve the management of those tumors, a new category of antitumor agents, antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), has emerged. These agents are created by linking a potent cytotoxic to an antibody that recognizes a membrane protein. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have been approved by the FDA for clinical use and several others are under development. The structure, mechanism of action, and resistance mechanisms to ADCs are reviewed in the present work, as well as potential strategies to overcome resistance to clinically approved anti-HER2 ADCs, including novel anti-HER2 ADCs. Abstract During recent years, a number of new compounds against HER2 have reached clinics, improving the prognosis and quality of life of HER2-positive breast cancer patients. Nonetheless, resistance to standard-of-care drugs has motivated the development of novel agents, such as new antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs). The latter are a group of drugs that benefit from the potency of cytotoxic agents whose action is specifically guided to the tumor by the target-specific antibody. Two anti-HER2 ADCs have reached the clinic: trastuzumab-emtansine and, more recently, trastuzumab-deruxtecan. In addition, several other HER2-targeted ADCs are in preclinical or clinical development, some of them with promising signs of activity. In the present review, the structure, mechanism of action, and potential resistance to all these ADCs will be described. Specific attention will be given to discussing novel strategies to circumvent resistance to ADCs."
2016,Noncoding RNAs in breast cancer.,"The mammalian transcriptome has recently been revealed to encompass a large number of noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) that play a variety of important regulatory roles in gene expression and other biological processes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), the best studied of the short noncoding RNAs (sncRNAs), have been extensively characterized with regard to their biogenesis, function and importance in tumorigenesis. Another class of sncRNAs called piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) has also gained attention recently in cancer research owing to their critical role in stem cell regulation. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) of >200 nucleotides in length have recently emerged as key regulators of developmental processes, including mammary gland development. lncRNA dysregulation has also been implicated in the development of various cancers, including breast cancer. In this review, we describe and discuss the roles of sncRNAs (including miRNAs and piRNAs) and lncRNAs in the initiation and progression of breast tumorigenesis, with a focus on outlining the molecular mechanisms of oncogenic and tumor-suppressor ncRNAs. Moreover, the current and potential future applications of ncRNAs to clinical breast cancer research are also discussed, with an emphasis on ncRNA-based diagnosis, prognosis and future therapeutics."
2019,Integrating Fluorinated Polymer and Manganese-Layered Double Hydroxide Nanoparticles as pH-activated 19 F MRI Agents for Specific and Sensitive Detection of Breast Cancer.,"19 F magnetic resonance imaging (19 F MRI) agents capable of being activated upon interactions with cancer triggers are attracting increasing attention, although challenges still remain for precise and specific detection of cancer tissues. In this study, a novel hybrid 19 F MRI agent for pH-sensitive detection of breast cancer tissues is reported, a composite system designed by conjugating a perfluoropolyether onto the surface of manganese-incorporated layered double hydroxide (Mn-LDH@PFPE) nanoparticles. The 19 F NMR/MRI signals from aqueous solutions of Mn-LDH@PFPE nanoparticles are quenched at pH 7.4, but ""turned on"" following a reduction in pH to below 6.5. This is due to partial dissolution of Mn2+ from the Mn-LDH nanoparticles and subsequent reduction in the effect of paramagnetic relaxation. Significantly, in vivo experiments reveal that an intense 19 F MR signal can be detected only in the breast tumor tissue after intravenous injection of Mn-LDH@PFPE nanoparticles due to such a specific activation. Thus pH-activated Mn-LDH@PFPE nanoparticles are a potential ""smart"" 19 F MRI agent for precise and specific detection of cancer diseases."
2019,Attention by Selection: A Deep Selective Attention Approach to Breast Cancer Classification,"Deep learning approaches are widely applied to histopathological image analysis due to the impressive levels of performance achieved. However, when dealing with high-resolution histopathological images, utilizing the original image as input to the deep learning model is computationally expensive, while resizing the original image to achieve low resolution incurs information loss. Some hard-attention based approaches have emerged to select possible lesion regions from images to avoid processing the original image. However, these hard-attention based approaches usually take a long time to converge with weak guidance, and valueless patches may be trained by the classifier. To overcome this problem, we propose a deep selective attention approach that aims to select valuable regions in the original images for classification. In our approach, a decision network is developed to decide where to crop and whether the cropped patch is necessary for classification. These selected patches are then trained by the classification network, which then provides feedback to the decision network to update its selection policy. With such a co-evolution training strategy, we show that our approach can achieve a fast convergence rate and high classification accuracy. Our approach is evaluated on a public breast cancer histopathological image database, where it demonstrates superior performance compared to state-of-the-art deep learning approaches, achieving approximately 98% classification accuracy while only taking 50% of the training time of the previous hard-attention approach."
2017,Metastasis detection from whole slide images using local features and random forests,"Digital pathology has led to a demand for automated detection of regions of interest, such as cancerous tissue, from scanned whole slide images. With accurate methods using image analysis and machine learning, significant speed‐up, and savings in costs through increased throughput in histological assessment could be achieved. This article describes a machine learning approach for detection of cancerous tissue from scanned whole slide images. Our method is based on feature engineering and supervised learning with a random forest model. The features extracted from the whole slide images include several local descriptors related to image texture, spatial structure, and distribution of nuclei. The method was evaluated in breast cancer metastasis detection from lymph node samples. Our results show that the method detects metastatic areas with high accuracy (AUC = 0.97–0.98 for tumor detection within whole image area, AUC = 0.84–0.91 for tumor vs. normal tissue detection) and that the method generalizes well for images from more than one laboratory. Further, the method outputs an interpretable classification model, enabling the linking of individual features to differences between tissue types. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry"
2020,Predicting Molecular Phenotypes from Histopathology Images: A Transcriptome-Wide Expression–Morphology Analysis in Breast Cancer,"Transcriptome-wide expression morphology deep learning analysis enables prediction of mRNA expression and proliferation markers from routine histopathology whole slide images in breast cancer. Molecular profiling is central in cancer precision medicine but remains costly and is based on tumor average profiles. Morphologic patterns observable in histopathology sections from tumors are determined by the underlying molecular phenotype and therefore have the potential to be exploited for prediction of molecular phenotypes. We report here the first transcriptome-wide expression–morphology (EMO) analysis in breast cancer, where individual deep convolutional neural networks were optimized and validated for prediction of mRNA expression in 17,695 genes from hematoxylin and eosin–stained whole slide images. Predicted expressions in 9,334 (52.75%) genes were significantly associated with RNA sequencing estimates. We also demonstrated successful prediction of an mRNA-based proliferation score with established clinical value. The results were validated in independent internal and external test datasets. Predicted spatial intratumor variabilities in expression were validated through spatial transcriptomics profiling. These results suggest that EMO provides a cost-efficient and scalable approach to predict both tumor average and intratumor spatial expression from histopathology images. Significance: Transcriptome-wide expression morphology deep learning analysis enables prediction of mRNA expression and proliferation markers from routine histopathology whole slide images in breast cancer."
2020,Deep Learning in Selected Cancers’ Image Analysis—A Survey,"Deep learning algorithms have become the first choice as an approach to medical image analysis, face recognition, and emotion recognition. In this survey, several deep-learning-based approaches applied to breast cancer, cervical cancer, brain tumor, colon and lung cancers are studied and reviewed. Deep learning has been applied in almost all of the imaging modalities used for cervical and breast cancers and MRIs for the brain tumor. The result of the review process indicated that deep learning methods have achieved state-of-the-art in tumor detection, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. As presented in this paper, the deep learning approaches were used in three different modes that include training from scratch, transfer learning through freezing some layers of the deep learning network and modifying the architecture to reduce the number of parameters existing in the network. Moreover, the application of deep learning to imaging devices for the detection of various cancer cases has been studied by researchers affiliated to academic and medical institutes in economically developed countries; while, the study has not had much attention in Africa despite the dramatic soar of cancer risks in the continent."
2016,The cancer genetics and pathology of male breast cancer,"Male breast cancer (MBC) is an uncommon and poorly understood disease. Recent molecular studies have shown important differences from female breast cancer which are likely to influence treatment strategies from the current female‐based management towards a more tailored approach. Significantly more MBCs than female breast cancers arise with an underlying germline cancer predisposition, and display a vastly different penetrance compared with females. Furthermore, the genophenotypical association of basal‐like cancer with BRCA1 present in female breast cancer is not observed in male breast cancer. Differences in somatic changes between male and female breast cancer have also been reported, with particular enrichment of PIK3CA mutations and a paucity of TP53 mutations. In general, chromosomal‐based changes, in particular regions of gains, are seen more frequently in male than female breast cancer and methylation is seen less frequently. Clinically, several molecular subtypes with prognostic relevance have been described, including chromosomal complex high and methylation high groups, and subgroups with profiling signatures pertaining to epithelial mesenchymal transition and hormonal therapy insensitivity. As with female breast cancer, attention to male specific multicentre trials based on the individual characteristics are needed, together with establishment of reliable preclinical models to understand more clearly the pathogenesis of male breast cancer and improve the general poor outcome of this disease."
2020,Dual Convolutional Neural Networks for Breast Mass Segmentation and Diagnosis in Mammography,"Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have emerged as a new paradigm for Mammogram diagnosis. Contemporary CNN-based computer-aided-diagnosis systems (CADs) for breast cancer directly extract latent features from input mammogram image and ignore the importance of morphological features. In this paper, we introduce a novel end-to-end deep learning framework for mammogram image processing, which computes mass segmentation and simultaneously predicts diagnosis results. Specifically, our method is constructed in a dual-path architecture that solves the mapping in a dual-problem manner, with an additional consideration of important shape and boundary knowledge. One path, called the Locality Preserving Learner (LPL), is devoted to hierarchically extracting and exploiting intrinsic features of the input. Whereas the other path, called the Conditional Graph Learner (CGL), focuses on generating geometrical features via modeling pixel-wise image to mask correlations. By integrating the two learners, both the cancer semantics and cancer representations are well learned, and the component learning paths in return complement each other, contributing an improvement to the mass segmentation and cancer classification problem at the same time. In addition, by integrating an automatic detection set-up, the DualCoreNet achieves fully automatic breast cancer diagnosis practically. Experimental results show that in benchmark DDSM dataset, DualCoreNet has outperformed other related works in both segmentation and classification tasks, achieving 92.27% DI coefficient and 0.85 AUC score. In another benchmark INbreast dataset, DualCoreNet achieves the best mammography segmentation (93.69% DI coefficient) and competitive classification performance (0.93 AUC score)."

2021,Lobular Breast Cancer: Histomorphology and Different Concepts of a Special Spectrum of Tumors,"Simple Summary Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is a special type of breast cancer (BC) that was first described in 1941. The diagnosis of ILC is made by microscopy of tumor specimens, which reveals a distinct morphology. This review recapitulates the developments in the microscopic assessment of ILC from 1941 until today. We discuss different concepts of ILC, provide an overview on ILC variants, and highlight advances which have contributed to a better understanding of ILC as a special histologic spectrum of tumors. Abstract Invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC) is the most common special histological type of breast cancer (BC). This review recapitulates developments in the histomorphologic assessment of ILC from its beginnings with the seminal work of Foote and Stewart, which was published in 1941, until today. We discuss different concepts of ILC and their implications. These concepts include (i) BC arising from mammary lobules, (ii) BC growing in dissociated cells and single files, and (iii) BC defined as a morpho-molecular spectrum of tumors with distinct histological and molecular characteristics related to impaired cell adhesion. This review also provides a comprehensive overview of ILC variants, their histomorphology, and differential diagnosis. Furthermore, this review highlights recent advances which have contributed to a better understanding of the histomorphology of ILC, such as the role of the basal lamina component laminin, the molecular specificities of triple-negative ILC, and E-cadherin to P-cadherin expression switching as the molecular determinant of tubular elements in CDH1-deficient ILC. Last but not least, we provide a detailed account of the tumor microenvironment in ILC, including tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) levels, which are comparatively low in ILC compared to other BCs, but correlate with clinical outcome. The distinct histomorphology of ILC clearly reflects a special tumor biology. In the clinic, special treatment strategies have been established for triple-negative, HER2-positive, and ER-positive BC. Treatment specialization for patients diagnosed with ILC is just in its beginnings. Accordingly, ILC deserves greater attention as a special tumor entity in BC diagnostics, patient care, and cancer research."
2021,CircRNA ciRS-7: a Novel Oncogene in Multiple Cancers,"circular RNA ciRS-7 (ciRS-7) is a type of endogenous circular RNA (circRNA) with a closed circular structure. Since Hansen first demonstrated that ciRS-7 could serve as a microRNA sponge in 2013, researchers have paid increased attention to this circRNA. ciRS-7 plays a crucial role in regulating RNA transcription, downstream gene expression, and protein production. Moreover, ciRS-7 acts as an oncogene and promotes tumor progression through competitively inhibiting miR-7 in various types of cancers. ciRS-7 has been identified to be closely associated with breast cancer, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, lung cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical cancer, osteosarcoma, melanoma, colorectal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, gastric cancer, pancreatic cancer, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, and cholangiocarcinoma. In this review, we summarize the biological characteristics, molecular mechanisms, and future challenges of ciRS-7 in multiple tumors."
2020,"Detection of masses and architectural distortions in digital breast tomosynthesis: a publicly available dataset of 5, 060 patients and a deep learning model","Breast cancer screening is one of the most common radiological tasks with over 39 million exams performed each year. While breast cancer screening has been one of the most studied medical imaging applications of artificial intelligence, the development and evaluation of the algorithms are hindered due to the lack of well-annotated large-scale publicly available datasets. This is particularly an issue for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) which is a relatively new breast cancer screening modality. We have curated and made publicly available a large-scale dataset of digital breast tomosynthesis images. It contains 22,032 reconstructed DBT volumes belonging to 5,610 studies from 5,060 patients. This included four groups: (1) 5,129 normal studies, (2) 280 studies where additional imaging was needed but no biopsy was performed, (3) 112 benign biopsied studies, and (4) 89 studies with cancer. Our dataset included masses and architectural distortions which were annotated by two experienced radiologists. Additionally, we developed a single-phase deep learning detection model and tested it using our dataset to serve as a baseline for future research. Our model reached a sensitivity of 65% at 2 false positives per breast. Our large, diverse, and highly-curated dataset will facilitate development and evaluation of AI algorithms for breast cancer screening through providing data for training as well as common set of cases for model validation. The performance of the model developed in our study shows that the task remains challenging and will serve as a baseline for future model development."
2022,Breast Cancer Detection and Classification Empowered With Transfer Learning,"Cancer is a major public health issue in the modern world. Breast cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the breast and spreads to other parts of the body. One of the most common types of cancer that kill women is breast cancer. When cells become uncontrollably large, cancer develops. There are various types of breast cancer. The proposed model discussed benign and malignant breast cancer. In computer-aided diagnosis systems, the identification and classification of breast cancer using histopathology and ultrasound images are critical steps. Investigators have demonstrated the ability to automate the initial level identification and classification of the tumor throughout the last few decades. Breast cancer can be detected early, allowing patients to obtain proper therapy and thereby increase their chances of survival. Deep learning (DL), machine learning (ML), and transfer learning (TL) techniques are used to solve many medical issues. There are several scientific studies in the previous literature on the categorization and identification of cancer tumors using various types of models but with some limitations. However, research is hampered by the lack of a dataset. The proposed methodology is created to help with the automatic identification and diagnosis of breast cancer. Our main contribution is that the proposed model used the transfer learning technique on three datasets, A, B, C, and A2, A2 is the dataset A with two classes. In this study, ultrasound images and histopathology images are used. The model used in this work is a customized CNN-AlexNet, which was trained according to the requirements of the datasets. This is also one of the contributions of this work. The results have shown that the proposed system empowered with transfer learning achieved the highest accuracy than the existing models on datasets A, B, C, and A2."
2014,Using high-throughput transcriptomic data for prognosis: a critical overview and perspectives.,"Accurate prognosis and prediction of response to therapy are essential for personalized treatment of cancer. Even though many prognostic gene lists and predictors have been proposed, especially for breast cancer, high-throughput ""omic"" methods have so far not revolutionized clinical practice, and their clinical utility has not been satisfactorily established. Different prognostic gene lists have very few shared genes, the biological meaning of most signatures is unclear, and the published success rates are considered to be overoptimistic. This review examines critically the manner in which prognostic classifiers are derived using machine-learning methods and suggests reasons for the shortcomings and problems listed above. Two approaches that may hold hope for obtaining improved prognosis are presented. Both are based on using existing prior knowledge; one proposes combining molecular ""omic"" predictors with established clinical ones, and the second infers biologically relevant pathway deregulation scores for each tumor from expression data, and uses this representation to study and stratify individual tumors. Approaches such as the second one are referred to in the physics literature as ""phenomenology""; they will, hopefully, play a significant role in future studies of cancer. See all articles in this Cancer Research section, ""Physics in Cancer Research."""
2020,Artificial Intelligence Tool for Optimizing Eligibility Screening for Clinical Trials in a Large Community Cancer Center.,"PURPOSE Less than 5% of patients with cancer enroll in clinical trials, and 1 in 5 trials are stopped for poor accrual. We evaluated an automated clinical trial matching system that uses natural language processing to extract patient and trial characteristics from unstructured sources and machine learning to match patients to clinical trials. PATIENTS AND METHODS Medical records from 997 patients with breast cancer were assessed for trial eligibility at Highlands Oncology Group between May and August 2016. System and manual attribute extraction and eligibility determinations were compared using the percentage of agreement for 239 patients and 4 trials. Sensitivity and specificity of system-generated eligibility determinations were measured, and the time required for manual review and system-assisted eligibility determinations were compared. RESULTS Agreement between system and manual attribute extraction ranged from 64.3% to 94.0%. Agreement between system and manual eligibility determinations was 81%-96%. System eligibility determinations demonstrated specificities between 76% and 99%, with sensitivities between 91% and 95% for 3 trials and 46.7% for the 4th. Manual eligibility screening of 90 patients for 3 trials took 110 minutes; system-assisted eligibility determinations of the same patients for the same trials required 24 minutes. CONCLUSION In this study, the clinical trial matching system displayed a promising performance in screening patients with breast cancer for trial eligibility. System-assisted trial eligibility determinations were substantially faster than manual review, and the system reliably excluded ineligible patients for all trials and identified eligible patients for most trials."
2014,Factors contributing to underuse of radiation among younger women with breast cancer.,"BACKGROUND Evidence-based literature has confirmed the effectiveness of radiation therapy (RT) after breast-conserving surgery (BCS), especially for young women. However, women with young children may be less likely to be compliant. This study explores factors associated with noncompliance of RT among insured young patients. METHOD Using the MarketScan Database, we identified the study cohort as women aged 20 to 64 years who had a BCS between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2009, and had continuous enrollment 12 months before and after the date of BCS. Patients who had any radiation claims within a year of BCS were considered compliant. Adjusted odds of compliance were estimated from logistic regressions for the full sample and age-stratified subgroups. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of study findings. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS Eighteen thousand one hundred twenty of 21 008 (86.25%) nonmetastatic BCS patients received RT. Among patients aged 20 to 64 years, those with children aged 7 to 12 years, those with children aged 13 to 17 years, and those with no children or children aged 18 years or older were more likely to receive RT than patients with at least one child aged less than 7 years (7-12 years: odds ratio (OR) = 1.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.05 to 1.66, P = .02; 13-17 years: OR = 1.41, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.75, P = .002; no children or ≥18 years: OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13 to 1.68, P = .001). Stratified analyses showed that the above association was primarily driven by women in the youngest age group (aged 20-50). Other important factors included breast cancer quality of care measures, enrollment in health maintenance organizations or capitated preferred provider organizations, travelled to a Census division outside their residence for BCS, and whether patients were primary holders of the insurance policy. CONCLUSIONS Competing demands from child care can constitute a barrier to complete guideline-concordant breast cancer therapy. Younger patients may be confronted by unique challenges that warrant more attention in future research."
2019,Label-Efficient Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification,"The automatic classification of breast cancer histopathological images has great significance in computer-aided diagnosis. Recently, deep learning via neural networks has enabled pattern detection and prediction using large, labeled datasets; whereas, collecting and annotating sufficient histological data using professional pathologists is time consuming, tedious, and extremely expensive. In the proposed paper, a deep active learning framework is designed and implemented for classification of breast cancer histopathological images, with the goal of maximizing the learning accuracy from very limited labeling. This method involves manual annotation of the most valuable unlabeled samples, which are then integrated into the training set. The model is then iteratively updated with an increasing training set. Here, two selection strategies are discussed for the proposed deep active learning framework: An entropy-based strategy and a confidence-boosting strategy. The proposed method has been validated using a publicly available breast cancer histopathological image dataset, wherein each image patch is binarily classified as benign or malignant. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with a random selection, our proposed framework can reduce annotation costs up to 66.67%, with higher accuracy and less expensive annotation than standard query strategy."
2021,Impact of Artificial Intelligence Decision Support Using Deep Learning on Breast Cancer Screening Interpretation with Single-View Wide-Angle Digital Breast Tomosynthesis.,"Background The high volume of data in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and the lack of agreement on how to best implement it in screening programs makes its use challenging. Purpose To compare radiologist performance when reading single-view wide-angle DBT images with and without an artificial intelligence (AI) system for decision and navigation support. Materials and Methods A retrospective observer study was performed with bilateral mediolateral oblique examinations and corresponding synthetic two-dimensional images acquired between June 2016 and February 2018 with a wide-angle DBT system. Fourteen breast screening radiologists interpreted 190 DBT examinations (90 normal, 26 with benign findings, and 74 with malignant findings), with the reference standard being verified by using histopathologic analysis or at least 1 year of follow-up. Reading was performed in two sessions, separated by at least 4 weeks, with a random mix of examinations being read with and without AI decision and navigation support. Forced Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (categories 1-5) and level of suspicion (1-100) scores were given per breast by each reader. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the sensitivity and specificity were compared between conditions by using the public-domain iMRMC software. The average reading times were compared by using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results The 190 women had a median age of 54 years (range, 48-63 years). The examination-based reader-averaged AUC was higher when interpreting results with AI support than when reading unaided (0.88 [95% CI: 0.84, 0.92] vs 0.85 [95% CI: 0.80, 0.89], respectively; P = .01). The average sensitivity increased with AI support (64 of 74, 86% [95% CI: 80%, 92%] vs 60 of 74, 81% [95% CI: 74%, 88%]; P = .006), whereas no differences in the specificity (85 of 116, 73.3% [95% CI: 65%, 81%] vs 83 of 116, 71.6% [95% CI: 65%, 78%]; P = .48) or reading time (48 seconds vs 45 seconds; P = .35) were detected. Conclusion Using a single-view digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and artificial intelligence setup could allow for a more effective screening program with higher performance, especially in terms of an increase in cancers detected, than using single-view DBT alone. © RSNA, 2021 Online supplemental material is available for this article.

2020,Breast Cancer Detection Using Machine Learning,"Among different cancers, the most invasive and menacing cancer in women is breast cancer. Women in 140 of 184 countries across the world, continually gets affected by this. It accords for the majority of the cancer victims. The Death rate is around 13 minutes per person. So, earlier detection of this is a blessing in disguise because it increases the chances of successful treatment by providing care at the earliest possible stage. The above idea is the motive for this project. The implementation of this project is done by using Machine Learning techniques on data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository Data Set."
2022,A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Metastatic Cancer Detection,"Cancer has been found as a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes and aims to destroy the body's normal cells abruptly. As a result, it is essential to detect and prognosis the distinct type of cancer since they may help cancer survivors with treatment in the early stage. It must also divide cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups. While realizing efficient detection of cancer is frequently a time-taking and exhausting task with the high possibility of pathologist errors and previous studies employed data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify cancer, these strategies rely on handcrafted feature extraction techniques that result in incorrect classification. On the contrary, deep learning (DL) is robust in feature extraction and has recently been widely used for classification and detection purposes. This research implemented a novel hybrid AlexNet-gated recurrent unit (AlexNet-GRU) model for the lymph node (LN) breast cancer detection and classification. We have used a well-known Kaggle (PCam) data set to classify LN cancer samples. This study is tested and compared among three models: convolutional neural network GRU (CNN-GRU), CNN long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and the proposed AlexNet-GRU. The experimental results indicated that the performance metrics accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity (99.50%, 98.10%, 98.90%, and 97.50) of the proposed model can reduce the pathologist errors that occur during the diagnosis process of incorrect classification and significantly better performance than CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM models. The proposed model is compared with other recent ML/DL algorithms to analyze the model's efficiency, which reveals that the proposed AlexNet-GRU model is computationally efficient. Also, the proposed model presents its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for LN breast cancer detection and classification."
2019,Correlation-Based Ensemble Feature Selection Using Bioinspired Algorithms and Classification Using Backpropagation Neural Network,"A framework for clinical diagnosis which uses bioinspired algorithms for feature selection and gradient descendant backpropagation neural network for classification has been designed and implemented. The clinical data are subjected to data preprocessing, feature selection, and classification. Hot deck imputation has been used for handling missing values and min-max normalization is used for data transformation. Wrapper approach that employs bioinspired algorithms, namely, Differential Evolution, Lion Optimization, and Glowworm Swarm Optimization with accuracy of AdaBoostSVM classifier as fitness function has been used for feature selection. Each bioinspired algorithm selects a subset of features yielding three feature subsets. Correlation-based ensemble feature selection is performed to select the optimal features from the three feature subsets. The optimal features selected through correlation-based ensemble feature selection are used to train a gradient descendant backpropagation neural network. Ten-fold cross-validation technique has been used to train and test the performance of the classifier. Hepatitis dataset and Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset from University of California Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning repository have been used to evaluate the classification accuracy. An accuracy of 98.47% is obtained for Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, and 95.51% is obtained for Hepatitis dataset. The proposed framework can be tailored to develop clinical decision-making systems for any health disorders to assist physicians in clinical diagnosis."
2015,The Experience of Living With Metastatic Breast Cancer—A Review of the Literature,"Women's experiences with metastatic breast cancer have received little research attention. We reviewed published articles (1984–2013) reporting research examining women's experiences of metastatic breast cancer (n = 33). Findings from quantitative studies were categorized into three broad areas: adverse consequences, satisfaction with health care providers, and strategies for living. Themes identified from qualitative findings include living as a social outsider; importance of hope; health and quality of life; positive experiences; experiences at end of life; and strategies for living. More research is needed to explore experiences of subgroups to appropriately respond to women's diverse care needs."
2022,Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Fuzzy Ensemble Modeling Techniques,"Breast cancer has evolved as the most lethal illness impacting women all over the globe. Breast cancer may be detected early, which reduces mortality and increases the chances of a full recovery. Researchers all around the world are working on breast cancer screening tools based on medical imaging. Deep learning approaches have piqued the attention of many in the medical imaging field due to their rapid growth. In this research, mammography pictures were utilized to detect breast cancer. We have used four mammography imaging datasets with a similar number of 1145 normal, benign, and malignant pictures using various deep CNN (Inception V4, ResNet-164, VGG-11, and DenseNet121) models as base classifiers. The proposed technique employs an ensemble approach in which the Gompertz function is used to build fuzzy rankings of the base classification techniques, and the decision scores of the base models are adaptively combined to construct final predictions. The proposed fuzzy ensemble techniques outperform each individual transfer learning methodology as well as multiple advanced ensemble strategies (Weighted Average, Sugeno Integral) with reference to prediction and accuracy. The suggested Inception V4 ensemble model with fuzzy rank based Gompertz function has a 99.32% accuracy rate. We believe that the suggested approach will be of tremendous value to healthcare practitioners in identifying breast cancer patients early on, perhaps leading to an immediate diagnosis."
2016,Cancer Prevention and Interception: A New Era for Chemopreventive Approaches,"At several recent, internationally attended scientific meetings, including the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR)'s “Shaping the Future of Cancer Prevention: A Roadmap for Integrative Cancer Science and Public Health” summit in Leesburg (VA) and the AACR Annual Meeting in New Orleans, the focus on cancer prevention to reduce cancer-related deaths was extensively discussed with renewed attention and emphasis. Cancer prevention should be actively proposed even to healthy individuals, and not just to individuals with high cancer risk. We discuss evaluation of a high cancer risk versus the relatively low risk for side effects of chemopreventive agents. The concept of cancer interception, which is halting transformed cells from becoming malignant cancers, should be adopted for cancer prevention. Potential prevention/interception actions include adopting healthy life style and avoiding carcinogens, repressing inflammation and pathologic angiogenesis, controlling metabolism, correcting insulin resistance and other metabolic alterations. Current drugs with limited toxicity can be repurposed to reduce cancer incidence. Aspirin is now being recommended for the prevention of colorectal cancer and it prevents other neoplasms as well. Metformin and β-blockers could be valuable for reducing pancreatic and breast cancer onset. On the basis of the evaluation of cancer risk, we here call for personalized approaches for cancer prevention and preventive interception and we envisage a list of measures and potential guidelines for preventive and interceptive strategies to reduce cancer burden. Investment into translational research to bring these approaches into public health policies and in the clinic is urgently needed. Clin Cancer Res; 22(17); 4322–7. ©2016 AACR."
2018,Triple negative breast cancer: new therapeutic approaches and BRCA status,"Treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a clinically challenging problem due to intriguing clinical and pathologic features of TNBC and natural or induced resistance to existing therapies. However, a great understanding of features of TNBC particularly associated with BRCA mutations has led to the development of different therapeutic approaches. Besides, identification of TNBC subtypes contribute to investigation of the underlying molecular differences and development of new strategies for the treatment of TNBC patients. In this review, we discussed the definition and characteristic properties of TNBC. We summarized an up‐to‐date description of the reported clinical trials of novel targeted strategies especially PARP inhibitors (PARPi) due to novel and highly potent for the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, we reviewed published studies which investigated the prevalence and types of BRCA1/2 mutation in breast cancer patients to assess and draw attention of association of BRCA status with TNBC. Consequently, the definition subtype of TNBC has important predictive value for the development of new therapeutic agents in the treatment of TNBC. Additionally, the incidence and types of mutations in BRCA‐related pathways may be affected by ethnic origin and contribute to the risk of developing TNBC."
2022,Machine learning and deep learning for breast cancer risk prediction and diagnosis: a Survey,"Breast cancer is the widest spreading disease among women globally. The prevalence rate of breast cancer continued to rise in the last few decades. The mitotic count is a relevant factor for grading invasive breast cancer. Early analysis is an extremely imperative step in treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several skepticisms in detection which employ mammograms. Since it is subject to human prone error, requires more time for completion and the nuclei look similar during all stages of mitosis, automatic detection of mitosis is a good solution to overcome these problems. Detailed analysis of breast cancer normally requires medical images of different methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis largely depend on the experiences of the radiologists, and uncertain diagnosis is quite frequent because of resolution limitations and the concerns of lawsuits arisen from wrong diagnosis or undetected lesions. In this paper, the top methodologies used for mitosis detection are analyzed. There are many algorithms for classification and prediction of breast cancer: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (CART), k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Bayesian Networks (BN). The Wisconsin data set was used to analyze breast cancer as a training set to assess and measure the performance of the three ML classifiers in terms of key frameworks such as accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC. The outcome obtained in this paper provides a critique of the stateofart ML techniques for breast cancer detection. It was also found that the ensemble classifier gives better performance. A preliminary experiment conducted on cascaded RF and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) results in better accuracy than individual classifiers. The paper shows how we can use deep learning technology diagnosis of breast cancer using MIAS Dataset. A deep learning approach is almost used for immense task objective Image processing, Computer Vision, Medical Diagnosis, and Neural Language Processing."
2022,An Approach using Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Prediction,"Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases that causes the death of several women around the world. So, early detection is required to help decrease breast cancer mortality rates and save the lives of cancer patients. Hence early detection is a significant process to have a healthy lifestyle. Machine learning provides the greatest support to detect breast cancer in the early stage, since it cannot be cured and brings great complications to our health system. In this paper, novel models are generated for prediction of breast cancer using Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), Neighbour’s Classifier, Support Vector Classifier (SVC) and Decision Tree Classifier (CART). This paper presents a comparative machine learning study based to detect breast cancer by employing four different Machine Learning models. In this paper, experiment analysis carried out on a Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to evaluate the performance for the models. The computation of the model is simple; hence enabling an efficient process for prediction. The best overall accuracy for breast cancer detection is achieved equal to 94%. using Gaussian Naive Bayes."
2020,Enhanced Artificial Intelligence System for Diagnosing and Predicting Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning,"<p>Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women with cancer. Computer-aided diagnosis is an efficient method for assisting medical experts in early diagnosis, improving the chance of recovery. Employing artificial intelligence (AI) in the medical area is very crucial due to the sensitivity of this field. This means that the low accuracy of the classification methods used for cancer detection is a critical issue. This problem is accentuated when it comes to blurry mammogram images. In this paper, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are employed to present the traditional convolutional neural network (TCNN) and supported convolutional neural network (SCNN) approaches. The TCNN and SCNN approaches contribute by overcoming the shift and scaling problems included in blurry mammogram images. In addition, the flipped rotation-based approach (FRbA) is proposed to enhance the accuracy of the prediction process (classification of the type of cancerous mass) by taking into account the different directions of the cancerous mass to extract effective features to form the map of the tumour. The proposed approaches are implemented on the MIAS medical dataset using 200 mammogram breast images. Compared to similar approaches based on KNN and RF, the proposed approaches show better performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, spasticity, precision, recall, time of performance, and quality of image metrics.</p>"
2022,Support Vector Machine Classifier For Prediction Of Breast Malignancy Using Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset,"Cancer is the world's second largest cause of death. In 2018, 9.6 million people died from cancer. In any medical sickness, breast cancer is one of the most delicate and endemic diseases. This is one of the primary causes of female death in the world. Breast cancer kills one out of every eleven women around the world. ""Early detection equals improved odds of survival,"" says a well-known cancer adage. As a result, early detection is essential for successfully preventing breast cancer and lowering morality. Breast Cancer is a type of cancer that affects one of the most significant issues that humanity has faced in recent decades has been diagnosis and prediction. Cancer detection that is accurate can save millions of lives. Effective technologies for diagnosing malignant breasts aid healthcare providers in diagnosing and treating patients in a fast and accurate manner.

As a result, it is crucial to have high cancer-predictive accuracy to update patient survival criteria and treatment options. Research on machine learning and deep learning, whether using traditional neural networks or using convolutional neural networks, has spread widely and has proven to be a useful technology. It can be very helpful in early detection and prognosis of breast cancer. According to the six machine learning algorithms used in this study and based on the Wisconsin breast cancer diagnostic dataset, they are as follows: Naive Bays (NB), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), we reached an accuracy of 99.1% with SVM that surpassed all competitors and achieved the highest accuracy.

The early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer are made possible by computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) systems that rely on mammograms. This study introduces a unique deep-learning model that uses transfer learning to identify and categorize breast cancer automatically. Deep convolutional neural networks have been shown in several recent studies to diagnose breast cancer in mammograms with performance comparable to or even outperforming that of human experts. In order to extract features from the dataset from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS), the proposed model uses pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures like ResNet50 and Visual Geometry Group networks (VGG)-16.

However, usually they do not take into account the training time and the result of False Negative (FN) while training the model. The main idea of this paper is to compare already existing methods for detecting the breast cancer using Deep Learning Algorithms. Moreover, since the breast cancer is one of the most common lethal cancers and early detection helps prevent complications, we propose a new approach and the use of the convolutional autoencoder.

2022,Deep Residual Learning with Attention Mechanism for Breast Cancer Classification,"Abstract: Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) is a common form of breast cancer that can be found in women. In traditional medical practice, physicians have to manually test and classify the areas which they suspect to be cancerous. However, the literature strongly shows that that the process manual segmentation done by the medical practitioners, is neither time-efficient nor accurate as it depends on their subjective judgment. The model called Residual Attention Neural Network Breast Cancer Classification (RANNBCC) is introduced in this paper to help medical practitioners in the cancer diagnostic process. RANNBCC utilizes Residual Neural Network (ResNet) as an expert-supportive method to help medical practitioners in cancer diagnosis. The implementation of RANN-BCC can support the classification of Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) into non-IDC and IDC without prior information about the presence of a cancerous lesion. The result of classification shows that the RANN-BCC model achieved 92.45% accuracy, 0.98 recall, 0.91 precision, and 0.94 F-score which outperform other models such as CNN, AlexNet, Residual Neural Network 34 (ResNet34), and Feed Forward Neural Network.

2021,"Abstract PO-056: Importance of artificial intelligence, machine learning deep learning in the field of medicine on the future role of the physician","Abstract: There are many ways to define the field of Artificial Intelligence. Here is one way for Artificial Intelligence is ""The Study of the computations that make it possible to perceive, reason, act and predict the future possible outcomes”. Deep learning, which is a popular research area of artificial intelligence (AI), enables the creation of end-to-end models to achieve promised results using input data. Deep learning techniques have been successfully applied in many problems such as arrhythmia detection, skin cancer classification, breast cancer detection, brain disease classification, pneumonia detection, COVID-19 from chest X-ray images, and CT scan images. Almost all hospitals have CT imaging machines; therefore, the chest CT images can be utilized for early classification of diseases. However, the chest CT classification involves a radiology expert and considerable time, which is valuable when any infection is growing at a rapid rate. Therefore, automated analysis of chest CT images is desirable to save the medical professionals precious time that shows the importance of Artificial Intelligence neural networks which is used to classify the infected patients as infected (+ve) or not (−ve). There is a vital need to detect the disease at an early stage and save the patient from the disease. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) are a powerful tool that comes under the platform of Neural Networks – Artificial Intelligence inspired by the human brain, which is extensively utilized for image classification. The hierarchical structure and efficient feature extraction characteristics from an image make CNN a dynamic model for image classification. Initially, the layers are organized into three dimensions: width, height, and depth. The neurons in a given layer do not attach to the entire set of neurons in the later layer, but only to limited neurons of it. Finally, the output is diminished to a single vector of probability scores, coordinated alongside the depth dimension. In a Convolutional Neural Network, the linear function that is used is called a convolutional layer. Each node in the hidden layer extracts different features by using image processing feature detectors. For example, in the first layer, the first node may extract the horizontal edges of an image, the second node may extract vertical edges and etc. These features are extracted using a kernel. The bottom is the original image and the top is the output of the convolutions. It is also worth noting that the output of the convolutions reduces the dimension of the original image, The next step the pooling layer happens tends to be computed after the convolutional layer. The reason why pooling is done is to further reduce the dimensions of the convolutional layer and just extract out the features to make the model more robust. AI could help to rapidly diagnose diseases if proper attention given in collecting the data."
2022,"Deep learning, Artificial Intelligence and machine learning in cancer: Prognosis, diagnosis and treatment","Thus, over the past years, the progress in AI, especially in machine learning and deep learning, has affected the area of oncology. It is in this context that this paper reviews the different changes in technologies for cancer prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment. Some of the ways that AI is helping improve cancer diagnosis and treatment are in the analysis of large clinical and genetic data to provide better forecast accuracy of cancer outcomes, the detailed image analysis to aid early cancer diagnosis, and the use of population, patient, and clinical data to create a custom-made treatment plan. For instance, ML performs well in prognostic evaluations where the algorithm tries to predict diseases’ progress and patients’ survival since it can recognize specific patterns in large databases; on the other hand, DL, particularly CNNs, are precise in interpreting medical images for early diagnosis. Also, AI assists in the application of enhanced therapies for genetic mutations as a form of precision medicine. During treatment strategy development, AI supports oncologists in determining the appropriate radiation doses and the proper combination of drugs; robotic systems increase the accuracy of operations due to AI. However, there is still information privacy and protection, algorithm and model bias, and implementation of AI applications in the context of clinical health care. These issues require special attention for the future development and adoption of AI in oncology. The present uses, advantages, and prospects of AI, ML, and DL in cancer treatment have been described in this paper, along with the focus on the capability of the interventions to transform the course of therapy and actual patient experience."

Yet, i) most of us do not have a formal training on this recent topic; ii) their concepts emerge from several different scientific communities. Thus, deciphering research articles, understanding their underlying assumptions and limits remains quite challenging.To this end, we propose a succinct unified AI and ML glossary dealing with 70 important concepts in non-technical yet accurate terms to help non-AI or non-ML researchers exposed to or entering this emerging field, to better understand, assess and use these concepts in cancer research.</p>"
2023,Predicting Survival of Tongue Cancer Patients by Machine Learning Models,"Tongue cancer is a common oral cavity malignancy that originates in the mouth and throat. Much effort has been invested in improving its diagnosis, treatment, and management. Surgical removal, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy remain the major treatment for tongue cancer. The treatment effect is determined by patients’ survival status. Previous studies have identified certain survival and risk factors based on descriptive statistics, ignoring the complex, nonlinear relationship among clinical and demographic variables. In this study, we utilize five cutting-edge machine learning models and clinical data to predict the survival of tongue cancer patients after treatment. Five-fold cross-validation, bootstrap analysis, and permutation feature importance are applied to estimate and interpret model performance. The prognostic factors identified by our method are consistent with previous clinical studies. Our method is accurate, interpretable, and thus useable as additional evidence in tongue cancer treatment and management."
2022,Cancer Detection using Deep Learning: A Survey,"Cancer refers to a group of diseases that are defined by abnormal cell proliferation and can spread to other parts of the body. Pancreatic cancer originates in the organ behind the lower stomach called the pancreas. The pancreas secretes digestive enzymes as well as hormones that help regulate sugar metabolism. Pancreas cancer is usually discovered late, spreads quickly, and has a poor prognosis. Cancer-specific symptoms may not appear until later stages, and there are no reliable screening techniques to identify high-risk patients. The manual method of checking whether a patient has Pancreatic cancer or not can be time-consuming and it can be tedious because it required experience in Radiologist interpretation; to avoid poor decisions by giving wrong diagnoses to patients. One of the leading causes of cancer death is pancreatic cancer; however, if found early enough, it can be treated. To solve this issue, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been developed, trained, and tested using an abdominal Computed Tomography (CT) scan images dataset to detect pancreatic tumors by many authors. To detect the tumor, it employs image processing techniques of a convolution neural network to detect the tumorous area in the image after it has been pre-processed. It was observed that the technique gives better accuracy in tumor detection.  "
2023,Comparison of machine learning models for breast cancer diagnosis,"<p><span lang=""EN-US"">Breast cancer is the most common cause of death among women worldwide. Breast cancer can be detected early, and the death rate can be reduced. Machine learning techniques are a hot topic for study and have proved influential in cancer prediction and early diagnosis.

2022,Improving Clinical Prediction of Later Occurrence of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning with Grid Search,"ABSTRACT Background It is important to be able to predict, for each individual patient, the likelihood of later metastatic occurrence, because the prediction can guide treatment plans tailored to a specific patient to prevent metastasis and to help avoid under- or over-treatment. Deep Neural Network (DNN) learning, commonly referred to as deep learning, has become popular due to its success in image detection and prediction, but questions such as whether deep learning outperforms other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data remain unanswered. Grid search has been introduced to deep learning hyperparameter tunning for the purpose of improving its prediction performance, but the effect of grid search on other machine learning methods are under-studied. In this research, we take the empirical approach to study the performance of deep learning and other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis (BCM) 5, 10, or 15-years after the initial treatment. We developed DNN models as well as models using 9 other machine learning methods including Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LASSO, Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forrest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), and XGBoost (XGB). We used grid search to tune hyperparameters for all methods. We then compared the deep learning models to the models trained using the 9 other machine learning methods. Results Based on the mean test AUC results, DNN ranks 6th, 4th, and 3rd when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM respectively, out of 10 machine learning methods. The top performing methods in predicting 5-year BCM are XGB(1st), RF(2nd), and KNN(3rd). For predicting 10-year BCM the top performers are XGB (1st), RF(2nd), and NB(3rd) . Finally, for 15-year BCM the top performers are SVM (1st), LR and LASSO (tied for 2nd), and DNN (3rd). The ensemble methods RF and XGB outperform other methods when data are less balanced, while SVM, LR, LASSO, and DNN outperform other methods when data are more balanced. Our statistical testing results show that at a significance level of 0.05 DNN overall performs no worse than other machine learning methods when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM. Conclusions Our results show that deep learning with grid search overall performs at least as well as other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data. It is interesting to note that some of the other machine learning methods such as XGB, RF, and SVM are very strong competitors of DNN when incorporating grid search. It is also worth noting that the computation time required to do grid search with DNN is way more than that required to do grid search with the other 9 machine learning methods."
2023,Marvelous Machine-Learning-Based Breast Cancer Predictive Model,"Abstract: Breast cancer is a major health concern for women all over the world. In order to reduce mortality rates and provide the most effective treatment, Histopathology image prognosis is essential. When a pathologist examines a biopsy specimen under a microscope, they are engaging in histopathology. The pathologist looks for the picture, determines its type, labels it, and assigns a grade. Tissue architecture, cell distribution, and cellular form all play a role in determining whether a histopathological scan is benign or malignant. Manual picture classification is the slowest and most error-prone method. Automated diagnosis based on machine learning is necessary for early and precise diagnosis, but this challenge has prevented it from being addressed thus far. In this study, we apply curvelet transform to a picture that has been segmented using k-means clustering to isolate individual cell nuclei. We analysed data from the Wisconsin Diagnosis Breast Cancer database for this article. in the context of similar studies in the literature. It is demonstrated that compared to another machine learning algorithm, the IICA-ANN IICA-KNN and IICA-SVM-KNN method using the logistic algorithm achieves 98.04% accuracy."
2023,Machine Learning Approaches for MRI Image Analysis-Based Prostate Cancer Detection,"The sooner the patient receives a diagnosis for their condition, the higher their chances will be of surviving it. As is the case with conventional diagnosis, medical imaging is analyzed by trained professionals who look for any signs that the body may be displaying cancerous tendencies. The great quality and multidimensionality of MRI images need the use of an appropriate diagnostic system in addition to CAD tools.

2023,"Classification of Breast Masses Using Ultrasound Images by Approaching GAN, Transfer Learning and Deep Learning Techniques","Breast cancer is a common cause of death among women worldwide. Ultrasonic imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool in breast cancer detection. However, the accuracy of computer-aided diagnosis systems for breast cancer classification is limited due to the lack of well-annotated datasets. This study proposes a deep learning-based framework for breast mass classification using ultrasound images, which incorporates a novel data augmentation technique, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), and Transfer Learning (TL). Automating early tumor identification and classification in breast cancer diagnosis can save lives by improving the accuracy of diagnoses and reducing the need for invasive procedures. However, the limited availability of well-annotated datasets for ultrasound images of breast cancer has hampered the development of accurate computer-aided diagnosis systems. The accuracy of breast mass classification using ultrasound images is limited due to the lack of well-annotated datasets. Conventional data augmentation techniques have limitations in applications with strict guidelines, such as medical datasets. Therefore, there is a need to develop a novel data augmentation technique to improve the accuracy of breast mass classification using ultrasound images. The proposed framework can be extended to other medical imaging applications, where the availability of well-annotated datasets is limited. The GAN-based data augmentation technique and TL-based feature extraction can be used to improve the accuracy of classification models in other medical imaging applications. Additionally, the proposed framework can be used to develop accurate computer-aided diagnosis systems for breast cancer detection in clinical settings. The proposed framework incorporates a deep learning-based approach for breast mass classification using ultrasound images. The framework includes a GAN-based data augmentation technique and TL for feature extraction. The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Breast Ultrasound Images (BUSI) dataset, which includes 1311 images with normal and abnormal breast masses. The proposed framework achieved an accuracy of 99.6% for breast mass classification using ultrasound images, which outperformed existing methods. The GAN-based data augmentation technique and TL-based feature extraction improved the accuracy of the classification model. The results suggest that deep learning algorithms can be effectively applied for breast ultrasound categorization. The proposed framework presents a novel approach for breast mass classification using ultrasound images, which incorporates a GAN-based data augmentation technique and TL-based feature extraction. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms existing methods and achieves high accuracy in breast mass classification using ultrasound images. This framework can be useful for developing accurate computer-aided diagnosis systems for breast cancer detection."
2023,A Study of Breast Cancer Classification Algorithms by Fusing Machine Learning and Deep Learning,"Although breast cancer, with easy recurrence and high mortality, has become one of the leading causes of cancer death in women, early and accurate diagnosis of breast cancer can effectively increase the likelihood of a cure. Therefore, it is particularly important to improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of breast cancer. However, conventional early diagnosis relies on human experience and has a low accuracy rate. Therefore, many researchers have proposed various machine learning methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of prediction. Most of the existing studies around breast cancer classification adopt a single algorithm to fit breast cancer data but ignore the applicability of different breast cancer data features to the model. In this paper, we adopt machine algorithms to strip the features of machine learning methods from the rest of the features and attempt to enhance the model effect by designing deep learning model structures to find the hidden patterns in the rest of the features. In addition, due to strict medical data privacy requirements and high collection difficulty and cost, the model designed in this paper will be trained on a small number of samples. As a result, we attempt to find a minimization model for a breast cancer classification algorithm that features both low cost and high efficiency. At the same time, the deep learning model is further designed to complement the original model when it is possible to introduce complex data indicators. Experimental values show that the design model in this paper performs best not only under limited data and limited indicators but also under limited data complex indicators, demonstrating the effectiveness of the approach of mixed comparison and feature selection of multiple classification algorithms. In summary, the fusion model designed and implemented in this paper performs well in the experiments, and the accuracy of the model test reaches 98.3%."
2022,From machine learning to deep learning: experimental comparison of machine learning and deep learning for skin cancer image segmentation,"Skin lesion analysis is a tedious and challenging task, thus, in this research the suitability of employing machine learning or deep learning approaches for automatic lesion segmentation on dermoscopic skin cancer images is determined. The segmented region can assist clinical experts in understanding the complex lesion structure and internal pattern to find the correct skin cancer type for its early diagnosis and prevention. In this study, I present two methodologies for performing lesion segmentation: machine learning-based optimized K-means with Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the first model, the FA is hybridized with K-means clustering based on the novel average intensity fitness function to optimize the segmentation map. It is observed in the experimental results that the K-means algorithm may lead to poor results due to the wrong selection of initial centroid value, thus FA is hybridized into it to improve the performance. The second model is an enhanced encoder-decoder-based CNN framework implemented in an end-to-end fashion. These two models are compared to understand whether machine learning or deep learning is suitable to perform medical image segmentation based on a few performance metrics such as accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and DICE index. These methods are evaluated and compared on two benchmark datasets provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) named ISIC 2016 [1] and ISIC 2017 [2]. Experimental results showed that the CNN model outperformed the machine learning model with an accuracy difference of 7.98% on ISIC 2016, and 7.32% on ISIC 2017. I concluded from the experimental findings that the deep learning model is more accurate and efficient in segmenting the lesion area as compared to the machine learning model. Thus, findings from this experimental work will be considered for the design of an automatic classification system by incorporating a deep learning-based segmentation approach as a pre-processing step. "
2020,Multi-View Attention-based Late Fusion (MVALF) CADx system for breast cancer using deep learning,"Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women. Early detection can significantly reduce the mortality rate among women and improve their prognosis. Mammography is the first line procedure for early diagnosis. In the early era, conventional Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CADx) systems for breast lesion diagnosis were based on just single view information. The last decade evidence the use of two views mammogram: Medio-Lateral Oblique (MLO) and Cranio-Caudal (CC) view for the CADx systems. Most recent studies show the effectiveness of four views of mammogram to train CADx system with feature fusion strategy for classification task. In this paper, we proposed an end-to-end Multi-View Attention-based Late Fusion (MVALF) CADx system that fused the obtained predictions of four view models, which is trained for each view separately. These separate models have different predictive ability for each class. The appropriate fusion of multi-view models can achieve better diagnosis performance. So, it is necessary to assign the proper weights to the multi-view classification models. To resolve this issue, attention-based weighting mechanism is adopted to assign the proper weights to trained models for fusion strategy. The proposed methodology is used for the classification of mammogram into normal, mass, calcification, malignant masses and benign masses. The publicly available datasets CBIS-DDSM and mini-MIAS are used for the experimentation. The results show that our proposed system achieved 0.996 AUC for normal vs. abnormal, 0.922 for mass vs. calcification and 0.896 for malignant vs. benign masses. Superior results are seen for the classification of malignant vs benign masses with our proposed approach, which is higher than the results using single view, two views and four views early fusion-based systems. The overall results of each level show the potential of multi-view late fusion with transfer learning in the diagnosis of breast cancer."
2023,Deep learning model with L1 penalty for predicting breast cancer metastasis using gene expression data,"Abstract: Breast cancer has the highest incidence and death rate among women; moreover, its metastasis to other organs increases the mortality rate. Since several studies have reported gene expression and cancer prognosis to be related, the study of breast cancer metastasis using gene expression is crucial. To this end, a novel deep neural network architecture, deep learning-based cancer metastasis estimator (DeepCME), is proposed in this paper for predicting breast cancer metastasis. However, the problem of overfitting occurs frequently while training deep learning models using gene expression data because they contain a large number of genes and the sample size is rather small. To address overfitting, several regularization methods are implemented, such as L1 penalty, batch normalization, and dropout. To demonstrate the superior performance of our model, area under curve (AUC) scores are evaluated and then compared with five baseline models: logistic regression, support vector classifier (SVC), random forest, decision tree, and"
2022,Detection of Metastatic Breast Cancer from Whole-Slide Pathology Images Using an Ensemble Deep-Learning Method,"Background: Metastasis is the main cause of death toll among breast cancer patients. Since current approaches for diagnosis of lymph node metastases are time-consuming, deep learning (DL) algorithms with more speed and accuracy are explored for effective alternatives. Methods: A total of 220025 whole-slide pictures from patients’ lymph nodes were classified into two cohorts: testing and training.

The performance of our diagnostic system was verified using 57458 unlabeled images that utilized criteria that included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and P-value. Results: The DL-based system that was automatically and exclusively capable of quantifying and identifying metastatic lymph nodes was engineered. Quantification was made with 98.84% accuracy. Moreover, the precision of VGG16 and Recall was 92.42% and 91.25%, respectively. Further experiments demonstrated that metastatic cancer differentiation levels could influence the recognition performance. Conclusion: Our engineered diagnostic complex showed an elevated level of precision and efficiency for lymph node diagnosis. Our innovative DL-based system has a potential to simplify pathological screening for metastasis in breast cancer patients."

2020,Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms for Breast Cancer Detection,"As per the latest health ministry registries of 2017-2018, breast cancer among women has ranked number one in India and number two in United States. Despite the fact that breast cancer affects men also, pervasiveness is lower in men than women. This is the reason breast cancer is such a vital concern among ladies. Roughly 80% of cancer malignancies emerge from epithelial cells inside breast tissues. In breast cancer spectrum, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) are considered malignant cancers that need treatment and care.

2017,Machine Learning Applications in Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death in women worldwide. Early detection is the key to reduce the mortality rates. Mammography screening has proven to be one of the effective tools for diagnosis of breast cancer. Computer aided diagnosis (CAD) system is a fast, reliable, and cost-effective tool in assisting the radiologists/physicians for diagnosis of breast cancer. CAD systems play an increasingly important role in the clinics by providing a second opinion. Clinical trials have shown that CAD systems have improved the accuracy of breast cancer detection. A typical CAD system involves three major steps i.e. segmentation of suspected lesions, feature extraction and classification of these regions into normal or abnormal class and further into benign or malignant stages. The diagnostics ability of any CAD system is dependent on accurate segmentation, feature extraction techniques and most importantly classification tools that have ability to discriminate the normal tissues from the abnormal tissues. In this chapter we discuss the application of machine learning algorithms e.g. ANN, binary tree, SVM, etc. together with segmentation and feature extraction techniques in a CAD system development. Various methods used in the detection and diagnosis of breast lesions in mammography are reviewed. A brief introduction of machine learning tools, used in diagnosis and their classification performance on various segmentation and feature extraction techniques is presented."

2023,A novel approach for lung cancer detection using deep belief networks,"Due to the increased awareness of lung cancer, researchers have created many algorithms that can recognise the disease in its early stages using a variety of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. Clinicians can manage incidental or screen-found ambiguous pulmonary nodules with the help of machine learning-based models for lung cancer prediction. Such methods might be able to lower the variability in nodule classification, enhance decision making, and eventually decrease the proportion of benign nodules that do not need to be followed. This study proposes a novel lung cancer detection method based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Using ML to classify features in MRI scans, this technology is useful for the early detection of lung cancer. The performance was further enhanced using featureselection methodologies. The images were divided into segments using the FBSO feature selection method, and deep learning techniques were used to analyze the three standard datasets, S1, S2 and S3. In this investigation, 98.9% classifier optimality and 96.7% accuracy were attained. This new approach demonstrated excellent dependability and was found to be the most effective classifier system compared with previous studies."
2023,A bibliometric analysis of using machine learning and artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection,"Prostate cancer stands as one of the most prevalent cancers globally among men, exhibiting substantial geographical variations in both incidence and mortality. While developed countries bear a higher incidence, developing countries grapple with elevated mortality rates. The heightened mortality in the latter is attributed to variations in practices that impede early diagnosis. In this context, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has become increasingly common to improve the diagnostic accuracy of prostate cancer. This review delves into the existing literature to scrutinize the utilization of AI and ML in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. To compile relevant literature, comprehensive searches were conducted on research databases, including SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Google Scholar, to identify articles related to AI or ML (AI/ML) in the diagnosis and management of prostate cancer. Using a screening criterion, 293 reviewed research papers were identified. The two most consistent themes were predictive modeling and the application of AI/ML tools for cancer grading and radiomics. AI and ML enhance diagnostic accuracy by reducing inter-individual variation in Gleason&rsquo;s scoring and complimenting the interpretation of multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI). A few publications reported the use of AI/ML tools that combine histopathology with MRI signals. The literature surveyed indicates a compelling potential for AI and ML to improve diagnostic accuracy in prostate cancer. Emerging literature suggests the use of a combination of demographic features, clinical data, serological markers, pathological grading and radiological factors, and genomic data to propose an accurate, non-invasive diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer."

Unlike classical machine learning approaches which merely focus on enhancing classification efficiency, in this paper the emphasis was made on extracting multiple deep features towards breast cancer diagnosis. To achieve it, in this paper A Deep Hybrid Featured Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Tissue Classification named, AlexResNet+ was developed. We used two well known and most efficient deep learning models, AlexNet and shorted ResNet50 deep learning concepts for deep feature extraction.

2020,Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Analysis for Breast Cancer Histology Images,"Breast cancer is one of the main causes of cancer death worldwide, and early diagnostics significantly increases the chances of correct treatment and survival, but this process is tedious. The relevance and potential of automatic classification algorithms using Hematoxylin-Eosin stained histopathological images have already been demonstrated, but the reported results are still sub-optimal for clinical use. Deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been gaining popularity for analyzing histopathological images.

2021,Lesion Detection in Breast Tomosynthesis Using Efficient Deep Learning and Data Augmentation Techniques,"Digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) is one of the powerful breast cancer screening technologies. DBT can improve the ability of radiologists to detect breast cancer, especially in the case of dense breasts, where it beats mammography. Although many automated methods were proposed to detect breast lesions in mammographic images, very few methods were proposed for DBT due to the unavailability of enough annotated DBT images for training object detectors. In this paper, we present fully automated deep-learning breast lesion detection methods. Specifically, we study the effectiveness of two data augmentation techniques (channel replication and channel-concatenation) with five state-of-the-art deep learning detection models. Our preliminary results on a challenging publically available DBT dataset showed that the channel-concatenation data augmentation technique can significantly improve the breast lesion detection results for deep learning-based breast lesion detectors."
2023,Early breast cancer detection and differentiation tool based on tissue impedance characteristics and machine learning,"During Basic screening, it is challenging, if not impossible to detect breast cancer especially in the earliest stage of tumor development. However, measuring the electrical impedance of biological tissue can detect abnormalities even before being palpable. Thus, we used impedance characteristics data of various breast tissue to develop a breast cancer screening tool guided and augmented by a deep learning (DL). A DL algorithm was trained to ideally classify six classes of breast cancer based on electrical impedance characteristics data of the breast tissue. The tool correctly predicted breast cancer in data of patients whose breast tissue impedance was reported to have been measured when other methods detected no anomaly in the tissue. Furthermore, a DL-based approach using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) effectively classified breast tissue with an accuracy of 96.67%. Thus, the DL algorithm and method we developed accurately augmented breast tissue classification using electrical impedance and enhanced the ability to detect and differentiate cancerous tissue in very early stages. However, more data and pre-clinical is required to improve the accuracy of this early breast cancer detection and differentiation tool."
2023,Breast cancer diagnosis through knowledge distillation of Swin transformer-based teacher–student models,"Abstract: Breast cancer is a significant global health concern, emphasizing the crucial need for a timely and accurate diagnosis to enhance survival rates. Traditional diagnostic methods rely on pathologists analyzing whole-slide images (WSIs) to identify and diagnose malignancies. However, this task is complex, demanding specialized expertise and imposing a substantial workload on pathologists. Additionally, existing deep learning models, commonly employed for classifying histopathology images, often need enhancements to ensure their suitability for real-time deployment on WSI, especially when trained for small regions of interest (ROIs). This article introduces two Swin transformer-based architectures: the teacher model, characterized by its moderate size, and the lightweight student model. Both models are trained using a publicly available dataset of breast cancer histopathology images, focusing on ROIs with varying magnification factors. Transfer learning is applied to train the teacher model, and knowledge distillation (KD) transfers its capabilities to the student model. To enhance validation accuracy and minimize the total loss in KD, we employ the state–action–reward–state–action (SARSA) reinforcement learning algorithm.

2022,Federated Learning aided Breast Cancer Detection with Intelligent Heuristic-based Deep Learning Framework,"Abstract: Breast cancer is the second largest cause of female cancer death and one of the most hazardous diseases that leads to a higher mortality rate. Breast cancer is initialized with the malignant stage, where the abnormal growth of cancerous lumps is initiated from the breast cells. Periodic clinical checks and self-tests assist in early identification and thus progress the survival rates considerably. One of the eminent medical approaches is breast cancer recognition, which offers scientists and researchers huge complications. Breast cancer detection at an early stage permits the patients to receive suitable treatment, which increases the chances of survival. Thus, this paper utilizes a new form of artificial intelligence training called Federated Learning (FL), especially for breast cancer detection, the most eminent technique in the last few years. FL permits individual hospitals to benefit from the rich datasets of multiple non-affiliated hospitals without centralizing the data in one place. Hence, FL utilizes numerous collaborators for building a strong deep-learning model using a large dataset. In this paper, a hybridization of this type of training with a meta-heuristic and deep learning is aimed to be proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. This model encloses diverse steps that include (a) image collection, (b) feature extraction, and (c) classification phase. Initially, the mammogram images related to breast cancer are collected with the concept of FL from the affected individuals. The federated learning helps in reducing the processing time and ensures better performance of the proposed model. The obtained images are considered for the feature extraction phase. The Densenet architecture is used to extract the features used in the classification phase with the help of Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks (E-RNN) for detecting breast cancer. Here, the performance is enhanced by tuning the certain parameter in the RNN network using a hybrid optimization algorithm called Hybrid Dragon-Rider Optimization (HDRO) with Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and Red deer algorithm (RDA) to achieve accurate classification results. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested breast cancer diagnosis model compared with conventional approaches using diverse quantitative measures."

2022,Optimized Stacking Ensemble Learning Model for Breast Cancer Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning,"Breast cancer is the most frequently encountered medical hazard for women in their forties, affecting one in every eight women. It is the greatest cause of death worldwide, and early detection and diagnosis of the disease are extremely challenging. Breast cancer currently exceeds all other female cancers, including ovarian cancer. Researchers can use access to healthcare records to find previously unknown healthcare trends.

It is better to integrate multiple classification algorithms to generate a set of prediction models capable of predicting each class level with 91–99% accuracy. On the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, the suggested OSEL model attained a maximum accuracy of 99.45%, much higher than any single classifier.

The rapid advancement of machine learning, and particularly deep learning, leads to an increase in the medical imaging community’s interest in applying these techniques to improve the accuracy of cancer screening. Most of the data related to diseases is scarce. On the other hand, deep-learning models need much data to learn well. For this reason, the existing deep-learning models on medical images cannot work as well as other images. To overcome this limitation and improve breast cancer classification detection, inspired by two state-of-the-art deep networks, GoogLeNet and residual block, and developing several new features, this paper proposes a new deep model to classify breast cancer. Utilizing adopted granular computing, shortcut connection, two learnable activation functions instead of traditional activation functions, and an attention mechanism is expected to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and consequently decrease the load on doctors. Granular computing can improve diagnosis accuracy by capturing more detailed and fine-grained information about cancer images. The proposed model’s superiority is demonstrated by comparing it to several state-of-the-art deep models and existing works using two case studies. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 93% and 95% on ultrasound images and breast histopathology images, respectively."
2019,Machine Learning Models of Breast Cancer Risk Prediction,"Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women both in the developed and less developed world. Early detection based on clinical features can greatly increase the chances for successful treatment. Our goal was to construct a breast cancer prediction model based on machine learning algorithms. A total of 10 potential clinical features like age, BMI, glucose, insulin, HOMA, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and MCP-1 were collected from 116 patients. In this report, most commonly used machine learning model such as decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and artificial neural network (ANN) models were tested for breast cancer prediction. A repeated 10-fold cross-validation model was used to rank variables on the randomly split dataset. The accuracy of DT, RF, SVM, LR, ANN, and KNN was 0.71, 0.71, 0.77, 0.80, 0.81, and 0.86 respectively. However, The KNN model showed most higher accuracy with area under receiver operating curve, sensitivity, and specificity of 0.95, 0.80, 0.91. Therefore, identification of breast cancer patients correctly would create care opportunities such as monitoring and adopting intervention plans may benefit the quality of care in long-term."

2023,"Breast Cancer Mass Classification Using Machine Learning, Binary-Coded Genetic Algorithms and an Ensemble of Deep Transfer Learning","Abstract: The diagnosis of breast cancer (BC) as early as possible is crucial for increasing the survival rate. Mammography enables finding the breast tissue changes years before they could develop into cancer symptoms. In this study, machine learning methods for BC mass pathology classification have been investigated using the radiologists’ mass annotations on the screen-film mammograms of the Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR). The performances of precomputed features in the BCDR and discrete wavelet transform followed by Radon transform have been investigated by using four sequential feature selections and three genetic algorithms. Feature fusion from craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views was shown to increase the performance of the classifier. Mass classification has been implemented by deep transfer learning (DTL) using the weights of ResNet50, NASNetLarge and Xception networks. An ensemble of DTL (EDTL) was shown to have higher classification performance than the DTL models. The proposed EDTL has area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) scores of 0.8843 and 0.9089 for mass classification on the region of interest (ROI) and ROI union datasets, respectively. The proposed EDTL has the highest BC mass classification AUC score on the BCDR to date and may be useful for other datasets."
2022,A New Hybrid Breast Cancer Diagnosis Model Using Deep Learning Model and ReliefF,"Breast cancer is a dangerous type of cancer usually found in women and is a significant research topic in medical science. In patients who are diagnosed and not treated early, cancer spreads to other organs, making treatment difficult. In breast cancer diagnosis, the accuracy of the pathological diagnosis is of great importance to shorten the decision-making process, minimize unnoticed cancer cells and obtain a faster diagnosis. However, the similarity of images in histopathological breast cancer image analysis is a sensitive and difficult process that requires high competence for field experts. In recent years, researchers have been seeking solutions to this process using machine learning and deep learning methods, which have contributed to significant developments in medical diagnosis and image analysis. In this study, a hybrid DCNN + ReliefF is proposed for the classification of breast cancer histopathological images, utilizing the activation properties of pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) models, and the dimension-reduction-based ReliefF feature selective algorithm. The model is based on a fine-tuned transfer-learning technique for fully connected layers. In addition, the models were compared to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning approaches. The performance of each feature extractor and classifier combination was analyzed using the sensitivity, precision, F1-Score, and ROC curves.

2020,Breast Cancer Mass Detection in DCE-MRI Using Deep-Learning Features Followed by Discrimination of Infiltrative vs In Situ Carcinoma through A Machine-learning Approach,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in women. This aggressive tumour can be categorized into two main groups: in situ and infiltrative, with the latter being the most common malignant lesions. The current use of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) was shown to provide highest sensitivity in the detection and discrimination between benign vs. malignant lesions, when interpreted by expert radiologists. In this article, we present the prototype of a Computer-Aided Detection/Diagnosis (CAD) system that could provide valuable assistance to the radiologist for the discrimination between in situ and infiltrating tumours. The system consists of two main processing levels: 1) Localization of possibly tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) through an iterative procedure based on intensity values (ROI Hunter) followed by a deep-feature extraction and classification method for false-positive rejection; 2) Characterization of the selected ROIs and discrimination between in situ and invasive tumour, consisting of Radiomics feature extraction and classification through a machine-learning algorithm. The CAD system was developed and evaluated using a DCE-MRI image database, containing at least one confirmed mass per image, as diagnosed by an expert radiologist.

2022,Comparing Techniques for Class Imbalance in Deep Learning Classification of Breast Cancer,"<p>Tools based on deep learning models have been created in recent years to aid radiologists in the diagnosis of breast cancer from mammograms. However, the datasets used to train these models may suffer from class imbalance, i.e., there are often fewer malignant samples than benign or healthy, which can bias the model towards the healthy class. In this study, we systematically evaluate several popular techniques to deal with this class imbalance, namely, class weighting, over-sampling, and under-sampling, as well as a synthetic lesion generation approach to increase the number of malignant samples. These techniques are applied when training on three diverse Full-Field Digital Mammography datasets, and tested on in-distribution and out-of-distribution samples. The experiments show that a greater imbalance is associated with a greater bias towards the majority class, which can be counteracted by any of the standard class imbalance techniques. On the other hand, these methods provide no benefit to model performance with respect to Area Under the Curve of the Recall Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), and indeed under-sampling leads to a reduction of 0.066 in AUC in the case of a 19:1 benign to malignant imbalance. Our synthetic lesion methodology leads to better performance in most cases, with increases of up to 0.07 in AUC on out-of-distribution test sets over the next best experiment.</p>"

2020,Classification of Breast Cancer from Digital Mammography Using Deep Learning,"Breast cancer is the most frequent in females. Mammography has proven to be the most effective method for the early detection of this type of cancer. Mammographic images are sometimes difficult to understand, due to the nature of the anomalies, the low contrast image and the composition of the mammary tissues, as well as various technological factors such as spatial resolution of the image or noise. Computer-aided diagnostic systems have been developed to increase the accuracy of mammographic examinations and be used by physicians as a second opinion in obtaining the final diagnosis, and thus reduce human errors. Convolutional neural networks are a current trend in computer vision tasks, due to the great performance they have achieved. The present investigation was based on this type of networks to classify into three classes, normal, benign and malignant tumour. Due to the fact that the miniMIAS database used has a low number of images, the transfer learning technique was applied to the Inception v3 pre-trained network. Two convolutional neural network architectures were implemented, obtaining in the architecture with three classes, 86.05% accuracy. On the other hand, in the architecture with two neural networks in series, an accuracy of 88.2% was reached."

Based on the International cancer research center analysis, the highest number of deaths among women is due to breast cancer. Hence, detecting breast cancer at the earliest may help the oncologist to make appropriate decisions. Due to variations in breast tissue density, there is still a challenge in precise diagnosis and classification. To overcome this challenge, a novel OTDEM-based breast cancer segmentation and classification is proposed with the following four stages: they are, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The input image is passed to the initial stage using the CLAHE filter to enhance the image. Then the preprocessed image is given to the segmentation stage for the image sub-segments by correlation-based deep joint segmentation. Following that, the features such as statistical features, improved LGXP, texton features, and shape-based features are derived from the segmented image. Then the derived features are fed to the ensemble model that includes CNN, DBN, and BI-GRU classifier to finalize the classification outcome. Further, to enhance the performance of the ensemble model, the weight of BI-GRU is optimized via a new algorithm termed SIPOA. This ensures optimal training to make the model more appropriate in its classification process. Finally, the performance of the proposed work is validated over the traditional models concerning different performance measures."

The earlier analysis of BC assists to increase the survival rate of the disease. BC diagnosis on histopathology images (HIS) is a tedious process that includes recognizing cancerous regions within the microscopic image of breast tissue. There are various methods to discovering BC on HSI, namely deep learning (DL) based methods, classical image processing techniques, and machine learning (ML) based methods.

2020,Reimagining T Staging Through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Image Processing Approaches in Digital Pathology,"Tumor stage and grade, visually assessed by pathologists from evaluation of pathology images in conjunction with radiographic imaging techniques, have been linked to outcome, progression, and survival for a number of cancers. The gold standard of staging in oncology has been the TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging system. Though histopathological grading has shown prognostic significance, it is subjective and limited by interobserver variability even among experienced surgical pathologists. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) approaches have been applied to pathology images toward diagnostic-, prognostic-, and treatment prediction–related tasks in cancer. AI approaches have the potential to overcome the limitations of conventional TNM staging and tumor grading approaches, providing a direct prognostic prediction of disease outcome independent of tumor stage and grade. Broadly speaking, these AI approaches involve extracting patterns from images that are then compared against previously defined disease signatures. These patterns are typically categorized as either (1) handcrafted, which involve domain-inspired attributes, such as nuclear shape, or (2) deep learning (DL)–based representations, which tend to be more abstract. DL approaches have particularly gained considerable popularity because of the minimal domain knowledge needed for training, mostly only requiring annotated examples corresponding to the categories of interest. In this article, we discuss AI approaches for digital pathology, especially as they relate to disease prognosis, prediction of genomic and molecular alterations in the tumor, and prediction of treatment response in oncology. We also discuss some of the potential challenges with validation, interpretability, and reimbursement that must be addressed before widespread clinical deployment. The article concludes with a brief discussion of potential future opportunities in the field of AI for digital pathology and oncology."
2021,Artificial intelligence and machine learning methods in predicting anti-cancer drug combination effects,"Abstract: Drug combinations have exhibited promising therapeutic effects in treating cancer patients with less toxicity and adverse side effects. However, it is infeasible to experimentally screen the enormous search space of all possible drug combinations. Therefore, developing computational models to efficiently and accurately identify potential anti-cancer synergistic drug combinations has attracted a lot of attention from the scientific community. Hypothesis-driven explicit mathematical methods or network pharmacology models have been popular in the last decade and have been comprehensively reviewed in previous surveys. With the surge of artificial intelligence and greater availability of large-scale datasets, machine learning especially deep learning methods are gaining popularity in the field of computational models for anti-cancer drug synergy prediction. Machine learning-based methods can be derived without strong assumptions about underlying mechanisms and have achieved state-of-the-art prediction performances, promoting much greater growth of the field. Here, we present a structured overview of available large-scale databases and machine learning especially deep learning methods in computational predictive models for anti-cancer drug synergy prediction. We provide a unified framework for machine learning models and detail existing model architectures as well as their contributions and limitations, shedding light into the future design of computational models. Besides, unbiased experiments are conducted to provide in-depth comparisons between reviewed papers in terms of their prediction performance."
2023,Deep Learning in Automating Breast Cancer Diagnosis from Microscopy Images,"Context: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in women. With early diagnosis, some breast cancers are highly curable. However, the concordance rate of breast cancer diagnosis from histology slides by pathologists is unacceptably low. Classifying normal versus tumor breast tissues from microscopy images of breast histology is an ideal case to use for deep learning and could help to more reproducibly diagnose breast cancer. Since data preprocessing and hyperparameter configurations have impacts on breast cancer classification accuracies of deep learning models, training a deep learning classifier with appropriate data preprocessing approaches and optimized hyperparameter configurations could improve breast cancer classification accuracy. Methods and Material: Using 12 combinations of deep learning model architectures (i.e., including 5 non-specialized and 7 digital pathology-specialized model architectures), image data preprocessing, and hyperparameter configurations, the validation accuracy of tumor versus normal classification were calculated using the Results: The DenseNet201, a non-specialized model architecture, with transfer learning approach achieved 98.61% validation accuracy compared to only 64.00% for the digital pathology-specialized model architecture. Conclusions: The combination of image data preprocessing approaches and hyperparameter configurations have a profound impact on the performance of deep neural networks for image classification. To identify a well-performing deep neural network to classify tumor versus normal breast histology, researchers should not only focus on developing new models specifically for digital pathology, since hyperparameter tuning for existing deep neural networks in the computer vision field could also achieve a high (often better) prediction accuracy."

Our synthetic lesion methodology leads to better performance in most cases, with increases of up to 0.07 in AUC on out-of-distribution test sets over the next best experiment.</p>"
2022,A Novel Machine Learning Method for Mutational Analysis to Identifying Driver Genes in Breast Cancer,"Abstract: Breast cancer has emerged as a severe public health issue and one of the main reasons for cancer-related mortality in women worldwide. Although the definitive reason for breast cancer is unknown, many genes and mutations in these genes associated with breast cancer have been identified using developed methods. The recurrence of a mutation in patients is a highly used feature for finding driver mutations. However, for various reasons, some mutations are more likely to arise than others. Sequencing analysis has demonstrated that cancer-driver genes perform across complicated pathways and networks, with mutations often arising in a modular pattern. In this work, we proposed a novel machine-learning method to study the functionality of genes in the networks derived from mutation associations, gene-gene interactions, and graph clustering for breast cancer analysis. These networks have revealed essential biological elements in the vital pathways, notably those that undergo low-frequency mutations. The statistical power of the clinical study is considerably increased when evaluating the network rather than just the effects of a single gene. The proposed method discovered key driver genes with various mutation frequencies. We investigated the function of the potential driver genes and related pathways. By presenting lower-frequency genes, we recognized breast cancer-related pathways that are less studied. In addition, we suggested a novel Monte Carlo-based algorithm to identify driver modules in breast cancer. We demonstrated our proposed modules’ importance and role in critical signaling pathways in breast cancer, and this evaluation for breast cancer-related driver modules gave us an inclusive insight into breast cancer development."
2023,Breast Cancer Classification Using Deep Learning,"Breast cancer (breast carcinoma) is the most common type of cancer in women, and it is the most dangerous cancer, together with lung cancer. Early detection of this type of cancer is crucial to reduce the mortality rate since breast cancer is often treatable when it is diagnosed early. Cancer starts from a benign state, and without appropriate treatment at the early stages, it becomes malignant. A common way to detect breast cancer is histological biopsy evaluation. Deep learning, as one of the currently most popular computer science research trends, improves neural networks, which have more and deeper layers allowing higher abstraction levels and more accurate data analysis. AI and machine learning have gained a lot of popularity and acceptance in recent years. Here are the top path breaking applications of deep learning in healthcare. Although deep convolutional neural networks as a deep learning algorithm has recently achieved promising results in data analysis, the authors propose a new deep CNN architecture for the classification of breast tumours in ultrasound images."
2022,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Cancer Diagnostic Optimization,"Recently, advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence have made these techniques increasingly prominent. Companies and institutions have begun investing in healthcare research to improve the accuracy of disease prediction because of its widespread popularity and effective pattern detection and categorization capabilities. However, there are numerous difficulties that arise while employing these methods. The lack of a huge data set for medical pictures is one of the biggest challenges. This study aims to provide a reasonable introduction to deep learning in medical image processing, beginning with theoretical foundations and progressing to practical implementations. Deep learning (DL) has become increasingly popular due to a number of computer science discoveries, according to a new study. To get a better grasp of neural networks, the next step was to familiarise ourselves with the principles. That's why convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and deep learning are used. This gives us a better idea of why deep learning is advancing so quickly in so many different application domains, including medical image processing. Key Words: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, CNN, Cancer, Algorithm, ANN."
2022,Breast cancer detection using deep learning and cnn-based model,"The second-most dangerous cancer in the world is breast cancer. Not just in India, but all around the world, breast cancer is the primary cause of death for women. According to the USA in 2011, out of eight one woman had cancer. Inappropriate breast cell division can result in benign or malignant breast cancer. Consequently, this is how breast cancer progresses. Therefore, it is crucial to detect the breast cancer at the early stage. By doing this, many lives can be saved and the sickness can be adequately treated while also being treated as a very serious condition. Breast cancer is most dangerous disease and at present it treated as global disease. Invasive breast cancer will likely affect 246,660 women in the USA in 2016, and 40,450 women will likely pass away from the disease. Mammography continues to be labor-intensive and has acknowledged drawbacks despite its success as a tool for detecting breast cancer, including low sensitivity in women with dense breast tissue. The development of neural networks has been used to breast histopathology images during the past ten years to help radiologists operate more accurately and efficiently. The goal of this study is to use the most recent convolution neural network (CNN) expertise to images of breast histopathology. The first section of the research examines conventional Computer Assisted Detection (CAD) utilising machine learning and a more current CNN-based model for Breast Histopathology Images."
2020,Accurate Detection of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using a Hybrid Model of Artificial Intelligence Algorithm,"Background: Breast cancer (BC) is a prevalent disease and a major cause of mortality among women worldwide. A substantial number of BC patients experience metastasis which in turn leads to treatment failure and death. The survival rate has been significantly increased due to more rapid detection and substantial improvements in adjuvant therapies including newer chemotherapeutic and targeted agents, and better radiotherapy techniques.Methods: In this study, we cross-compared the application of advanced artificial intelligence algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Discrete Cosine Transform, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Multilayer Perceptron, and Ensemble to diagnose BC metastasis. We further combined MLP with genetic algorithm (GA) as a hybrid method of intelligent analysis. The core data we used for comparison belonged to the images of both benign and malignant tumors collected from Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UCI repository.Results: The application of several different algorithms to the collection of BC data indicated that these algorithms have comparable accuracy rate in detecting and predicting cancer. However, our hybrid algorithm showed superior accuracy, sensitivity and specificity compared to the individual algorithms. Two methods of comparison (Cross-Validation and Holdout) were applied to this study which produced consistent results.Conclusion: Our findings indicate that our MLP-GA hybrid algorithm can speed up diagnosis with higher accuracy rate than the individual patterns of algorithm."
2022,Skin Cancer Detection Using Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence: Incorporated model of deep features fusion,"Among the most frequent forms of cancer, skin cancer accounts for hundreds of thousands of fatalities annually throughout the globe. It shows up as excessive cell proliferation on the skin. The likelihood of a successful recovery is greatly enhanced by an early diagnosis. More than that, it might reduce the need for or the frequency of chemical, radiological, or surgical treatments. As a result, savings on healthcare expenses will be possible. Dermoscopy, which examines the size, form, and color features of skin lesions, is the first step in the process of detecting skin cancer and is followed by sample and lab testing to confirm any suspicious lesions. Deep learning AI has allowed for significant progress in image-based diagnostics in recent years. Deep neural networks known as convolutional neural networks (CNNs or ConvNets) are essentially an extended form of multi-layer perceptrons. In visual imaging challenges, CNNs have shown the best accuracy. The purpose of this research is to create a CNN model for the early identification of skin cancer. The backend of the CNN classification model will be built using Keras and Tensorflow in Python. Different network topologies, such as Convolutional layers, Dropout layers, Pooling layers, and Dense layers, are explored and tried out throughout the model's development and validation phases. Transfer Learning methods will also be included in the model to facilitate early convergence. The dataset gathered from the ISIC challenge archives will be used to both tests and train the model."
2020,Personalized drug-response prediction model for lung cancer patients using machine learning,"Lung cancer caused by mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a major cause of cancer deaths worldwide. EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed, and have shown increased survival rates and quality of life in clinical studies. However, drug resistance is a major issue, and treatment efficacy is lost after about an year. Therefore, predicting the response to targeted therapies for lung cancer patients is a significant research problem. In this work, we address this issue and propose a personalized model to predict the drug-response of lung cancer patients. This model uses clinical information, geometrical properties of the drug binding site, and the binding free energy of the drug-protein complex. The proposed model achieves state of the art performance with 97.5% accuracy, 100% recall, 95% precision, and 96.3% F1-score with a random forest classifier. This model can also be tested on other types of cancer and diseases, and we believe that it may help in taking optimal clinical decisions for treating patients with targeted therapies"
2022,Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Methods to Predict the Complexity of Breast Cancer Cases,"In many countries, the management of cancer patients must be discussed in multidisciplinary tumor boards (MTBs). These meetings have been introduced to provide a collaborative and multidisciplinary approach to cancer care. However, the benefits of MTBs are now being challenged because there are a lot of cases and not enough time to discuss all the of them. During the evaluation of the guideline-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) of the DESIREE project, we found that for some clinical cases, the system did not produce recommendations. We assumed that these cases were complex clinical cases and needed deeper MTB discussions. In this work, we trained and tested several machine learning and deep learning algorithms on a labelled sample of 298 breast cancer patient summaries, to predict the complexity of a breast cancer clinical case. XGboost and multi-layer perceptron were the models with the best result, with an F1 score of 83%."
2023,Extreme learning machine algorithm‐based model for lung cancer classification from histopathological real‐time images,"Abstract: In the present scenario, developing an automatic and credible diagnostic system to analyze lung cancer type, stage, and level from computed tomography (C.T.) images is a very challenging task, even for experienced pathologists, due to the nonuniform illumination and artifacts. The nonuniform illumination and artifacts are the low‐frequency changes in image intensity that arise from the sensor and the person's movement while recording the C.T. scanned images. Although numerous machine learning techniques are used to improve the effectiveness of automatic lung cancer diagnostic systems, the classification accuracy of these systems still needs significant improvement to satisfy the real‐time requirement of the diagnostic situations. A new extreme learning machine (ELM) algorithm‐based model (hereafter called XlmNet) is proposed to classify the histopathology scans effectively. XlmNet utilizes The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) dataset. After data collection, the initial stage in XlmNet is preprocessing, including noise removal, histogram equalization, and quality‐improved image. The enhanced Profuse Clustering (EPC) method is implemented for segmenting the affected regions from C.T. scans by image segment using superpixel clustering. The statistical attributes are extracted by using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). ELM classifier helps in classifying the lung nodules. The empirical results of the XlmNet model are related to some advanced classifiers concerning performance metrics. The evaluations of XlmNet on the TCIA dataset reveal that XlmNet outperforms other classification networks with the Accuracy of 0.965, a sensitivity of 0.964, a specificity of 0.865, a precision of 0.962, a Jaccard similarity score (JSS) of 0.95."
2023,Deep Learning Model Aids Breast Cancer Detection,"Breast cancer, a lumpy nodule or granular calcified tissue caused by cancerous changes in chest tissue, has become one of the most prevalent cancers. Due to the location and structure of the tumor, it can be detected directly by ultrasound or X-ray and is less likely to spread to other parts of the body than tumors in other parts of the body. Considering the huge number of sick people, the resources required for a full census would be enormous, but thanks to the rapid development of medical image processing technology in recent years, assisted diagnosis through deep learning models has gradually become more widely accepted. For detection models, higher accuracy means lower misdiagnosis rates and timely treatment for patients. Therefore, in this paper, we first specify the diagnose as a binary classification problem and then introduce a new pooling scheme and training method to achieve better results compared to the traditional network backbone in the past."
2021,Connected-UNets: a deep learning architecture for breast mass segmentation,"Abstract: Breast cancer analysis implies that radiologists inspect mammograms to detect suspicious breast lesions and identify mass tumors. Artificial intelligence techniques offer automatic systems for breast mass segmentation to assist radiologists in their diagnosis. With the rapid development of deep learning and its application to medical imaging challenges, UNet and its variations is one of the state-of-the-art models for medical image segmentation that showed promising performance on mammography. In this paper, we propose an architecture, called Connected-UNets, which connects two UNets using additional modified skip connections. We integrate Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) in the two standard UNets to emphasize the contextual information within the encoder–decoder network architecture. We also apply the proposed architecture on the Attention UNet (AUNet) and the Residual UNet (ResUNet). We evaluated the proposed architectures on two publically available datasets, the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INbreast, and additionally on a private dataset. Experiments were also conducted using additional synthetic data using the cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) model between two unpaired datasets to augment and enhance the images. Qualitative and quantitative results show that the proposed architecture can achieve better automatic mass segmentation with a high Dice score of 89.52%, 95.28%, and 95.88% and Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 80.02%, 91.03%, and 92.27%, respectively, on CBIS-DDSM, INbreast, and the private dataset."
2023,Artificial intelligence based prediction on lung cancer risk factors using deep learning,"<span lang=""EN-US"">In this proposed work, we identified the significant research issues on lung cancer risk factors. Capturing and defining symptoms at an early stage is one of the most difficult phases for patients. Based on the history of patients records, we reviewed a number of current research studies on lung cancer and its various stages. We identified that lung cancer is one of the significant research issues in predicting the early stages of cancer disease. This research aimed to develop a model that can detect lung cancer with a remarkably high level of accuracy using the deep learning approach (convolution neural network). This method considers and resolves significant gaps in previous studies. We compare the accuracy levels and loss values of our model with VGG16, InceptionV3, and Resnet50. We found that our model achieved an accuracy of 94% and a minimum loss of 0.1%. Hence physicians can use our convolution neural network models for predicting lung cancer risk factors in the real world. Moreover, this investigation reveals that squamous cell carcinoma, normal, adenocarcinoma, and large cell carcinoma are the most significant risk factors. In addition, the remaining attributes are also crucial for achieving the best performance.</span>"
2021,BCM-VEMT: Classification of Brain Cancer from MRI Images using Deep Learning and Ensemble of Machine Learning Techniques,"Abstract: Brain Cancer is quite possibly the most driving reason for death in recent years. Appropriate diagnosis of the cancer type empowers the specialists to make the right choice of treatment, decision and to save the patient's life. It goes no saying the importance of a computer-aided diagnosis system with image processing that can classify the tumor types correctly. In this paper, an enhanced approach has been proposed, that can classify brain tumor types from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using deep learning and an ensemble of Machine Learning Algorithms. The system named BCM-VEMT can classify among four different classes that consist of three categories of Brain Cancers (Glioma, Meningioma, and Pituitary) and Non-Cancerous which means Normal type. A Convolutional Neural Network is developed to extract deep features from the MRI images. Then these extracted deep features are fed into multi-class ML classifiers to classify among these cancer types. Finally, a weighted average ensemble of classifiers is used to achieve better performance by combining the results of each ML classifier. The dataset of the system has a total of 3787 MRI images of four classes. BCM-VEMT has achieved better performance with 97.90% accuracy for the Glioma class, 98.94% accuracy for the Meningioma class, 98.00% accuracy for the Normal class, 98.92% accuracy for the Pituitary class, and overall accuracy of 98.42%. BCM-VEMT can have a great significance in classifying Brain Cancer types."
2020,A New Deep Learning Model Selection Method for Colorectal Cancer Classification,"<p>Deep learning is one of the most commonly used techniques in computer-aided diagnosis systems. Their exploitation for histopathological image analysis is important because of the complex morphology of whole slide images. However, the main limitation of these methods is the restricted number of available medical images, which can lead to an overfitting problem. Many studies have suggested the use of static ensemble learning methods to address this issue. This article aims to propose a new dynamic ensemble deep learning method. First, it generates a set of models based on the transfer learning strategy from deep neural networks. Then, the relevant subset of models is selected by the particle swarm optimization algorithm and combined by voting or averaging methods. The proposed approach was tested on a histopathological dataset for colorectal cancer classification, based on seven types of CNNs. The method has achieved accurate results (94.52%) by the Resnet121 model and the voting strategy, which provides important insights into the efficiency of dynamic ensembling in deep learning.</p>"

2023,Deep learning applications to breast cancer detection by magnetic resonance imaging: a literature review,"Abstract: Deep learning analysis of radiological images has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes. This paper systematically reviewed the current literature on deep learning detection of breast cancer based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The literature search was performed from 2015 to Dec 31, 2022, using Pubmed. Other database included Semantic Scholar, ACM Digital Library, Google search, Google Scholar, and pre-print depositories (such as Research Square). Articles that were not deep learning (such as texture analysis) were excluded. PRISMA guidelines for reporting were used. We analyzed different deep learning algorithms, methods of analysis, experimental design, MRI image types, types of ground truths, sample sizes, numbers of benign and malignant lesions, and performance in the literature. We discussed lessons learned, challenges to broad deployment in clinical practice and suggested future research directions."

2023,Creating a Novel Deep Learning Pipeline to Generate and Screen Molecules for Hormone-Positive Breast Cancer Treatment,"<p>There has been a lot of research done into the implementation of neural networks in the bioinformatics space, specifically with respect to drug discovery. Although there have been many promising steps taken in this direction, there is still a large amount of research yet to be done in this field. In this paper, we design a novel architecture that aims to generate novel molecules that will treat hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer disease. These molecules are aimed to inhibit aromatase, CDK4, CDK6, PI3K, and mTOR proteins. To do this, we used a natural language processor based variational autoencoder. Our model is trained on the ZINC open-source dataset due to its library of 250k drug molecules. To generate our molecules we compiled a test set of about 68 molecules that were already proven to bind to our mentioned target proteins. To measure the initial viability of our generated molecules we used RDKit’s quantitative estimated drug-likeness score, which will help provide insight into the drug-likeness of our generated data. Supplementary models helped predict other properties of our generated molecules, specifically solubility, synthetic accessibility, and toxicity to further heighten our screening process. We used the AutoDock Vina framework to predict the Gibbs Free Energy Score between the molecule and the desired target enzymes. Our experimentation was able to expand and improve upon a previous solubility prediction architecture to procure more accurate results on both solubility and synthetic accessibility of molecules. The goal of our research is to develop a novel high-throughput process to generate and screen for hormone-positive breast cancer drug molecules that can be feasible in the real world. Since the drug discovery space is so large (approximately 10<sup>60</sup> molecules), neural networks are a valuable tool to help cut down the time and cost it takes to find these molecules. Through our experimentation, we were able to add a novel improvement to a working VAE framework by refining certain layers of the network’s decoder, leading to the generation of three molecules that passed our screening process and have high viability to be successful in suppressing hormone-positive breast cancer tumor growth.</p>"
2021,Classification of Cervical Cancer Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning Approach,"Abstract: Human and material resources are scarce in countries such as developing countries with a high rate of cervical cancer. In such an environment, the introduction of automatic diagnostic technology that can replace specialists is urgent. Finding best method of the known methods can accelerate the adoption of computer-aided diagnostic tools for cervical cancer. In this paper, we would like to investigate which method, machine learning or deep learning, has higher classification performance in diagnosing cervical cancer.Using 4,119 sheets, cervical cancer was classified to positive or negative class using Resnet-50 for deep learning, XGB, SVM and RF for mechine learning. In both experiments, square images which of vaginal wall regions are cut were used. In the machine learning, 10 major features were extracted from a total of 300 features.All tests were validated by 5-fold cross-validation, and receiver operating characteristics(ROC) analysis yielded the following AUC: Resnet-50 0.97(CI 95% 0.949-0.976), XGB 0.82(CI 95% 0.797-0.851), SVM 0.84(CI 95% 0.801-0.854), RF 0.79(CI 95% 0.804-0.856). Deep learning was 0.15 point higher (p < 0.05) than the average (0.82) of three machine learning methods.We propose an better algorithm among the previously known or newly proposed algorithms for diagnosis of cervical cancer using cervicography images."
2022,Attention Cost-Sensitive Deep Learning-Based Approach for Skin Cancer Detection and Classification,"Deep learning-based models have been employed for the detection and classification of skin diseases through medical imaging. However, deep learning-based models are not effective for rare skin disease detection and classification. This is mainly due to the reason that rare skin disease has very a smaller number of data samples. Thus, the dataset will be highly imbalanced, and due to the bias in learning, most of the models give better performances. The deep learning models are not effective in detecting the affected tiny portions of skin disease in the overall regions of the image. This paper presents an attention-cost-sensitive deep learning-based feature fusion ensemble meta-classifier approach for skin cancer detection and classification. Cost weights are included in the deep learning models to handle the data imbalance during training. To effectively learn the optimal features from the affected tiny portions of skin image samples, attention is integrated into the deep learning models. The features from the finetuned models are extracted and the dimensionality of the features was further reduced by using a kernel-based principal component (KPCA) analysis. The reduced features of the deep learning-based finetuned models are fused and passed into ensemble meta-classifiers for skin disease detection and classification. The ensemble meta-classifier is a two-stage model. The first stage performs the prediction of skin disease and the second stage performs the classification by considering the prediction of the first stage as features. Detailed analysis of the proposed approach is demonstrated for both skin disease detection and skin disease classification. The proposed approach demonstrated an accuracy of 99% on skin disease detection and 99% on skin disease classification. In all the experimental settings, the proposed approach outperformed the existing methods and demonstrated a performance improvement of 4% accuracy for skin disease detection and 9% accuracy for skin disease classification. The proposed approach can be used as a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) tool for the early diagnosis of skin cancer detection and classification in healthcare and medical environments. The tool can accurately detect skin diseases and classify the skin disease into their skin disease family."
2023,Breast Masses Segmentation: A Framework of Skip Dilated Semantic Network and Machine Learning,"Many medical specialists used Computer Aided Diagnostic (CAD) systems as a second opinion to detect breast masses. The poor visualization of mass images makes it difficult to identify precisely. To segment the lesions from the mammograms is a difficult task due to different shapes, sizes, and locations of the masses. The motivation of this study is to develop a method that can segment breast mass lesions from mammogram images. The objective is to perform the segmentation of the breast mass mammogram images more precisely at an early stage. Breast mass segmentation is always a basic requirement in computer-aided diagnosis systems. In this study segmentation of the masses abnormalities from the mammogram images is performed by using the Skipping Dilated semantic segmentation approach. The study uses class weights and Dilation factor using semantic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It overcomes the class misbalance in tumors and background class, that affect the mean Intersection over Union (MIOU), and weighted-IOU (WIOU) by using class weights. Secondly, dilation convolution magnifies the receptive field exposure that enriches the convolutional operation with context attentiveness. Two public datasets of mammography INbreast and CBIS-DDSM are used. The WIOU of Skipping Dilated Semantic CNN for INbreast is 98.51% and CBIS-DDSM is 94.82% achieved."
2021,Prognosis and Prediction of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning and Ensemble-Based Training Model,"Abstract: There has been an increase in occurrence of human diseases all over the world. Among those, Breast Cancer has increased with an alarming rate in the past decade and this trend of increase would continue to grow. Now, there is a need for efficient text analytics and feature extraction tools to assist classifying, sharing and retrieving the information on human diseases in general and Breast Cancer in particular. In light of above, the present study has been undertaken with the objective to provide a comparative analysis of different classifiers on Breast Cancer dataset, and to propose a new ensemble training method of Machine Learning Classification. Here, machine learning models (such as K-Nearest Neighbour, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boost, Support Vector Machine) and deep learning classifiers (such as Multi-Layer Feed Forward Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Long Short Term Memory) have been applied on Breast Cancer dataset. An Ensemble Learning model for Prediction is proposed to classify the results among different classifiers. Finally, the Voting Ensemble is implemented to find out the optimal classifier for prediction of Breast Cancer. The results have been computed using the evaluation parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall and Specificity. The confusion matrix drawn on the basis of evaluation parameters provides more emphasis on predicted and actual instances. Performance Evaluation for various machine learning models is computed. Results of this investigation concludes that Voting Ensemble outperforms other machine learning models. The prediction using Voting Ensemble resulted in an accuracy rate of 97.9 per cent, precision of 96.77 per cent and recall of 100 per cent."
2023,Research on Breast Cancer Classification and Prediction Model Based on Principal Component Analysis and Machine Learning,"In recent years, breast cancer has become one of the biggest threats to women's health, accounting for the majority of cancer deaths among women. Because early treatment of breast cancer has a great effect on the recovery of breast cancer, the diagnosis of breast cancer is particularly important. Machine learning, as the most popular method, is also used for model construction in this field. This study is based on data from breast tumors, which contain 10 morphological features of breast tumor nucleus. In this study, homogenization, standardization and feature selection were used to process the data and KNN algorithm was used to construct the classification prediction model, with principal component analysis (PCA) used to optimize the model. Finally, the original 30 variables were reduced to 3 variables and the model parameters were adjusted in order to achieve the best model with the accuracy of 98.54%. The final model achieves the highest operating efficiency and accuracy. In this study, through the visualization of PCA and the comparison of different models, the classification effect of the final model can be the best.

Classifications of pathological images are important for its diagnosis and prognosis. However, the existing computational methods can sometimes hardly meet the accuracy requirement of clinical applications, due to uneven color distribution and subtle difference in features. Methods: In this study, a novel classification method DeepBC was proposed for classifying the pathological images of breast cancer, based on the deep convolution neural networks. DeepBC integrated Inception, ResNet, and AlexNet, extracted features from images, and classified images of benign and malignant tissues. Results: Additionally, complex tests were performed on the existing benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of DeepBC. The evaluation results showed that, DeepBC achieved 92% and 96.43% accuracy rates in classifying patients and images, respectively, with the F1-score of 97.38%, which better than the state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: These findings indicated that, the model had favorable robustness and generalization, and was advantageous in the clinical classifications of breast cancer."
2022,A Hybrid Deep Learning Methodology for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Images,"Abstract: Today, breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer in women. Precise diagnosis of cancerous tissues based on images is essential in disease treatment before the disease progression. Although there are several image techniques for diagnosing, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contains extensive clinical information which usable with other image modalities such as mammography and ultrasound. In this study, the hybrid of an autoencoder network with ResNet architecture was proposed to significantly improve classification accuracy to diagnose breast cancer lesions into two categories: benign and malignant in MR images. Using the MR breast cancer images of the QIN-Breast database, the results present the employment of an autoencoder as a preprocessor can enhance the efficiency of CNN and ultimately lead to an accurate diagnosis of benign and malignant tissues by 97.65%. The proposed method significantly improved the classification from the point of view of speed, accuracy, and precision. This cancerous tissue classification was employed only using MR images without manual segmentation and feature extraction."
2023,Detection of Breast Cancer Using Deep Learning Techniques,"Evaluation of Histopathology images are a vital approach that is used for the breast cancer detection. To build up the efficiency of breast cancer detection and to reduce the burden of doctors and specialists, we layout various Deep Learning algorithms to recognize most cancers with the usage of histopathology scans. This paper follows several deep learning models like Convolutional Neural network (CNN) and Vgg16 for the recognition method. The dataset we used for class manner is Breast Histopathology Images which contain positive and negative images. We examined breast Histopathology images of 2,77,524 patients of which 198,748 images are IDC (-) and 78,786 images are IDC (+). This shows the deep learning algorithms can greatly facilitate the breast cancer detection, improving the accuracy and speed of detection. One of the most common cancers is Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). To determine the aggressiveness score to whole-mount specimen, doctors typically focus on areas containing IDC. Therefore, one of the common pre-processing steps for automatic aggressive categorization is to identify the exact region of IDC along the mounting side."

Deep learning approaches have gained a tremendous recognition in the areas of object detection, segmentation, image recognition, and computer vision. Precise and premature detection and classification of lesions is very critical for increasing the survival rates of patients. Recent CNN models are designed to enhance radiologists' understandings to identify even the least possible lesions at the very early stage."
2022,Deep-learning and transfer learning identify new breast cancer survival subtypes from single-cell imaging data,"STATEMENT OF TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: Our findings from a breast cancer population cohort demonstrate the clinical utility of using the single-cell level imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data as a new type of patient prognosis prediction marker. Not only did the prognosis prediction achieve high accuracy with a Concordance index score greater than 0.8, it also enabled the discovery of seven survival subtypes that are more distinguishable than the molecular subtypes. These new subtypes present distinct profiles of epithelial, immune, fibroblast cells, and their interactions. Most importantly, this study identified and validated atypical subpopulations of TNBC patients with moderate prognosis (GATA3 over-expression) and Luminal A patients with poor prognosis (KRT6 and ACTA2 over-expression and CDH1 under-expression), using multiple large breast cancer cohorts."
2022,Predictive Cancer Detection and Treatment Using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence,"Machine Learning is a field of Computer Science used to derive meaningful insights through Big Data. With emerging technology, Machine Learning can now be used to predict almost any result according to any functionality. Machine Learning studies underlying patterns in the data and thus derives a suitable model. Medical Sciences face new challenges every day for example, illiteracy in patients about the actual diseases they are facing, taking further steps in treatments, medications needed to treat diseases and so on. This project will help patients to detect cancer and guide patients to proceed with the correct treatments through the mere input of symptoms faced, medical histories if any, current medical reports like blood, pathology, heart, ECG, etc. The model will thus be able to represent itself just how a doctor can, to patients."
2021,PathologyGAN: Learning deep representations of cancer tissue,"Histopathological images of tumours contain abundant information about how tumours grow and how they interact with their micro-environment. Better understanding of tissue phenotypes in these images could reveal novel determinants of pathological processes underlying cancer, and in turn improve diagnosis and treatment options. Advances of Deep learning makes it ideal to achieve those goals, however, its application is limited by the cost of high quality labels from patients data. Unsupervised learning, in particular, deep generative models with representation learning properties provides an alternative path to further understand cancer tissue phenotypes, capturing tissue morphologies. In this paper, we develop a framework which allows Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to capture key tissue features and uses these characteristics to give structure to its latent space. To this end, we trained our model on two different datasets, an H&E colorectal cancer tissue from the National Center for Tumor diseases (NCT, Germany) and an H&E breast cancer tissue from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI, Netherlands) and Vancouver General Hospital (VGH, Canada). Composed of 86 slide images and 576 tissue micro-arrays (TMAs) respectively. We show that our model generates high quality images, with a Frechet Inception Distance (FID) of 16.65 (breast cancer) and 32.05 (colorectal cancer). We further assess the quality of the images with cancer tissue characteristics (e.g. count of cancer, lymphocytes, or stromal cells), using quantitative information to calculate the FID and showing consistent performance of 9.86. Additionally, the latent space of our model shows an interpretable structure and allows semantic vector operations that translate into tissue feature transformations. Furthermore, ratings from two expert pathologists found no significant difference between our generated tissue images from real ones. The code, generated images, and pretrained model are available at https://github.com/AdalbertoCq/Pathology-GAN"
2023,Classification of Melanoma Skin Cancer Based on Transformer Deep Learning Model,"An increasing number of genetic and metabolic anomalies have been determined to lead to cancer, which is generally fatal. Cancerous cells may spread to any body part, which can be life-threatening. Skin cancer is significant cancer, and its frequency is increasing worldwide. The main subtypes of skin cancer are squamous and basal cell carcinomas and melanoma. The deep learning methods were used to detect the two primary types of tumours, malignant and benign, by using the MELANOMA dataset. The proposed system utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN), transformer, and InceptionV3 architecture to learn and extract meaningful features from skin lesion images. The CNN model was trained on a large dataset of dermoscopic images of melanoma and benign lesions.

2022,An LDA–SVM Machine Learning Model for Breast Cancer Classification,"Breast cancer is a prevalent disease that affects mostly women, and early diagnosis will expedite the treatment of this ailment. Recently, machine learning (ML) techniques have been employed in biomedical and informatics to help fight breast cancer. Extracting information from data to support the clinical diagnosis of breast cancer is a tedious and time-consuming task. The use of machine learning and feature extraction techniques has significantly changed the whole process of a breast cancer diagnosis. This research work proposed a machine learning model for the classification of breast cancer. To achieve this, a support vector machine (SVM) was employed for the classification, and linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was employed for feature extraction. We measured our model’s feature extraction performance in principal component analysis (PCA) and random forest for classification. A comparative analysis of the proposed model was performed to show the effectiveness of the feature extraction, and we computed missing values based on the classifier’s accuracy, precision, and recall. The original Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset (WBCD) and Wisconsin Prognostic Breast Cancer dataset (WPBC) were used. We evaluated performance in two phases: In phase 1, rows containing missing values were computed using the mean, and in phase 2, rows containing missing values were computed using the median. LDA–SVM when median was used to compute missing values has better results, with accuracy of 99.2%, recall of 98.0% and precision of 98.0% on the WBCD dataset and an accuracy of 79.5%, recall of 76.0% and precision of 59.0% on the WPBC dataset. The SVM classifier had a better performance in handling classification problems when LDA was applied and the median was used as a method for computing missing values."
2022,Detection of Breast Cancer Lump and BRCA1/2 Genetic Mutation under Deep Learning,"To diagnose and cure breast cancer early, thus reducing the mortality of patients with breast cancer, a method was provided to judge threshold of image segmentation by wavelet transform (WT). It was used to obtain information about the general area of breast lumps by making a rough segmentation of the suspected area of the lump on mammogram. The boundary signal of the lump was obtained by region growth calculation or contour model of local activity. Meanwhile, multiplex polymerase chain reaction (mPCR) and mPCR-next-generation sequencing (mPCR-NGS) were used to detect BRCA1/2 genome. Sanger test was used for newly high virulent mutations to verify the correctness of mutagenic sites. The results were compared with the information marked by experts in the database. According to Daubechies wavelet coefficients, the average measurement accuracy was 92.9% and the average false positive rate of each image was 86%. According to mPCR-NGS, there was no pathogenic mutation in the 7 patients with high-risk BRCA1/2 genetic mutations. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in nonsynonymous coding region was detected, which was consistent with the Sanger test results. This method effectively isolated the lump area of human mammogram, and mPCR-NGS had high specificity and sensitivity in detecting BRCA1/2 genetic mutation sites. Compared with traditional Sanger test and target sequence capture test, it also had such advantages as easy operation, short duration, and low cost of consumables, which was worthy of further promotion and adoption."

AI/ML protocols were used to diagnose cancers of the colorectum, skin, uterine cervix, oral cavity, ovaries, prostate, lungs and brain. AI/ML protocols were found to improve human diagnosis, and had either similar or better performance than the human diagnosis, especially made by the less experienced clinician. Validation of AI/ML protocols was described by 223 studies of which only four studies were from India. Also there was a huge variation in the number of items used for validation. Interpretation & conclusions:: The findings of this review suggest that a meaningful translation from the validation of AI/ML protocols to their actual usage in cancer diagnosis is lacking. Development of regulatory framework specific for AI/ML usage in healthcare is essential."

Early identification of breast cancer improves survival. Therefore, radiologists will be able to make more accurate diagnoses if a computerized system is developed to detect breast cancer. Computer‐aided design techniques have the potential to help medical professionals to determine the specific location of breast tumors and better manage this disease more rapidly and accurately. MIAS datasets were used in this study.

2022,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Skin Cancer Classification from Dermoscopic Images,"We carry out a critical assessment of machine learning and deep learning models for the classification of skin tumors. Machine learning (ML) algorithms tested in this work include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors classifier, decision tree classifier and Gaussian naive Bayes, while deep learning (DL) models employed are either based on a custom Convolutional Neural Network model, or leverage transfer learning via the use of pre-trained models (VGG16, Xception and ResNet50). We find that DL models, with accuracies up to 0.88, all outperform ML models. ML models exhibit accuracies below 0.72, which can be increased to up to 0.75 with ensemble learning. To further assess the performance of DL models, we test them on a larger and more imbalanced dataset. Metrics, such as the F-score and accuracy, indicate that, after fine-tuning, pre-trained models perform extremely well for skin tumor classification.

2022,Predicting Breast Cancer Based on Optimized Deep Learning Approach,"Breast cancer is a dangerous disease with a high morbidity and mortality rate. One of the most important aspects in breast cancer treatment is getting an accurate diagnosis. Machine-learning (ML) and deep learning techniques can help doctors in making diagnosis decisions. This paper proposed the optimized deep recurrent neural network (RNN) model based on RNN and the Keras–Tuner optimization technique for breast cancer diagnosis. The optimized deep RNN consists of the input layer, five hidden layers, five dropout layers, and the output layer. In each hidden layer, we optimized the number of neurons and rate values of the dropout layer. Three feature-selection methods have been used to select the most important features from the database.

2017,Breast Cancer Multi-classification from Histopathological Images with Structured Deep Learning Model,"Abstract: Automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images plays a key role in computer-aided breast cancer diagnosis or prognosis. Breast cancer multi-classification is to identify subordinate classes of breast cancer (Ductal carcinoma, Fibroadenoma, Lobular carcinoma, etc.). However, breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images faces two main challenges from: (1) the great difficulties in breast cancer multi-classification methods contrasting with the classification of binary classes (benign and malignant), and (2) the subtle differences in multiple classes due to the broad variability of high-resolution image appearances, high coherency of cancerous cells, and extensive inhomogeneity of color distribution. Therefore, automated breast cancer multi-classification from histopathological images is of great clinical significance yet has never been explored. Existing works in literature only focus on the binary classification but do not support further breast cancer quantitative assessment. In this study, we propose a breast cancer multi-classification method using a newly proposed deep learning model. The structured deep learning model has achieved remarkable performance (average 93.2% accuracy) on a large-scale dataset, which demonstrates the strength of our method in providing an efficient tool for breast cancer multi-classification in clinical settings."

In this study, we propose a biophysical feature-based machine learning method for breast cancer detection to improve the performance beyond a benchmark deep learning algorithm and to furthermore provide a color overlay visual map of the probability of malignancy within a lesion. This overall framework is termed disease-specific imaging. Previously, 150 breast lesions were segmented and classified utilizing a modified fully convolutional network and a modified GoogLeNet, respectively. In this study multiparametric analysis was performed within the contoured lesions. Features were extracted from ultrasound radiofrequency, envelope, and log-compressed data based on biophysical and morphological models. The support vector machine with a Gaussian kernel constructed a nonlinear hyperplane, and we calculated the distance between the hyperplane and each feature’s data point in multiparametric space.

2022,Predicting neoadjuvant chemotherapy benefit using deep learning from stromal histology in breast cancer,"Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is a standard treatment option for locally advanced breast cancer. However, not all patients benefit from NAC; some even obtain worse outcomes after therapy. Hence, predictors of treatment benefit are crucial for guiding clinical decision-making. Here, we investigated the predictive potential of breast cancer stromal histology via a deep learning (DL)-based approach and proposed the tumor-associated stroma score (TS-score) for predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to NAC with a multicenter dataset. The TS-score was demonstrated to be an independent predictor of pCR, and it not only outperformed the baseline variables and stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) but also significantly improved the prediction performance of the baseline variable-based model. Furthermore, we discovered that unlike lymphocytes, collagen and fibroblasts in the stroma were likely associated with a poor response to NAC. The TS-score has the potential to better stratify breast cancer patients in NAC settings."
2019,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches in Breast Cancer Survival Prediction Using Clinical Data,"Breast cancer survival prediction can have an extreme effect on selection of best treatment protocols. Many approaches such as statistical or machine learning models have been employed to predict the survival prospects of patients, but newer algorithms such as deep learning can be tested with the aim of improving the models and prediction accuracy. In this study, we used machine learning and deep learning approaches to predict breast cancer survival in 4,902 patient records from the University of Malaya Medical Centre Breast Cancer Registry. The results indicated that the multilayer perceptron (MLP), random forest (RF) and decision tree (DT) classifiers could predict survivorship, respectively, with 88.2 %, 83.3 % and 82.5 % accuracy in the tested samples. Support vector machine (SVM) came out to be lower with 80.5 %. In this study, tumour size turned out to be the most important feature for breast cancer survivability prediction. Both deep learning and machine learning methods produce desirable prediction accuracy, but other factors such as parameter configurations and data transformations affect the accuracy of the predictive model."
2020,A Novel Deep Learning Method for Identification of Cancer Genes From Gene Expression Dataset,"Computational biology is the research area that contributes to the analysis of biological information. The selection of the subset of cancer-related genes is one amongst the foremost promising clinical research of gene expression data. Since a gene can take the role of various biological pathways that in turn can be active only under specific experimental conditions, the stacked denoising auto-encoder(SDAE) and the genetic algorithm were combined to perform biclustering of cancer genes from huge dimensional microarray gene expression data. The Genetic-SDAE proved superior to recently proposed biclustering methods and better to determine the maximum similarity of a set of biclusters of gene expression data with lower MSR and higher gene variance. This work also assesses the results with respect to the discovered genes and spot that the extracted set of biclusters are supported by biological evidence, such as enrichment of gene functions and biological processes."
2023,Data-Efficient Computational Pathology Platform for Faster and Cheaper Breast Cancer Subtype Identifications: Development of a Deep Learning Model,"Background: Breast cancer subtyping is a crucial step in determining therapeutic options, but the molecular examination based on immunohistochemical staining is expensive and time-consuming. Deep learning opens up the possibility to predict the subtypes based on the morphological information from hematoxylin and eosin staining, a much cheaper and faster alternative. However, training the predictive model conventionally requires a large number of histology images, which is challenging to collect by a single institute. Objective: We aimed to develop a data-efficient computational pathology platform, 3DHistoNet, which is capable of learning from z-stacked histology images to accurately predict breast cancer subtypes with a small sample size. Methods: We retrospectively examined 401 cases of patients with primary breast carcinoma diagnosed between 2018 and 2020 at the Department of Pathology, National Cancer Center, South Korea. Pathology slides of the patients with breast carcinoma were prepared according to the standard protocols. Age, gender, histologic grade, hormone receptor (estrogen receptor [ER], progesterone receptor [PR], and androgen receptor [AR]) status, erb-B2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 (HER2) status, and Ki-67 index were evaluated by reviewing medical charts and pathological records. Results: The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve were analyzed to evaluate the performance of our 3DHistoNet platform for predicting the ER, PR, AR, HER2, and Ki67 subtype biomarkers with 5-fold cross-validation. We demonstrated that 3DHistoNet can predict all clinically important biomarkers (ER, PR, AR, HER2, and Ki67) with performance exceeding the conventional multiple instance learning models by a considerable margin (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.75-0.91 vs 0.67-0.8). We further showed that our z-stack histology scanning method can make up for insufficient training data sets without any additional cost incurred. Finally, 3DHistoNet offered an additional capability to generate attention maps that reveal correlations between Ki67 and histomorphological features, which renders the hematoxylin and eosin image in higher fidelity to the pathologist. Conclusions: Our stand-alone, data-efficient pathology platform that can both generate z-stacked images and predict key biomarkers is an appealing tool for breast cancer diagnosis. Its development would encourage morphology-based diagnosis, which is faster, cheaper, and less error-prone compared to the protein quantification method based on immunohistochemical staining."
2022,Models of Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Diagnosis of Lung Cancer Pathology Based on Deep Learning Algorithms,"In this article, in order to explore the application of a diagnosis system for lung cancer, we use an auxiliary diagnostic system to predict and diagnose the good and evil attributes of chest CT pulmonary nodules. This research improves the new diagnosis method based on the convolutional neural network (CNN) and the recurrent neural network (RNN) and combines the dual effects of the two algorithms to process the classification of benign and malignant nodules. By collecting H-E-stained pathological slices of 652 patients' lung lesions from two hospitals between January 2018 and January 2019, the output results of the improved 3D U-net system and the consistent results of two-person reading were compared. This article analyzes the sensitivity, specificity, positive flammability rate, and negative flammability rate of different lung nodule detection methods. In addition, the artificial intelligence system’s and the radiologist's judgment results of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules are used to draw ROC curves for further analysis. The improved model has an accuracy rate of 92.3% for predicting malignant lung nodules and an accuracy rate of 82.8% for benign lung nodules. The new diagnostic method using the convolutional neural network and the recurrent neural network can be very effective for improving the accuracy of predicting lung cancer diagnosis. It can play a very effective role in the disease prediction of lung cancer patients, thereby improving the treatment effect."
2021,Machine Learning for Prediction of Lung Cancer,"This work is focused on lung cancer prediction using machine learning technique. Lung cancer is one of the widespread diseases due to the growth of irregular cell in both the lungs as a result of which this irregular cell starts growing into tumour, and this tumour can be cancerous as well as non-cancerous. In the traditional approach CT scan images has been used based on the report image segmentation has been done to remove the noise so that a clear picture can be generated to detect the location of tumor. Once the location is known then classification or clustering approach can be used to predict the stage of cancer. Previously supervised machine learning algorithm has been used to predict lung cancer. In this work a prediction model is proposed that is based on the median filter, watershed segmentation, and then feature extraction has done like texture and region. And on the extracted feature classification technique was applied for prediction of cancer."

2023,Noninvasive Staging of Lymph Node Status in Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning: External Validation and Further Model Development,"Background: Most patients diagnosed with breast cancer present with a node-negative disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely used for axillary staging, leaving patients with healthy axillary lymph nodes without therapeutic effects but at risk of morbidities from the intervention. Numerous studies have developed nodal status prediction models for noninvasive axillary staging using postoperative data or imaging features that are not part of the diagnostic workup. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a top-ranked predictor of nodal metastasis; however, its preoperative assessment is challenging. Objective: This paper aimed to externally validate a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for noninvasive lymph node staging (NILS) in a large population-based cohort (n=18,633) and develop a new MLP in the same cohort. Data were extracted from the Swedish National Quality Register for Breast Cancer (NKBC, 2014-2017), comprising only routinely and preoperatively available documented clinicopathological variables. A secondary aim was to develop and validate an LVI MLP for imputation of missing LVI status to increase the preoperative feasibility of the original NILS model. Methods: Three nonoverlapping cohorts were used for model development and validation. A total of 4 MLPs for nodal status and 1 LVI MLP were developed using 11 to 12 routinely available predictors. Three nodal status models were used to account for the different availabilities of LVI status in the cohorts and external validation in NKBC. The fourth nodal status model was developed for 80% (14,906/18,663) of NKBC cases and validated in the remaining 20% (3727/18,663). Three alternatives for imputation of LVI status were compared. The discriminatory capacity was evaluated using the validation area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) in 3 of the nodal status models. The clinical feasibility of the models was evaluated using calibration and decision curve analyses. Results: External validation of the original NILS model was performed in NKBC (AUC 0.699, 95% CI 0.690-0.708) with good calibration and the potential of sparing 16% of patients with node-negative disease from SLNB. The LVI model was externally validated (AUC 0.747, 95% CI 0.694-0.799) with good calibration but did not improve the discriminatory performance of the nodal status models. A new nodal status model was developed in NKBC without information on LVI (AUC 0.709, 95% CI: 0.688-0.729), with excellent calibration in the holdout internal validation cohort, resulting in the potential omission of 24% of patients from unnecessary SLNBs. Conclusions: The NILS model was externally validated in NKBC, where the imputation of LVI status did not improve the model’s discriminatory performance. A new nodal status model demonstrated the feasibility of using register data comprising only the variables available in the preoperative setting for NILS using machine learning. Future steps include ongoing preoperative validation of the NILS model and extending the model with, for example, mammography images."
2023,Classification of Breast Cancer in Mammograms Using an Optimized Hybrid Deep Learning Models and Feature Fusion Techniques,"Abstract: Breast cancer is the most common deadly disease occurred in women. The major cause of the breast cancer agent is still not known. The early detection and treatment of breast cancer prevent the spreading of cancers to other parts and increase the lifetime of patients. Micro-calcification is one of the main signs of breast cancer. Mammography is a widely used digital screening approach to detect a microcalcification cluster in images. Compared to other image modalities, mammography is inexpensive and requires a low radiation dose. Image processing techniques with the aid of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques support radiologists to diagnose breast cancers earlier. In this work, the modified hybrid models with optimized feature selection models are proposed for accurate microcalcification classifications. The hybrid models of ResNet101V2 with Long short-term memory (LSTM) layers and ResNet101V2 with Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers are proposed for feature extraction. Then, the features are combined using serial-based feature fusion techniques. The performance of classifier models and feature selection process is improved using the metaheuristic algorithm of the Cheetahs optimizer. Experimental results on the MIAS breast cancer database show the superior performance of proposed models in terms of area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, and specificity and recall rates."
2022,Hybrid Model for Breast Cancer Diagnosis on Mammograms Using Transfer Learning,"Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer among women all over the world, which leads to the death of many women every year due to misdiagnosis and late treatment. Therefore, in this research, a new deep learning model was developed based on Python and using the mini-MIAS dataset. Initially image contrast optimization operations and segmentation were performed to enhance image and extract the region of interest (breast region) in order to improve the performance of the model and increase the accuracy of diagnosis and then extract the features using the transfer learning technique and based on a set of pre-trained networks. A comparison was made between a set of pre-trained convolutional network architectures (VGG16, ResNet50, MobileNetV2, InceptionV3) where the VGG16 network gave the best performance in the phase of extracting features and then building the final hybrid model by merging the VGG16 network with the random forest classifier. Our model achieved 94.25% average accuracy and the Area under curve (AUC) is 98% for all three classes, in addition to reducing the time required to build the system."
2022,A Diagnostic Model of Breast Cancer Based on Digital Mammogram Images Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Breast cancer disease is one of the most recorded cancers that lead to morbidity and maybe death among women around the world. Recent research statistics have exposed that one from 8 females in the USA and one from 10 females in Europe are contaminated by breast cancer. The challenge with this disease is how to develop a relaxed and fast diagnosing method. One of the attractive ways of early breast cancer diagnosis is based on the mammogram images analysis of the breast using a computer-aided diagnosing (CAD) tool. This paper firstly aimed to propose an efficient method for diagnosing tumors based on mammogram images of breasts using a machine learning approach. Secondly, this paper aimed to the development of a CAD software program for breast cancer diagnosing based on the proposed method in the first step. The followed step-by-step procedure of the proposed method is performed by passing the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) through five steps of image preprocessing, image segmentation using seeded region growing (SRG) algorithm, feature extraction using different feature’s extraction classes, and important and effectiveness feature selection using the Sequential Forward Selection (SFS) technique, and finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm is used as a binary classifier in two classification levels. The first level classifier is used to categorize the given image as normal or abnormal while the second-level classifier is used for further classifying the abnormal image as either a malignant or benign cancer. The proposed method is studied and investigated in two phases: the training phase and the testing phase, with the MIAS dataset of mammogram images, using 70% and 30% ratios of dataset images for the training and testing sets, respectively. The practical implementation of the proposed method and the graphical user interface (GUI) CAD tool are carried out using MATLAB software. Experimental results of the proposed method have shown that the accuracy of the proposed method reached 100% in classifying images as normal and abnormal mammogram images while the classification accuracy for benign and malignant is equal to 87.1%."
2023,A hierarchical self‐attention‐guided deep learning framework to predict breast cancer response to chemotherapy using pre‑treatment tumor biopsies,"Background: Pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) has demonstrated a strong correlation to improved survival in breast cancer (BC) patients. However, pCR rates to NAC are less than 30%, depending on the BC subtype. Early prediction of NAC response would facilitate therapeutic modifications for individual patients, potentially improving overall treatment outcomes and patient survival. Purpose: This study, for the first time, proposes a hierarchical self‐attention‐guided deep learning framework to predict NAC response in breast cancer patients using digital histopathological images of pre‐treatment biopsy specimens. Methods: Digitized hematoxylin and eosin‐stained slides of BC core needle biopsies were obtained from 207 patients treated with NAC, followed by surgery. The response to NAC for each patient was determined using the standard clinical and pathological criteria after surgery. The digital pathology images were processed through the proposed hierarchical framework consisting of patch‐level and tumor‐level processing modules followed by a patient‐level response prediction component. A combination of convolutional layers and transformer self‐attention blocks were utilized in the patch‐level processing architecture to generate optimized feature maps. The feature maps were analyzed through two vision transformer architectures adapted for the tumor‐level processing and the patient‐level response prediction components. The feature map sequences for these transformer architectures were defined based on the patch positions within the tumor beds and the bed positions within the biopsy slide, respectively. A five‐fold cross‐validation at the patient level was applied on the training set (144 patients with 9430 annotated tumor beds and 1,559,784 patches) to train the models and optimize the hyperparameters. An unseen independent test set (63 patients with 3574 annotated tumor beds and 173,637 patches) was used to evaluate the framework. Results: The obtained results on the test set showed an AUC of 0.89 and an F1‐score of 90% for predicting pCR to NAC a priori by the proposed hierarchical framework. Similar frameworks with the patch‐level, patch‐level + tumor‐level, and patch‐level + patient‐level processing components resulted in AUCs of 0.79, 0.81, and 0.84 and F1‐scores of 86%, 87%, and 89%, respectively. Conclusions: The results demonstrate a high potential of the proposed hierarchical deep‐learning methodology for analyzing digital pathology images of pre‐treatment tumor biopsies to predict the pathological response of breast cancer to NAC."
2023,Explainable Artificial Intelligence based Ensemble Machine Learning for Ovarian Cancer Stratification using Electronic Health Records,"The purpose of this study is to show how ensemble learning-driven machine learning algorithms outperform individual machine learning algorithms at predicting ovarian cancer on a biomarker dataset. Additionally, this study provides model explanations using explainable Artificial Intelligence methods, The method involved gathering and combining 49 risk factors from 349 patients. We hypothesize that ensemble machine learning systems are superior to individual Machine Learning systems in predicting ovarian cancer. The Machine Learning system consists of five individual Machine Learning and five ensemble Machine Learning systems were trained using K-10 cross validation protocols. These training models were then used to predict the development of benign ovarian tumors and ovarian cancer tumors patients. The AUC and Accuracy metrics for ensemble machine learning increased by 19% and 16%. The MCC and Kappa scores for ensemble Machine Learning also increased over individual machine learning by 29% and 33%, respectively. As a result, we draw the conclusion that ensembled-based algorithms outperform individual machine learning in terms of ovarian carcinoma prediction."
2022,Pilot study of an artificial intelligence-based deep learning algorithm to predict time to castration-resistant prostate cancer for metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer,"Abstract: The object in this study is to develop an artificial intelligence-based deep learning algorithm for prediction of time to castration-resistant prostate cancer by combined androgen blockade therapy in metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer. We included 180 metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer patients who initially received combined androgen blockade. We first evaluated whether time to castration-resistant prostate cancer was a significant prognostic factor. Then, using the patients’ needle-biopsy specimen images, we developed and validated our deep learning algorithm. The results are shown below. First, we confirmed that time to castration-resistant prostate cancer correlated with overall survival (P &lt; 0.001). Next, we selected two groups by time to castration-resistant prostate cancer of &gt;24 months (n = 18) and &lt;6 months (n = 6) and developed a deep learning algorithm by artificial intelligence-based machine deep learning. In 16 other metastatic hormone-naïve prostate cancer patients used as an external validation set, we confirmed the prediction accuracy remained significant (P &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, our obtained deep learning algorithm has high predictive ability for the effectiveness of combined androgen blockade."
2022,A deep learning model for breast ductal carcinoma in situ classification in whole slide images,"Abstract: The pathological differential diagnosis between breast ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is of pivotal importance for determining optimum cancer treatment(s) and clinical outcomes. Since conventional diagnosis by pathologists using micro-scopes is limited in terms of human resources, it is necessary to develop new techniques that can rapidly and accurately diagnose large numbers of histopathological specimens. Computational pathology tools which can assist pathologists in detecting and classifying DCIS and IDC from whole slide images (WSIs) would be of great benefit for routine pathological diagnosis. In this paper, we trained deep learning models capable of classifying biopsy and surgical histopathological WSIs into DCIS, IDC, and benign. We evaluated the models on two independent test sets (n=1,382, n=548), achieving ROC areas under the curves (AUCs) up to 0.960 and 0.977 for DCIS and IDC, respectively."
2023,An Ensemble Classification Method Based on Deep Neural Networks for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"Advances in technology have led to advances in breast cancer screening by detecting symptoms that doctors have overlooked. In this paper, an automatic detection system for breast cancer cases based on Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed. First, using IoT technology, direct medical images are sent to the data repository after the suspicious person's visit through medical equipment equipped with IoT. Then, in order to help radiologists, interpret medical images as best as possible, we use four pre-trained convolutional neural network models including InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, VGG19 and ResNet152. These models are combined by an ensemble classifier. Also, these models are used to accurately predict cases with breast cancer, healthy people, and cases with pneumonia by using two datasets of X-RAY and CT-scan in a three-class classification. Finally, the best result obtained for CT-scan images belongs to InceptionResNetV2 architecture with 99.36% accuracy and for X-RAY images belongs to InceptionV3 architecture with 96.94% accuracy. The results show that this method leads to a reduction in daily visits to medical centers and thus reduces the pressure on the medical care system. It also helps radiologists and medical staff to detect breast cancer in its early stages."

2023,An Integrated Framework with Deep Learning for Segmentation and Classification of Cancer Disease,"This paper addresses radiologists’ specific diagnosis of cancer disease effectively using integrated framework of deep learning model. Although several existing diagnosis systems have been adopted by a physician, in few cases, it is not so practical to see the infected area from images in the normal eye. Thus, a fully integrated diagnosis framework for disease detection is proposed to find out the infected area from image using deep learning approaches in this paper. In this proposed framework, various components are designed through deep learning approaches such as detection, segmentation, classification etc. based on mass region. The classification technique is used to classify the disease as either benign or malignant. The vital part of this framework is developed by using a full resolution convolutional network (FrCN) that supports different stages of image processing, especially breast cancer disease. Different experimental evaluation is taken to perform on the accuracy, cross-validation tests, and the comparative testing. Since we have taken 4-fold evaluation, the FrCN performs with an average 98.7% Dice index, 97.8% TS/CSI coefficient, 99.1% overall accuracy, and 98.15% MCC. Our experiments demonstrated that the proposed diagnosis system performs on the deep learning approaches at each segmentation stage and classification with good results."
2022,Detection of Breast Cancer Images Based on Transfer and Deep Learning Models,"Abstract: Using a technology known as deep learning, which involves classifying photos based on the data they contain, it is possible to detect images, such as tumors and other signs. Because of the scarcity of pathologists and the growing number of patients with breast cancer, the manual numeration of biopsy echantillons must be mechanized (CS). To rectify the histopathological images of malignant tissue, preliminary study is required, which can be done utilizing BreaKHis' free database of data. An approach based on isolated image fragments is proposed, with the final categorization determined by an interconnected network of neurons (CNN) and a final combination of these pieces. Because of its unique architecture, capacity to recognize speech, identify objects, and analyze signals, as well as the popularity of neural language processing, the CNN is attracting increasing interest from industry and researchers. The employment of transfer learning methods is a problem with tiny collections of medical data. To improve the classification of defamatory and obscene photos, this article recommends integrating the impacts of many resolutions. In order to better depict the entering image's texture, many essential phases in CNN development are also used. Maintain a safe distance from the model's customization. Traditional CNN development may become more complex and expensive as a result. The simulation results achieved by running CNN in MATLAB outperform other artificial intelligence (AI) models recently published that used hand-crafted texture descriptors. With this in mind, we looked at all of CNN's possible combinations and discovered a technique to boost the execution rate by a little amount."
2021,Deep Multi-View Breast Cancer Detection: A Multi-View Concatenated Infrared Thermal Images Based Breast Cancer Detection System Using Deep Transfer Learning,"This paper simply presents a fully automated breast cancer detection system as “Deep Multi-view Breast cancer Detection” based on deep transfer learning. The deep transfer learning model i.e., Visual Geometry Group 16 (VGG 16) is used in this approach for the correct classification of Breast thermal images into either normal or abnormal. This VGG 16 model is trained with the help of Static as well as Dynamic breast thermal images dataset consisting of multi-view, single view breast thermal images. These Multi-view breast thermal images are generated in this approach by concatenating the conventional left, frontal and right view breast thermal images taken from the Database for Mastology Research with Infrared image for the first time in order to generate a more informative and complete thermal temperature map of breast for enhancing the accuracy of the overall system. For the sake of genuine comparison, three other popular deep transfer learning models like Residual Network 50 (ResNet50V2), InceptionV3 network and Visual Geometry Group 19 (VGG 19) are also trained with the same augmented dataset consisting of multi-view as well as single view breast thermal images. The VGG 16 based Deep Multi-view Breast cancer Detect system delivers the best training, validation as well as testing accuracies as compared to their other deep transfer learning models. The VGG 16 achieves an encouraging testing accuracy of 99% on the Dynamic breast thermal images testing dataset utilizing the multi-view breast thermal images as input. Whereas the testing accuracies of 95%, 94% and 89% are achieved by the VGG 19, ResNet50V2, InceptionV3 models respectively over the Dynamic breast thermal images testing dataset utilizing the same multi-view breast thermal images as input."
2022,Endocrine Therapy Recommendation for Estrogen Receptor Positive (ER + ) Metastases Advanced Breast Cancer using Machine Learning Algorithms,"Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has shown tremendous contribution in various applications like Speech Recognition, Expert Systems, Computer Vision, Robotics, Gaming etc. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) algorithms under AI address problems such as prediction, classification and regression. AI has touched many domains like Finance, Healthcare, Retail, Travel, Media etc. The results or the predictions generated by these algorithms are not easily accepted by the user with the apprehension as what AI promises, how can they guarantee it? Especially the Healthcare domain is facing a great challenge in accepting the results or the predictions with the concern, are AI results reliable, correct and ethical? Doctors or medical practitioners aren’t ready to treat patients on the basis of results or suggestions generated by AI algorithms. Hence, a technology which can explain how the results returned by AI algorithms are trustworthy, transparent and interpretable was strongly needed.

2023,Optimization of Breast Cancer Prediction using Optimaze Parameter on Machine Learning,"At present, a very common cancer disease in women is breast cancer. This cancer develops in the female breast tissue and is the cancer with the highest mortality rate. This needs great attention. Forecasting breast cancer has been studied by a number of researchers and is considered a serious threat to women. Clinical difficulties in creating treatment approaches that will help patients live longer, due to the lack of solid predictive models that can predict outcomes at an early stage by analyzing patient history data. Because it can affect women all over the world. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial in determining the path of action. Cancer types can be distinguished into two types: benign and malignant. this research aims to provide information and science to medical professionals and also cancer patients to know the classification of the two types of cancer. The research project aims to also leverage data mining techniques using several algorithms on Machine Learning (ML) such as Decision Tree(DT), Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Tress (XGBoost). The results of this algorithm will determine the prediction of the most common types of cancer. The study used 683 samples of breast cancer patients, including 10 characteristics. This test is measured through mammography and biopsy tests. Using K-Fold Validation operators, then the sresults of the study showed that the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm produced the highest accuracy of 96.87% compared to the other five algorithms. Then, as a comparison again, the researchers also optimized the accuracy value using the parameter optimize operator. Where the number produced becomes more overwhelming. The highest accuracy result after calculated with the parameter optimize is the Random Forest (RF) algorithm. Where the result is 100% accurate compared to other ML algorithms. "
2019,Deep Learning Approach to Identifying Breast Cancer Subtypes Using High-Dimensional Genomic Data,"Motivation: Cancer subtype classification has the potential to significantly improve disease prognosis and develop individualized patient management. Existing methods are limited by their ability to handle extremely high-dimensional data and by the influence of misleading, irrelevant factors, resulting in ambiguous and overlapping subtypes. Results: To address the above issues, we proposed a novel approach to disentangling and eliminating irrelevant factors by leveraging the power of deep learning. Specifically, we designed a deep learning framework, referred to as DeepType, that performs joint supervised classification, unsupervised clustering and dimensionality reduction to learn cancer-relevant data representation with cluster structure. We applied DeepType to the METABRIC breast cancer dataset and compared its performance to state-of-the-art methods. DeepType significantly outperformed the existing methods, identifying more robust subtypes while using fewer genes. The new approach provides a framework for the derivation of more accurate and robust molecular cancer subtypes by using increasingly complex, multi-source data. Availability and implementation: An open-source software package for the proposed method is freely available at"
2019,Machine Learning Algorithms: Diagnosing Breast Cancer,"Breast Cancer has become one of the common diseases not only in women but also in few men. According to research, the demise rate of females has increased mainly because of Breast Cancer tumor. One out of every eight women and one out of every thousand men are diagnosed with breast cancer. Breast cancer tumors are mainly classified into two types: Benign tumor which is a non-cancerous tumor and other one is malignant tumor which is a cancerous tumor. In order to know which type of tumor a patient has; the accurate and early diagnosis is a very crucial step. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms have been used to develop and train the model for classification of the type of tumor. For accurate and better classification several classification algorithms in ML have been trained and tested on the dataset that was collected. Already algorithms like Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor and SVM showed better accuracy for classification of tumor. When we implemented Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm it gave us the best accuracy levels among all both during training as well as testing .i.e. 97%. So, the exact classification using this model will help the doctors to diagnose the type of tumor in patients quickly and accurately"
2021,Evaluation of deep learning‐based artificial intelligence techniques for breast cancer detection on mammograms: Results from a retrospective study using a BreastScreen Victoria dataset,"Introduction: This study aims to evaluate deep learning (DL)‐based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for detecting the presence of breast cancer on a digital mammogram image. Methods: We evaluated several DL‐based AI techniques that employ different approaches and backbone DL models and tested the effect on performance of using different data‐processing strategies on a set of digital mammographic images with annotations of pathologically proven breast cancer. Results: Our evaluation uses the area under curve (AUC) and accuracy (ACC) for performance measurement. The best evaluation result, based on 349 test cases (930 test images), was an AUC of 0.8979 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.873, 0.923] and ACC of 0.8178 [95% CI 0.785, 0.850]. This was achieved by an AI technique that utilises a certain family of DL models, namely ResNet, as its backbone, combines the global features extracted from the whole mammogram and the local features extracted from the automatically detected cancer and non‐cancer local regions in the whole image, and leverages background cropping and text removal, contrast adjustment and more training data. Conclusion: DL‐based AI techniques have shown promising results in retrospective studies for many medical image analysis applications. Our study demonstrates a significant opportunity to boost the performance of such techniques applied to breast cancer detection by exploring different types of approaches, backbone DL models and data‐processing strategies. The promising results we have obtained suggest further development of AI reading services could transform breast cancer screening in the future."
2023,Artificial intelligence for triaging of breast cancer screening mammograms and workload reduction: A meta-analysis of a deep learning software,"Objective: Deep learning (DL) has shown promising results for improving mammographic breast cancer diagnosis. However, the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the breast cancer screening process has not yet been fully elucidated in terms of potential workload reduction. We aim to assess if AI-based triaging of breast cancer screening mammograms could reduce the radiologist's workload with non-inferior sensitivity. Methods: PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched for studies that evaluated AI algorithms on computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms. We extracted data from homogenous studies and performed a proportion meta-analysis with a random-effects model to examine the radiologist's workload reduction (proportion of low-risk mammograms that could be theoretically ruled out from human's assessment) and the software's sensitivity to breast cancer detection. Results: Thirteen studies were selected for full review, and three studies that used the same commercially available DL algorithm were included in the meta-analysis. In the 156,852 examinations included, the threshold of 7 was identified as optimal. With these parameters, radiologist workload decreased by 68.3% (95%CI 0.655–0.711, I² = 98.76%, p < 0.001), while achieving a sensitivity of 93.1% (95%CI 0.882–0.979, I² = 83.86%, p = 0.002) and a specificity of 68.7% (95% CI 0.684–0.723, I² = 97.5%, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The deployment of DL computer-aided triage of breast cancer screening mammograms reduces the radiology workload while maintaining high sensitivity. Although the implementation of AI remains complex and heterogeneous, it is a promising tool to optimize healthcare resources."
2021,Deep learning for breast cancer classification: Enhanced tangent function,"Abstract: Recently, deep learning using convolutional neural network (CNN) has been used successfully to classify the images of breast cells accurately. However, the accuracy of manual classification of those histopathological images is comparatively low. This research aims to increase the accuracy of the classification of breast cancer images by utilizing a patch‐based classifier (PBC) along with deep learning architecture. The proposed system consists of a deep convolutional neural network that helps in enhancing and increasing the accuracy of the classification process. This is done by the use of the PBC. CNN has completely different layers where images are first fed through convolutional layers using hyperbolic tangent function together with the max‐pooling layer, drop out layers, and SoftMax function for classification. Further, the output obtained is fed to a PBC that consists of patch‐wise classification output followed by majority voting. The results are obtained throughout the classification stage for breast cancer images that are collected from breast‐histology datasets. The proposed solution improves the accuracy of classification whether or not the images had normal, benign, in‐situ, or invasive carcinoma from 87% to 94% with a decrease in processing time from 0.45 to 0.2 s on average. The proposed solution focused on increasing the accuracy of classifying cancer in the breast by enhancing the image contrast and reducing the vanishing gradient. Finally, this solution for the implementation of the contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization technique and modified tangent function helps in increasing the accuracy."
2022,A Spatial Attention Guided Deep Learning System for Prediction of Pathological Complete Response Using Breast Cancer Histopathology Images,"Predicting pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients accurately is direly needed for clinical decision making. pCR is also regarded as a strong predictor of overall survival. In this work, we propose a deep learning system to predict pCR to NAC based on serial pathology images stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and two immunohistochemical biomarkers (Ki67 and PHH3). To support human prior domain knowledge based guidance and enhance interpretability of the deep learning system, we introduce a human knowledge derived spatial attention mechanism to inform deep learning models of informative tissue areas of interest. For each patient, three serial breast tumor tissue sections from biopsy blocks were sectioned, stained in three different stains, and integrated. The resulting comprehensive attention information from the image triplets is used to guide our prediction system for prognostic tissue regions. The experimental dataset consists of 26,419 pathology image patches of 1,000 × 1,000 pixels from 73 TNBC patients treated with NAC. Image patches from randomly selected 43 patients are used as a training dataset and images patches from the rest 30 are used as a testing dataset. By the maximum voting from patch-level results, our proposed model achieves a 93% patient-level accuracy, outperforming baselines and other state-of-the-art systems, suggesting its high potential for clinical decision making. The codes, the documentation, and example data are available on an open source at:"
2022,A Novel Machine Learning Systematic Framework and Web Tool for Breast Cancer Survival Rate Assessment,"Abstract: Cancer research, including that of breast cancer, has increasingly relied on molecular profiling based on advances in genomic technology. Although these techniques have permitted scientists to unravel the process by which cancer develops, scientists still struggle to effectively translate the vast amounts of patient data into clinically meaningful results. As a result, tasks such as predicting the human response to differing treatments remains a major challenge in cancer treatment."
2021,Cancer Grade Model: a multi-gene machine learning-based risk classification for improving prognosis in breast cancer,"Background: Prognostic stratification of breast cancers remains a challenge to improve clinical decision making. We employ machine learning on breast cancer transcriptomics from multiple studies to link the expression of specific genes to histological grade and classify tumours into a more or less aggressive prognostic type. Materials and methods: Microarray data of 5031 untreated breast tumours spanning 33 published datasets and corresponding clinical data were integrated. A machine learning model based on gradient boosted trees was trained on histological grade-1 and grade-3 samples. The resulting predictive model (Cancer Grade Model, CGM) was applied on samples of grade-2 and unknown-grade (3029) for prognostic risk classification. Results: A 70-gene signature for assessing clinical risk was identified and was shown to be 90% accurate when tested on known histological-grade samples. The predictive framework was validated through survival analysis and showed robust prognostic performance. CGM was cross-referenced with existing genomic tests and demonstrated the competitive predictive power of tumour risk. Conclusions: CGM is able to classify tumours into better-defined prognostic categories without employing information on tumour size, stage, or subgroups. The model offers means to improve prognosis and support the clinical decision and precision treatments, thereby potentially contributing to preventing underdiagnosis of high-risk tumours and minimising over-treatment of low-risk disease."
2022,Machine Learning Methods for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,"As many modern diseases begin to surface especially as of late, such as the Ebola and COVID-19 epidemics, scientists have begun developing new and innovative tactics to combat them. While new medicine and vaccines may be developed, one area that needs special attention is the diagnosis of diseases – this is because without a proper and speedy diagnosis, scientists wouldn’t be able to detect diseases, rendering treatment ineffective. Scientists have begun using machine learning algorithms to help ensure an accurate and speedy diagnosis. One specific disease that has seen frequent testing around machine learning diagnosis is breast cancer. Breast cancer is one of the deadliest and common cancers around the world for women, and due to its effects, the doctrine of speed in diagnosis is essential. This study will attempt to find out, out of three machine learning algorithms (neural networks, logistic regression and K-nearest neighbours), which one is the most effective at diagnosing breast cancer using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Results suggest that neural networks perform the best in diagnosing breast cancer, however only by a small margin compared to other results."
2023,Multimodal deep learning for liver cancer applications: a scoping review,"Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the liver and a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. The multimodal data combines several modalities, such as medical images, clinical parameters, and electronic health record (EHR) reports, from diverse sources to accomplish the diagnosis of liver cancer. The introduction of deep learning models with multimodal data can enhance the diagnosis and improve physicians' decision-making for cancer patients. Objective: This scoping review explores the use of multimodal deep learning techniques (i.e., combining medical images and EHR data) in diagnosing and prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Methodology: A comprehensive literature search was conducted in six databases along with forward and backward references list checking of the included studies. PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) extension for scoping review guidelines were followed for the study selection process. The data was extracted and synthesized from the included studies through thematic analysis. Results: Ten studies were included in this review. These studies utilized multimodal deep learning to predict and diagnose hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), but no studies examined cholangiocarcinoma (CCA). Four imaging modalities (CT, MRI, WSI, and DSA) and 51 unique EHR records (clinical parameters and biomarkers) were used in these studies. The most frequently used medical imaging modalities were CT scans followed by MRI, whereas the most common EHR parameters used were age, gender, alpha-fetoprotein AFP, albumin, coagulation factors, and bilirubin. Ten unique deep-learning techniques were applied to both EHR modalities and imaging modalities for two main purposes, prediction and diagnosis. Conclusion: The use of multimodal data and deep learning techniques can help in the diagnosis and prediction of HCC. However, there is a limited number of works and available datasets for liver cancer, thus limiting the overall advancements of AI for liver cancer applications. Hence, more research should be undertaken to explore further the potential of multimodal deep learning in liver cancer applications."
2023,Develop and validate a radiomics space-time model to predict the pathological complete response in patients undergoing neoadjuvant treatment of rectal cancer: an artificial intelligence model study based on machine learning,"Objective: In this study, we aimed to investigate the predictive efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomics features at different time points of neoadjuvant therapy for rectal cancer in patients with pathological complete response (pCR). Furthermore, we aimed to develop and validate a radiomics space–time model (RSTM) using machine learning for artificial intelligence interventions in predicting pCR in patients. Methods: Clinical and imaging data of 83 rectal cancer patients were retrospectively analyzed, and the patients were classified as pCR and non-pCR patients according to their postoperative pathological results. All patients received one MRI examination before and after neoadjuvant therapy to extract radiomics features, including pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features. Delta features were defined by the ratio of the difference between the pre- and the post-treatment features to the pre-treatment feature. After feature dimensionality reduction based on the above three feature types, the RSTM was constructed using machine learning methods, and its performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). Results: The AUC values of the individual basic models constructed by pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features were 0.771, 0.681, and 0.871, respectively. Their sensitivity values were 0.727, 0.864, and 0.909, respectively, and their specificity values were 0.803, 0.492, and 0.656, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values of the combined basic model constructed by combining pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta features were 0.901, 0.909, and 0.803, respectively. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity values of the RSTM constructed using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classifier on the basis of the combined basic model were 0.944, 0.871, and 0.983, respectively. The Delong test showed that the performance of RSTM was significantly different from that of pre-treatment, post-treatment, and delta models ( Conclusions: The RSTM constructed using the KNN classifier based on the combined features of before and after neoadjuvant therapy and delta features had the best predictive efficacy for pCR of neoadjuvant therapy. It may emerge as a new clinical tool to assist with individualized management of rectal cancer patients."
2023,Ridge regression baseline model outperforms deep learning method for cancer genetic dependency prediction,"Abstract: Accurately predicting genetic or other cellular vulnerabilities of unscreened, or difficult to screen, cancer samples will allow vast advancements in precision oncology. We re-analyzed a recently published deep learning method for predicting cancer genetic dependencies from their omics profiles. After implementing a ridge regression baseline model with an alternative, simplified problem setup, we achieved a model that outperforms the original deep learning method. Our study demonstrates the importance of problem formulation in machine learning applications and underscores the need for rigorous comparisons with baseline approaches."
2023,Identification of Breast Cancer Metastasis Markers Using Machine Learning Approaches with Gene Expression Profiles,"Cancer metastasis accounts for approximately 90% of cancer deaths, and elucidating markers in metastasis is the first step in its prevention. To characterize metastasis marker genes of breast cancer (MGs), XGBoost models that classify metastasis status were trained with gene expression profiles from TCGA. Then, a metastasis score (MS) was assigned to each gene by calculating the inner product between the feature importance and AUC performance of the models. As a result, the 54, 202, and 357 genes with the highest MS were characterized as MGs by empirical P-value cutoffs of 0.001, 0.005, and 0.01, respectively. The three sets of MGs were compared with those from existing metastasis marker databases, which provided significant results in most comparisons. We noticed that the set of MGs with the median EP cutoff showed better performance than the other two sets, suggesting the importance of the cutoff used in determining MGs. They were also significantly enriched in biological processes associated to breast cancer metastasis. The MGs that could not be identified by statistical analysis (e.g., GOLM1, ELAVL1, UBP1, and AZGP1) as well as the MGs with the highest MS (e.g., ZNF676, FAM163B, LDOC2, IRF1, and STK40) were verified via the literature. Additionally, we checked how close the MGs are located to each other in the protein–protein interaction networks. We expect that the characterized markers will help understand and prevent breast cancer metastasis."
2023,A Comparative Analysis of Data for the Classification of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning,"<title>Abstract</title> <p>One of the biggest issues facing humanity in developing countries is cancer-related mortality. Certain cancer kinds still lack a cure, even though there are many strategies to stop them from occurring in the first place. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers, and early detection is crucial to its treatment. One of the most crucial steps in the treatment of breast cancer is an accurate diagnosis. There is numerous research about predicting the type of breast cancer in the literature. In this study, predictions on the types of breast cancers were made using the information on breast cancer tumors from Dr. William H. Walberg of the University of Wisconsin Hospital. This dataset was subjected to data visualization and machine learning methods such as logistic regression and support vector machines. These machine learning methods and visualization were implemented using Python. To detect breast cancer diagnosis, analysis of data using machine learning techniques is performed. The decision-making process for cancer diagnosis can be significantly impacted by data visualisation and machine learning techniques. Several machine learning and data mining strategies for the early identification of breast cancer were suggested in this research. The maximum level of performance was attained using the logistic regression model with all characteristics included. The suggested method demonstrated improved accuracy performances. These results indicated the potential to open new opportunities in the detection of breast cancer.</p>"
2021,Breast Cancer Detection Using Random Forest Classifier,"Breast cancer is the second most prevalent type of cancer among women. Breast ultrasound (BUS) imaging is one of the most frequently used diagnostic tools to detect and classify abnormalities in the breast. To improve the diagnostic accuracy, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system is helpful for breast cancer detection and classification. Normally, a CAD system consists of four stages: pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification. In this chapter, the pre-processing step includes speckle noise removal using speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD) filter. The goal of segmentation is to locate the region of interest (ROI) and active contour-based segmentation and fuzzy C means segmentation (FCM) are used in this work. The texture features are extracted and fed to a classifier to categorize the images as normal, benign, and malignant. In this work, three classifiers, namely k-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm, decision tree algorithm, and random forest classifier, are used and the performance is compared based on the accuracy of classification."
2023,Data-centric artificial intelligence in oncology: a systematic review assessing data quality in machine learning models for head and neck cancer,"Abstract: Machine learning models have been increasingly considered to model head and neck cancer outcomes for improved screening, diagnosis, treatment, and prognostication of the disease. As the concept of data-centric artificial intelligence is still incipient in healthcare systems, little is known about the data quality of the models proposed for clinical utility. This is important as it supports the generalizability of the models and data standardization. Therefore, this study overviews the quality of structured and unstructured data used for machine learning model construction in head and neck cancer. Relevant studies reporting on the use of machine learning models based on structured and unstructured custom datasets between January 2016 and June 2022 were sourced from PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and Web of Science electronic databases. Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment (PROBAST) tool was used to assess the quality of individual studies before comprehensive data quality parameters were assessed according to the type of dataset used for model construction. A total of 159 studies were included in the review; 106 utilized structured datasets while 53 utilized unstructured datasets. Data quality assessments were deliberately performed for 14.2% of structured datasets and 11.3% of unstructured datasets before model construction. Class imbalance and data fairness were the most common limitations in data quality for both types of datasets while outlier detection and lack of representative outcome classes were common in structured and unstructured datasets respectively. Furthermore, this review found that class imbalance reduced the discriminatory performance for models based on structured datasets while higher image resolution and good class overlap resulted in better model performance using unstructured datasets during internal validation. Overall, data quality was infrequently assessed before the construction of ML models in head and neck cancer irrespective of the use of structured or unstructured datasets. To improve model generalizability, the assessments discussed in this study should be introduced during model construction to achieve data-centric intelligent systems for head and neck cancer management."
2023,A Predictive Model for Distant Metastasis in Patients With Breast Cancer Based on Machine Learning,"Purpose: Breast cancer starts as a local disease, but can metastasize to distant organs. In this study, we described an easy-to-use tool for predicting distant metastases based on clinical characteristics and gene expression profiles. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review of 326 patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery and CancerSCAN<sup>TM</sup> between January 2001 and December 2014 at the Samsung Medical Center. Additional retrospective data for 83 patients during 2015 were used for internal validation. CancerSCAN<sup>TM</sup>, a next-generation sequencing-based targeted deep sequencing analysis, was used for gene analysis, and Azure Machine Learning (ML) was used for the ML processes. Results: The no-distant metastasis group comprised 267 patients, while the distant metastasis group comprised 59. Using the Azure ML platform, a predictive model was developed with 326 cases. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve for predictive value was 0.917. Based on the internal validation performed using 83 patients, the true-negative was 81 and the true-positive was two when a threshold value of 0.5 was applied. Conclusion: Patients with breast cancer are at risk of metastasis and experience fear throughout their lives. Our predictive model is a valuable and easy-to-access tool for identifying patients with distant metastasis and it presents a way for each institution to achieve optimal results using its variables. Further evaluation with a larger patient population will improve the reliability of this model."
2023,Breast Cancer Histopathological Images Segmentation Using Deep Learning,"Hospitals generate a significant amount of medical data every day, which constitute a very rich database for research. Today, this database is still not exploitable because to make its valorization possible, the images require an annotation which remains a costly and difficult task. Thus, the use of an unsupervised segmentation method could facilitate the process. In this article, we propose two approaches for the semantic segmentation of breast cancer histopathology images. On the one hand, an autoencoder architecture for unsupervised segmentation is proposed, and on the other hand, an improvement U-Net architecture for supervised segmentation is proposed. We evaluate these models on a public dataset of histological images of breast cancer. In addition, the performance of our segmentation methods is measured using several evaluation metrics such as accuracy, recall, precision and F1 score. The results are competitive with those of other modern methods."
2022,Prediction for Distant Metastasis of Breast Cancer Using Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Images under Deep Learning,"This research aimed to explore the effect of using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) radiomic features to establish a model for predicting distant metastasis under dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI imaging with deep learning algorithms. The deep learning algorithm was used to segment the images. A total of 96 cases with 100 lesions were included in the metastatic group, including 2 cases of bifocal breast cancer and 2 cases of multifocal breast cancer. There were 192 cases in the nonmetastatic group, with 197 lesions, including 5 cases of multifocal breast cancer. After dynamic contrast-enhancement, the morphological features and grayscale statistical features were extracted from the lesions to establish a prediction model through sum-sum check and feature dimension reduction. The accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of prediction models based only on imaging features were compared with those created by combining radiomic features with clinical and pathological features. The created predictive model based on radiomic features for distant metastases in breast cancer showed a sensitivity of 66.7%, a specificity of 84.2%, an accuracy of 78.3%, and an AUC of 0.744. The sensitivity of the prediction model for distant metastasis of breast cancer was 67.7%, the specificity was 86.8%, the accuracy was 80.5%, and the AUC was 0.763. Bone, lung, and liver were the most common distant metastatic sites of breast cancer. Under the dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI of deep learning, the prediction model combining radiomic features with clinical and pathological features showed better predictive performance."
2022,Deep Learning-based and Machine Learning-based Application in Skin Cancer Image Classification,"Abstract: Skin cancer arises from the skin and is capable of invading other parts of the body. The earlier detection of malignant skin lesions effectively helps cure skin disease and prevents fatal skin cancer. As part of AI, machine learning and deep learning can learn the characteristics of input datasets and perform classifications with high accuracy. In this paper, the CNN, KNN, and SVM models are implemented and tested based on the datasets collected from ISIC. The idea of the implementation is to classify the images of skin lesions into benign and malignant. The information of GANs based model is gathered. The results display the accuracy of using these models to classify different types of lesions. And the discussion of the results focuses on the efficiency to implement the machine learning and deep learning models and the accuracy of using them. The goal of the study is to figure out which method is more useful in skin cancer identification. And some of the possible practices are also discussed as future expectations."
2021,Abstract PO-090: Application of deep learning methods in predicting survival and identifying high-risk populations from large optum real world breast cancer data,"Abstract: Real-World Evidence (RWE) contains abundant observational data collected during routine clinical practice. With such large-scale and high-dimensional data, we can leverage the power of neural networks to increase the capacity of classical survival models in predicting the risk of breast cancer patients, and identifying potential prognosis-associated factors retrospectively. The target cohorts were extracted based on diagnosis code, biomarker, and mastectomy procedure code, we further identified metastatic breast cancer cases according to secondary diagnosis code and physician notes. Our features consist of demographic and vital data, cancer-related measurement, and medication history, which was divided into several lines of therapy. Considering the dynamic nature of cancer therapy, time-dependent survival models are more suitable to model the hazard given the current features. Therefore, we extended the proportional-hazard-based DeepSurv and logistic-hazard-based Nnet-survival to accommodate time-dependent features, and further incorporated recurrent neural networks to make better use of sequential medication information. We trained the model on the training set (70%), tuned the hyperparameters via Bayesian Optimization on the validation set (10%), and evaluated the model with c-index and integrated brier score on the test set (20%). Compared with the classical linear cox model and pooled logistic regression, the proposed model outperformed these baselines by a significant margin, indicating the promise of using deep learning and the time-dependent prognosis model for survival prediction and risk stratification in cancer patients. In addition, the output from the neural network was interpreted with SHAP values and Integrated Gradient (IG), which shed some light on the effect of adjuvant hormone therapy, especially AI and SERM, on recurrence and overall survival. Further, our model can be improved with more collected data and a better approach to handling error and missingness in the data."
2020,Machine learning based predictive model of early mortality in stage III and IV prostate cancer,"Abstract: Prostate cancer remains the third highest cause of cancer-related deaths. Metastatic prostate cancer could yield poor prognosis, however there is limited work on predictive models for clinical decision support in stage III and IV prostate cancer."
2022,Optimal Histopathological Magnification Factors for Deep Learning-Based Breast Cancer Prediction,"Pathologists use histopathology to examine tissues or cells under a microscope to compare healthy and abnormal tissue structures. Differentiating benign from malignant tumors is the most critical aspect of cancer histopathology. Pathologists use a range of magnification factors, including 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x, to identify abnormal tissue structures. It is a painful process because specialists must spend much time sitting and gazing into the microscope lenses. Hence, pathologists are more likely to make errors due to being overworked or fatigued. Automating cancer detection in histopathology is the best way to mitigate humans’ erroneous diagnostics. Multiple approaches in the literature suggest methods to automate the detection of breast cancer based on the use of histopathological images. This work performs a comprehensive analysis to identify which magnification factors, 40x, 100x, 200x, and 400x, induce higher prediction accuracy. This study found that training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on 200x and 400x magnification factors increased the prediction accuracy compared to training on 40x and 100x. More specifically, this study finds that the CNN model performs better when trained on 200x than on 400x."
2023,Machine-learning and mechanistic modeling of primary and metastatic breast cancer growth after neoadjuvant targeted therapy,"Major findings: Using simulations from a mechanistic mathematical model compared with preclinical data from surgical metastasis models, we found anti-tumor effects of neoadjuvant RTKI treatment can differ between the primary tumor and metastases in the perioperative setting. Model simulations with variable drug doses and scheduling of neoadjuvant treatment revealed a contrasting impact on initial primary tumor debulking and metastatic outcomes long after treatment has stopped and tumor surgically removed. Using machine-learning algorithms, we identified the limited power of several circulating cellular and molecular biomarkers in predicting metastatic outcome, uncovering a potential fast-track strategy for assessing future clinical biomarkers by paring patient studies with identical studies in mice."
2020,Abstract P5-02-06: Improved histologic grading of breast cancer by a novel deep learning-based model,"Abstract: Breast cancer histologic grade is a well-established prognostic factor utilized in clinical decision making. In current clinical practice grading is conducted manually by pathologists and this procedure is associated with a substantial inter-observer variability. Furthermore, patients classified as histologic grade 2 has been reported to exhibit an intermediate recurrence risk, resulting in less prognostic value. With the aim of improving patient stratification, we have developed a model-based approach for histological grading using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this study, we developed a CNN model for improved histologic grading, with a focus on further stratification of grade 2 patients into high and low risk groups."
2020,A Semisupervised Learning Scheme with Self-Paced Learning for Classifying Breast Cancer Histopathological Images,"The unavailability of large amounts of well-labeled data poses a significant challenge in many medical imaging tasks. Even in the likelihood of having access to sufficient data, the process of accurately labeling the data is an arduous and time-consuming one, requiring expertise skills. Again, the issue of unbalanced data further compounds the abovementioned problems and presents a considerable challenge for many machine learning algorithms. In lieu of this, the ability to develop algorithms that can exploit large amounts of unlabeled data together with a small amount of labeled data, while demonstrating robustness to data imbalance, can offer promising prospects in building highly efficient classifiers. This work proposes a semisupervised learning method that integrates self-training and self-paced learning to generate and select pseudolabeled samples for classifying breast cancer histopathological images. A novel pseudolabel generation and selection algorithm is introduced in the learning scheme to generate and select highly confident pseudolabeled samples from both well-represented classes to less-represented classes. Such a learning approach improves the performance by jointly learning a model and optimizing the generation of pseudolabels on unlabeled-target data to augment the training data and retraining the model with the generated labels. A class balancing framework that normalizes the class-wise confidence scores is also proposed to prevent the model from ignoring samples from less represented classes (hard-to-learn samples), hence effectively handling the issue of data imbalance. Extensive experimental evaluation of the proposed method on the BreakHis dataset demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."
2020,RNA-Seq-Based Breast Cancer Subtypes Classification Using Machine Learning Approaches,"Background. Breast invasive carcinoma (BRCA) is not a single disease as each subtype has a distinct morphology structure. Although several computational methods have been proposed to conduct breast cancer subtype identification, the specific interaction mechanisms of genes involved in the subtypes are still incomplete. To identify and explore the corresponding interaction mechanisms of genes for each subtype of breast cancer can impose an important impact on the personalized treatment for different patients. Methods. We integrate the biological importance of genes from the gene regulatory networks to the differential expression analysis and then obtain the weighted differentially expressed genes (weighted DEGs). A gene with a high weight means it regulates more target genes and thus holds more biological importance. Besides, we constructed gene coexpression networks for control and experiment groups, and the significantly differentially interacting structures encouraged us to design the corresponding Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment based on gene coexpression networks (GOEGCN). The GOEGCN considers the two-side distinction analysis between gene coexpression networks for control and experiment groups. The method allows us to study how the modulated coexpressed gene couples impact biological functions at a GO level. Results. We modeled the binary classification with weighted DEGs for each subtype. The binary classifier could make a good prediction for an unseen sample, and the experimental results validated the effectiveness of our proposed approaches. The novel enriched GO terms based on GOEGCN for control and experiment groups of each subtype explain the specific biological function changes according to the two-side distinction of coexpression network structures to some extent. Conclusion. The weighted DEGs contain biological importance derived from the gene regulatory network. Based on the weighted DEGs, five binary classifiers were learned and showed good performance concerning the “Sensitivity,” “Specificity,” “Accuracy,” “F1,” and “AUC” metrics. The GOEGCN with weighted DEGs for control and experiment groups presented a novel GO enrichment analysis results and the novel enriched GO terms would further unveil the changes of specific biological functions among all the BRCA subtypes to some extent. The R code in this research is available at https://github.com/yxchspring/GOEGCN_BRCA_Subtypes."
2020,Learning Deep Features for Stain-free Live-dead Human Breast Cancer Cell Classification,"Abstract: Automated cell classification in cancer biology is a challenging topic in computer vision and machine learning research. Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women that usually involves phenotypically diverse populations of breast cancer cells and an heterogeneous stroma. In recent years, automated microscopy technologies are allowing the study of live cells over extended periods of time, simplifying the task of compiling large image databases. For instance, there have been several studies oriented towards building machine learning systems capable of automatically classifying images of different cell types (i.e. motor neurons, stem cells). In this work we were interested in classifying breast cancer cells as live or dead, based on a set of automatically retrieved morphological characteristics using image processing techniques. Our hypothesis is that live-dead classification can be performed without any staining and using only bright-field images as input. To our knowledge, there is no previous work attempting this task on in vitro studies of breast cancer cells, nor is there a dataset available to explore solutions related to this issue. We tackled this problem using the JIMT-1 breast cancer cell line that grows as an adherent monolayer. First, a vast image set composed by JIMT-1 human breast cancer cells that had been exposed to a chemotherapeutic drug treatment (doxorubicin and paclitaxel) or vehicle control was compiled. Next, several state-of-the-art classifiers were trained based on convolutional neural networks (CNN) to perform supervised classification using labels obtained from fluorescence microscopy images associated with each bright-field image. Model performances were evaluated and compared on a large number of bright-field images. The best model reached an AUC = 0.941 for classifying breast cancer cells without treatment. Furthermore, it reached AUC = 0.978 when classifying breast cancer cells under drug treatment. Our results highlight the potential of machine learning and computational image analysis to build new diagnosis tools that benefit the biomedical field by reducing cost, time, and stimulating work reproducibility. More importantly, we analyzed the way our classifiers clusterize bright-field images in the learned high-dimensional embedding and linked these groups to salient visual characteristics in live-dead cell biology observed by trained experts."
2021,Deep learning-based risk stratification for HER2-negative breast cancer patients,"ABSTRACT: In this paper, we present our analysis of the tumor microenvironment in digital pathology images to stratify risk in HER2-negative breast cancer patients using clinicopathological, spatial image, and cell-based features in a Cox’s proportional hazard model. We start the analysis by processing a set of 304 training pathology images using our in-house pan-cancer trained tumor, stroma, and lymphocyte region identification convolutional neural networks. The next step is computation of spatial regions of interest, namely: lymphocytes within (and adjacent to) tumor, lymphocytes within (and adjacent to) stroma, and stroma within (and adjacent to) tumor areas. Various cell-level information in these regions are then summarized, augmented to clinicopathological data, and linked to patient’s survival to train a Cox’s proportional hazards model. The proposed model outperformed a baseline model based on clinicopathological features only in analysis of an untouched test set of 202 whole slide images with p 8.49E-08 (HR = 0.4273)."
2023,Large language model (ChatGPT) as a support tool for breast tumor board,"Abstract: Large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT have gained public and scientific attention. The aim of this study is to evaluate ChatGPT as a support tool for breast tumor board decisions making. We inserted into ChatGPT-3.5 clinical information of ten consecutive patients presented in a breast tumor board in our institution. We asked the chatbot to recommend management. The results generated by ChatGPT were compared to the final recommendations of the tumor board. They were also graded independently by two senior radiologists. Grading scores were between 1–5 (1 = completely disagree, 5 = completely agree), and in three different categories: summarization, recommendation, and explanation. The mean age was 49.4, 8/10 (80%) of patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, one patient (1/10, 10%) had a ductal carcinoma in-situ and one patient (1/10, 10%) had a phyllodes tumor with atypia. In seven out of ten cases (70%), ChatGPT’s recommendations were similar to the tumor board’s decisions. Mean scores while grading the chatbot’s summarization, recommendation and explanation by the first reviewer were 3.7, 4.3, and 4.6 respectively. Mean values for the second reviewer were 4.3, 4.0, and 4.3, respectively. In this proof-of-concept study, we present initial results on the use of an LLM as a decision support tool in a breast tumor board. Given the significant advancements, it is warranted for clinicians to be familiar with the potential benefits and harms of the technology."
2020,Breast Cancer Mass Detection in DCE–MRI Using Deep-Learning Features Followed by Discrimination of Infiltrative vs. In Situ Carcinoma through a Machine-Learning Approach,"Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in women. This aggressive tumor can be categorized into two main groups—in situ and infiltrative, with the latter being the most common malignant lesions. The current use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was shown to provide the highest sensitivity in the detection and discrimination between benign vs. malignant lesions, when interpreted by expert radiologists. In this article, we present the prototype of a computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) system that could provide valuable assistance to radiologists for discrimination between in situ and infiltrating tumors. The system consists of two main processing levels—(1) localization of possibly tumoral regions of interest (ROIs) through an iterative procedure based on intensity values (ROI Hunter), followed by a deep-feature extraction and classification method for false-positive rejection; and (2) characterization of the selected ROIs and discrimination between in situ and invasive tumor, consisting of Radiomics feature extraction and classification through a machine-learning algorithm. The CAD system was developed and evaluated using a DCE–MRI image database, containing at least one confirmed mass per image, as diagnosed by an expert radiologist. When evaluating the accuracy of the ROI Hunter procedure with respect to the radiologist-drawn boundaries, sensitivity to mass detection was found to be 75%. The AUC of the ROC curve for discrimination between in situ and infiltrative tumors was 0.70."
2023,Construct ceRNA Network and Risk Model of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning Methods under the Mechanism of Cuproptosis,"Breast cancer (BRCA) has an undesirable prognosis and is the second most common cancer among women after lung cancer. A novel mechanism of programmed cell death called cuproptosis is linked to the development and spread of tumor cells. However, the function of cuproptosis in BRCA remains unknown. To this date, no studies have used machine learning methods to screen for characteristic genes to explore the role of cuproptosis-related genes (CRGs) in breast cancer. Therefore, 14 cuproptosis-related characteristic genes (CRCGs) were discovered by the feature selection of 39 differentially expressed CRGs using the three machine learning methods LASSO, SVM-RFE, and random forest. Through the PPI network and immune infiltration analysis, we found that PRNP was the key CRCG. The miRTarBase, TargetScan, and miRDB databases were then used to identify hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p as the upstream miRNA of PRNP, and the upstream lncRNA, CARMN, was identified by the StarBase database. Thus, the mRNA PRNP/miRNA hsa-miR-192-5p and hsa-miR-215-5p/lncRNA CARMN ceRNA network was constructed. This ceRNA network, which has not been studied before, is extremely innovative. Furthermore, four cuproptosis-related lncRNAs (CRLs) were screened in TCGA-BRCA by univariate Cox, LASSO, and multivariate Cox regression analysis. The risk model was constructed by using these four CRLs, and the risk score = C9orf163 * (1.8365) + PHC2-AS1 * (−2.2985) + AC087741.1 * (−0.9504) + AL109824.1 * (0.6016). The ROC curve and C-index demonstrated the superior predictive capacity of the risk model, and the ROC curve demonstrated that the AUC of 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS in all samples was 0.721, 0.695, and 0.633, respectively. Finally, 50 prospective sensitive medicines were screened with the pRRophetic R package, among which 17-AAG may be a therapeutic agent for high-risk patients, while the other 49 medicines may be suitable for the treatment of low-risk patients. In conclusion, our study constructs a new ceRNA network and a novel risk model, which offer a theoretical foundation for the treatment of BRCA and will aid in improving the prognosis of BRCA."
2019,The Revolutionizing Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Breast Cancer Management,NA
2021,A comparative analysis of machine learning approaches for prediction of breast cancer,"One of the most dreadful diseases for women and their health is breast cancer. Breast cancer death rates are higher than those for any other cancer, aside from lung cancer. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can be used to predict the early onset of breast cancer. The main objective of this analysis was to determine whether machine learning algorithms can be used to predict the onset of breast cancer with more than 90% accuracy. Based on research with supervised machine learning algorithms, Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Algorithm, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression were considered because they offer a wide variety of classification methods and also provide high accuracy and performance. We hypothesized that all these algorithms would provide accurate results, and Random Forest and Logistic Regression would provide better accuracy and performance than Naïve Bayes and K Nearest Neighbor. The Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset from the UC Irvine repository was used to perform a comparison between the supervised machine learning algorithms of Gaussian Naïve Bayes, K Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression. Based on the results, the Random Forest algorithm performed best among the four algorithms in malignant prediction (accuracy = 98%), and Logistic Regression algorithm performed best among the four algorithms in benign prediction (accuracy = 99%). All the algorithms performed well in the prediction of benign versus malignant cancer, with more than 90% accuracy based on their F1-score. The study results can be used for further research in prediction of cancer using machine learning algorithms."
2022,Artificial Intelligence Meets Whole Slide Images: Deep Learning Model Shapes an Immune-Hot Tumor and Guides Precision Therapy in Bladder Cancer,"Background. To construct and validate a deep learning cluster from whole slide images (WSI) for depicting the immunophenotypes and functional heterogeneity of the tumor microenvironment (TME) in patients with bladder cancer (BLCA) and to explore an artificial intelligence (AI) score to explore the underlying biological pathways in the developed WSI cluster. Methods. In this study, the WSI cluster was constructed based on a deep learning procedure. Further rerecognition of TME features in pathological images was applied based on a neural network. Then, we integrated the TCGA cohort and several external testing cohorts to explore and validate this novel WSI cluster and a corresponding quantitative indicator, the AI score. Finally, correlations between the AI cluster (AI score) and classical BLCA molecular subtypes, immunophenotypes, functional heterogeneity, and potential therapeutic method in BLCA were assessed. Results. The WSI cluster was identified associated with clinical survival ("
2023,BREAST CANCER DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH,"One of the most widespread diseases among women today is breast cancer. Early and accurate diagnosis is key in rehabilitation and treatment. The usage of mammograms has some uncertainties in the detection rate. To develop tools for physicians for effective and early detection and diagnosis, machine learning techniques can be adopted. The introduction of Machine Learning (ML) in developing the tool will increase the survival rate of patients with breast cancer. This research work proposed different six ML techniques; Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Decision Tree (DT), KNN, Naïve Bayes (NB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), and then recommended the model with the highest accuracy for breast cancer detection. The experiment was carried out in a python environment and all the aforementioned techniques were validated with Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and evaluated with accuracy, precision, and recall."
2022,The Efforts of Deep Learning Approaches for Breast Cancer Detection Based on X-Ray Images,"In this chapter, deep learning-based approaches, namely deep feature extraction, fine-tuning of pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNN), and end-to-end training of a developed CNN model, are used to classify the malignant and normal breast X-ray images. For deep feature extraction, pre-trained deep CNN models such as ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19 are used. For classification of the deep features, the support vector machines (SVM) classifier is used with various kernel functions namely linear, quadratic, cubic, and Gaussian, respectively. The aforementioned pre-trained deep CNN models are also used in fine-tuning procedure. A new CNN model is also proposed in end-to-end training fashion. The classification accuracy is used as performance measurements. The experimental works show that the deep learning has potential in detection of the breast cancer from the X-ray images. The deep features that are extracted from the ResNet50 model and SVM classifier with linear kernel function produced 94.7% accuracy score which the highest among all obtained."
2023,Noninvasive Staging of Lymph Node Status (NILS) in Breast Cancer using Machine Learning: External Validation and Further Model Development,"Background: Most patients diagnosed with breast cancer present with node-negative disease. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) is routinely used to stage the axilla, leaving patients with healthy axillary lymph nodes without therapeutic effects but at risk of morbidities from the intervention. Numerous studies have developed nodal (N) status prediction models for noninvasive axillary staging using postoperative data or imaging features that are not part of the diagnostic workup. Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) is a top-ranked predictor of N metastasis; however, it is challenging to assess preoperatively. Objective: To externally validate a multilayer perceptron (MLP) model for noninvasive lymph node staging (NILS) in a large population-based register cohort (n=18 633) while developing a new N MLP in the same cohort. Data were extracted from the Swedish National Quality Register for Breast Cancer (NKBC), 2014–2017, comprising only routinely and preoperatively available documented clinicopathological variables. Furthermore, we aimed to develop and validate an LVI MLP to predict missing values of LVI status to increase the preoperative feasibility of the original NILS model. Methods: Three non-overlapping cohorts were used for model development and validation. Four N MLPs and one LVI MLP were developed using 11–12 routinely available predictors. Results: External validation of the original NILS model was performed in NKBC (AUC 0.699, 95% CI: 0.690-0.708) with good calibration and the potential of sparing 16% of patients with node-negative disease from SLNB. The LVI model was externally validated (AUC 0.747, 95% CI: 0.694-0.799) with good calibration but did not improve the discriminatory performance of the N models. The new N model was developed in NKBC without information on LVI (AUC 0.709, 95% CI: 0.688-0.729) with excellent calibration in the hold-out internal validation cohort, resulting in the potential omission of 24% of patients from unnecessary SLNB. Conclusions: The NILS model was externally validated in NKBC, where the imputation of LVI status did not improve the model’s discriminatory performance. A new N model demonstrated the feasibility of using register data comprising only the variables available in the preoperative setting for NILS using machine learning. Future steps include ongoing preoperative validation of the NILS model and extending the model with, for example, mammography images. Trial Registration: Registered in the ISRCTN registry with study ID"
2019,Machine learning techniques for personalized breast cancer risk prediction: comparison with the BCRAT and BOADICEA models,"Background: Comprehensive breast cancer risk prediction models enable identifying and targeting women at high-risk, while reducing interventions in those at low-risk. Breast cancer risk prediction models used in clinical practice have low discriminatory accuracy (0.53–0.64). Machine learning (ML) offers an alternative approach to standard prediction modeling that may address current limitations and improve accuracy of those tools. The purpose of this study was to compare the discriminatory accuracy of ML-based estimates against a pair of established methods—the Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) and Breast and Ovarian Analysis of Disease Incidence and Carrier Estimation Algorithm (BOADICEA) models. Methods: We quantified and compared the performance of eight different ML methods to the performance of BCRAT and BOADICEA using eight simulated datasets and two retrospective samples: a random population-based sample of U.S. breast cancer patients and their cancer-free female relatives ( Results: Predictive accuracy (AU-ROC curve) reached 88.28% using ML-Adaptive Boosting and 88.89% using ML-random forest versus 62.40% with BCRAT for the U.S. population-based sample. Predictive accuracy reached 90.17% using ML-adaptive boosting and 89.32% using ML-Markov chain Monte Carlo generalized linear mixed model versus 59.31% with BOADICEA for the Swiss clinic-based sample. Conclusions: There was a striking improvement in the accuracy of classification of women with and without breast cancer achieved with ML algorithms compared to the state-of-the-art model-based approaches. High-accuracy prediction techniques are important in personalized medicine because they facilitate stratification of prevention strategies and individualized clinical management."
2023,Adversarial Attack and Defense in Breast Cancer Deep Learning Systems,"Deep-learning-assisted medical diagnosis has brought revolutionary innovations to medicine. Breast cancer is a great threat to women’s health, and deep-learning-assisted diagnosis of breast cancer pathology images can save manpower and improve diagnostic accuracy. However, researchers have found that deep learning systems based on natural images are vulnerable to attacks that can lead to errors in recognition and classification, raising security concerns about deep systems based on medical images. We used the adversarial attack algorithm FGSM to reveal that breast cancer deep learning systems are vulnerable to attacks and thus misclassify breast cancer pathology images. To address this problem, we built a deep learning system for breast cancer pathology image recognition with better defense performance. Accurate diagnosis of medical images is related to the health status of patients. Therefore, it is very important and meaningful to improve the security and reliability of medical deep learning systems before they are actually deployed."

Based on machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost, random forest, logistic regression, and K‐nearest neighbor, this paper establishes different models to classify and predict breast cancer, so as to provide a reference for the early diagnosis of breast cancer. Recall indicates the probability of detecting malignant cancer cells in medical diagnosis, which is of great significance for the classification of breast cancer, so this article takes recall as the primary evaluation index and considers the precision, accuracy, and"
2022,A machine learning model that identifies neoantigen-reactive CD8+ T cells in human gastrointestinal cancer,"Abstract: It appears that tumor-infiltrating neoantigen-reactive CD8 + T cells are the primary driver of immune responses to gastrointestinal cancer in patients. By mapping neoantigen-reactive T cells from the single-cell transcriptomes of thousands of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, we developed a 26-gene machine learning model for the identification of neoantigen-reactive T cells. In both training and test sets, the model performed admirably. We discovered, by applying the model to large-scale single-cell sequencing data of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells, that Neo T cells exhibited a hyperexpanded phenotype and two distinct differentiation pathways. Moreover, compared to non-neoantigen-reactive T cells, the majority of neoantigen-reactive T cells exhibited notable differences in the biological processes of locomotion and amide metabolism. The analysis of potential cell-to-cell interactions revealed that neoantigen-reactive T cells contain potent signaling molecules, such as CXCL13 and LTA, associated with the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures. This method expedites the identification of neoantigen-reactive TCRs and the engineering of neoantigen-reactive T cells for therapy."
2018,Prediction of prostate cancer by deep learning with multilayer artificial neural network,"Objectives: To predict the rate of prostate cancer detection on prostate biopsy more accurately, the performance of deep learning utilizing a multilayer artificial neural network was investigated. Materials and methods: A total of 334 patients who underwent multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging before ultrasonography-guided transrectal 12-core prostate biopsy were enrolled in the analysis. Twenty-two non-selected variables as well as selected ones by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and by stepwise logistic regression analysis were input into the constructed multilayer artificial neural network (ANN) programs. 232 patients were used as training cases of ANN programs, and the remaining 102 patients were for the test to output the probability of prostate cancer existence, accuracy of prostate cancer prediction, and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve with the learned model. Results: With any prostate cancer objective variable, Lasso and stepwise regression analyses selected 12 and 9 explanatory variables from 22, respectively. In common between them, age at biopsy, findings on digital rectal examination, findings in the peripheral zone on MRI diffusion-weighted imaging, and body mass index were positively influential variables, while numbers of previous prostatic biopsy and prostate volume were negatively influential. Using trained ANNs with multiple hidden layers, the accuracy of predicting any prostate cancer in test samples was about 5-10% higher compared with that with logistic regression analysis (LR). The AUCs with multilayer ANN were significantly larger on inputting variables that were selected by the stepwise logistic regression compared with the AUC with LR. The ANN had a higher net-benefit than LR between prostate cancer probability cut-off values of 0.38 and 0.6. Conclusion: ANN accurately predicted prostate cancer without biopsy marginally better than LR. However, for clinical application, ANN performance may still need improvement."
2023,Breast Cancer 6th Stage Prediction Based on Machine Learning Models,"The differences between each 6th stage of the breast cancer are subtle, and doctors’ judgement alone is not sufficient to determine the 6th stage accurately. 6th stage is the different levels of breast cancer development and it represents the current status of the cancer. Therefore, it is crucial to determine it correctly in order to conduct corresponding treatments. The incorrect categorization of the 6th stage and misuse of treatments can be catastrophic, and there are currently no such models to help doctors predicting the 6th stage. The dataset Seer Breast Cancer Data is used which include features like race, t-stage, n-stage, etc. This paper proposed to use random forest and K Nearest Neighbor (KNN) methods to build models and use features related to the patients and their cancer as training data. The random forest model achieved a predictive result of 99% for precision, recall, and f1 score after data normalization. The only mistake this model made is when differentiating stage IIIA and IIIB. The KNN model achieved an accuracy of 95% after normalization. The result shows that Random Forest model is best suited for predicting the 6th stage. The random forest model with 99% accuracy can effectively help doctors determine the 6th stage when they are having difficulties."

An introduction to deep learning in medical image processing from theoretical foundations to real-world applications. The article examines the general appeal of deep learning (DL), a collection of computer science advances. The next step was to learn the basics of neural networks. That explains the use of deep learning and CNNs. So we can see why deep learning is rapidly advancing in various application fields, including medical image processing. The goal of this research was to use innovative methodologies on cancer datasets to explore the feasibility of combining machine learning and deep learning algorithms for cancer detection. This study used text and picture databases to classify cancer. This article provides optimization methods that outperform the suggested approaches' accuracy. Using two alternative training methods, Levenberg Marquardt (lm) and Resilient back propagation (rp), two classification algorithms were evaluated with different groups of neurons to identify benign and malignant patients. Cascade correlation utilizing the train (rp) outperformed feed forward back propagation using the train (lm). The second deep neural network model presented a technique (based on CNN) for automated brain tumor identification using MRI data."
2022,An effective up-sampling approach for breast cancer prediction with imbalanced data: A machine learning model-based comparative analysis,"Early detection of breast cancer plays a critical role in successful treatment that saves thousands of lives of patients every year. Despite massive clinical data have been collected and stored by healthcare organizations, only a small portion of the data has been used to support decision-making for treatments. In this study, we proposed an engineered up-sampling method (ENUS) for handling imbalanced data to improve predictive performance of machine learning models. Our experiment results showed that when the ratio of the minority to the majority class is less than 20%, training models with ENUS improved the balanced accuracy 3.74%, sensitivity 8.36% and F1 score 3.83%. Our study also identified that XGBoost Tree ("
2021,Building Machine Learning Model for Predicting Breast Cancer Using different Regression Techniques,"Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the major life-threatening diseases in the world today. But early diagnosis would ensure timely treatment and even recovery. Apart from the medical procedures that help to identify cancer, techniques such as machine learning can be applied to predict the occurrence of the disease in patients by analyzing their cell data.

2022,Deep learning based on multi-omics integration identifies potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer,"Abstract: Effective and precise classification of breast cancer patients for their disease risks is critical to improve early diagnosis and patient survival. In the recent past, a significant amount of multi-omics data derived from cancer patients has emerged. However, a robust framework for integrating multi-omics data to subgroup cancer patients and predict survival prognosis is still lacking. In addition, effective therapeutic targets for treating breast cancer patients with poor prognoses are in dire need. To begin to resolve this difficulty, we developed and optimized a sophisticated deep learning-based model in breast cancer that can accurately stratify patients based on their prognosis. We built a survival-associated predictive framework integrating transcription profile, miRNA expression, somatic mutations, copy number variation, DNA methylation and protein expression. This framework achieved promising performance in distinguishing high-risk breast cancer patients from those with good prognoses. Furthermore, we constructed multiple fully connected neural networks that are trained on prioritized multi-omics signatures or even only potential single-omics signatures, based on our customized scoring system. Together, the landmark multi-omics signatures we identified may serve as potential therapeutic targets in breast cancer."
2021,Breast cancer analysis using Machine Learning algorithms,"Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common types of cancer and one of the leading causes of death for women around the world. Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast cells mutate and form a malignant tumor. State-of-the-art technologies can detect BC at an early stage, which helps in treatment and reduces the risk of death. Medical doctors commonly use breast tissue biopsy when diagnosing breast cancer, enabling them to take a microscopic look for breast tissue and determine whether the tissue is benign or malignant. To improve biopsy results, many researchers have studied the feasibility of using artificial intelligence (AI) to help doctors detect any harmful changes that may lead to cancer. In this research work detail analysis of Breast Cancer using support vector machine (SVM) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) algorithms is performed and the results show CNN has more superior results in comparison to SVM in the recognition of images affected by Breast Cancer."
2023,Identification of Novel Diagnostic and Prognostic Gene Signature Biomarkers for Breast Cancer Using Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Assisted Transcriptomics Analysis,"Background: Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most common female cancers. Clinical and histopathological information is collectively used for diagnosis, but is often not precise. We applied machine learning (ML) methods to identify the valuable gene signature model based on differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for BC diagnosis and prognosis. Methods: A cohort of 701 samples from 11 GEO BC microarray datasets was used for the identification of significant DEGs. Seven ML methods, including RFECV-LR, RFECV-SVM, LR-L1, SVC-L1, RF, and Extra-Trees were applied for gene reduction and the construction of a diagnostic model for cancer classification. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed for prognostic signature construction. The potential biomarkers were confirmed via qRT-PCR and validated by another set of ML methods including GBDT, XGBoost, AdaBoost, KNN, and MLP. Results: We identified 355 DEGs and predicted BC-associated pathways, including kinetochore metaphase signaling, PTEN, senescence, and phagosome-formation pathways. A hub of 28 DEGs and a novel diagnostic nine-gene signature (COL10A, S100P, ADAMTS5, WISP1, COMP, CXCL10, LYVE1, COL11A1, and INHBA) were identified using stringent filter conditions. Similarly, a novel prognostic model consisting of eight-gene signatures (CCNE2, NUSAP1, TPX2, S100P, ITM2A, LIFR, TNXA, and ZBTB16) was also identified using disease-free survival and overall survival analysis. Gene signatures were validated by another set of ML methods. Finally, qRT-PCR results confirmed the expression of the identified gene signatures in BC. Conclusion: The ML approach helped construct novel diagnostic and prognostic models based on the expression profiling of BC. The identified nine-gene signature and eight-gene signatures showed excellent potential in BC diagnosis and prognosis, respectively."
2023,Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning,"Abstract: Women die from breast cancer, which is an abstract concept. Breast cancer is the most important problem. The most frequent cancer in women diagnosed globally has now surpassed lung cancer in prevalence. early detection that aids in cancer prevention. If breast cancer is to have a very high survival rate, it must be found in its earliest stages. The efficient machine learning method is utilized to categorize the data.

Experimental results revealed that the proposed approach achieves promising results for the detection of malignant tumors of the breast on ultrasound images."
2022,A deep ensemble network model for classifying and predicting breast cancer,"Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. In most cases, the misinterpretation of medical diagnosis plays a vital role in increased fatality rates due to breast cancer. Breast cancer can be diagnosed by classifying tumors. There are two different types of tumors, such as malignant and benign tumors. Identifying the type of tumor is a tedious task, even for experts. Hence, an automated diagnosis is necessary. The role of machine learning in medical diagnosis is eminent as it provides more accurate results in classifying and predicting diseases. In this paper, we propose a deep ensemble network (DEN) method for classifying and predicting breast cancer. This method uses a stacked convolutional neural network, artificial neural network and recurrent neural network as the base classifiers in the ensemble. The random forest algorithm is used as the meta‐learner for providing the final prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed DEN technique outperforms all the existing approaches in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F‐score and area under the curve (AUC) measures. The analysis of variance test proves that the proposed DEN model is statistically more significant than the other existing classification models; thus, the proposed approach may aid in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer in women, hence aiding in the development of early treatment techniques to increase survival rate."

Further research focusing on model calibration and rigorous external clinical validation in real healthcare settings is imperative for ensuring its practical and reliable application in clinical practice."
2023,Research on Prediction of Breast Cancer Type using Machine Learning,"The most typical cancer type among women worldwide is breast cancer. In 2020 alone, it afflicts about 0.68 million people and 6.9% of all cancer cases. How to categorize tumors as benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) is one of the main obstacles to its diagnosis. This study helps to make an accurate and reliable diagnosis based on the initial data of the tumor, such as smoothness, texture, area using machine learning models. This study uses five machine learning models, Logistic Regression (RF), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbor (KNN), Naive Bayes Classifier (NBC) and three modelling systems, feature selection-ML and principal component analysis (PCA)-ML system to make predictions of the type of the tumor of Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. Model performance are assessed by three performance evaluation which are accuracy, precision, recall. The results of full model show that random forest has the highest prediction accuracy of 98.25% out of the sample and 100% in the sample, and SVM's sigmoid-based kernel model has the lowest prediction accuracy of 83.33% outside and 85.27% inside the sample. The results of the feature selection model based on RF and LR shows that the RF with only 13 variables has the highest prediction accuracy 98.25% out-of-sample and 100% in-sample. Among all the PCA--ML models, PCA--NBC has the highest prediction accuracy of 97.33% out-of-sample. Nevertheless, PCA-RF has the highest prediction accuracy of 100% in-sample."
2023,Applying machine learning models to breast cancer prediction problem,"Cancer has become the number one killer of human life and health. Therefore, a model that can predict cancer is able to help doctors to diagnose whether a patient has cancer or not, which can boost the accuracy of the diagnosis and enhance diagnostic efficiency, thus reducing the chance of misdiagnosis and other situations. This paper focuses on breast cancer prediction and adopted three machine learning based methods, including logistic regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, and decision tree models to build automatic solutions and investigate which model is more suitable for such a simple prediction problem. In this study, the detailed features, data collection and pre-processing approaches are presented to better understand such medical data. Then extensive experiments show that the accuracy scores of the three models are 97.08%, 94.89%, and 93.43%, respectively. Through comparison, it is concluded that the logistic regression model achieves the best performance for the breast cancer prediction task."
2022,Deep learning-based breast cancer disease prediction framework for medical industries,"Breast cancer is one among the dreadful cancer which is caused due to formation in breast cells. Earlier recognition of breast cancer is most required in the medical field to avoid the dangerous threat to human life. This is carried out in the existing work, namely Predictive Modeling Technique (PMT). Existing work cannot handle the database with noises properly which might lead to inaccurate prediction outcome. These problems are addressed by introducing Deep Learning-based Breast Cancer Disease Prediction Framework (DLBCDPF). The proposed research framework objective is to present the structures for the disease diagnosis in a further accurate way. In this work, feature selection is achieved through optimization algorithm, namely ranking-based bee colony approach by which the most optimal feature is chosen from the training dataset. The fitness values considered in this work for optimal feature selection are F-score values. Each feature’s F-score and N numbers of feature’s F-score are arranged in a descending manner; in addition, feature subset with more than one feature are produced. In this phase, diagnosis of various stomach-related problems is done through a unique hybridized classification methodology. In this hybridization methodology, clustering is accomplished before classification, and data pruning is attained in every classification iteration. This leads to improved classification accuracy owing to efficient diagnosis. The clustering is attained by fuzzy C-means clustering, and classification is done using the improved deep neural network.

Methods: Four powerful ML models were developed using data from male breast cancer (MBC) patients in the SEER database between 2010 and 2015 and MBC patients from our hospital between 2010 and 2020. The area under curve (AUC) and Brier score were used to assess the capacity of different models. The Delong test was applied to compare the performance of the models. Univariable and multivariable analysis were conducted using logistic regression. Results: Of 2351 patients were analyzed; 168 (7.1%) had distant metastasis (M1); 117 (5.0%) had bone metastasis, and 71 (3.0%) had lung metastasis. The median age at diagnosis is 68.0 years old. Most patients did not receive radiotherapy (1723, 73.3%) or chemotherapy (1447, 61.5%). The XGB model was the best ML model for predicting M1 in MBC patients. It showed the largest AUC value in the tenfold cross validation (AUC:0.884; SD:0.02), training (AUC:0.907; 95% CI: 0.899—0.917), testing (AUC:0.827; 95% CI: 0.802—0.857) and external validation (AUC:0.754; 95% CI: 0.739—0.771) sets. It also showed powerful ability in the prediction of bone metastasis (AUC: 0.880, 95% CI: 0.856—0.903 in the training set; AUC: 0.823, 95% CI:0.790—0.848 in the test set; AUC: 0.747, 95% CI: 0.727—0.764 in the external validation set) and lung metastasis (AUC: 0.906, 95% CI: 0.877—0.928 in training set; AUC: 0.859, 95% CI: 0.816—0.891 in the test set; AUC: 0.756, 95% CI: 0.732—0.777 in the external validation set). The AUC value of the XGB model was larger than that of nomogram in the training (0.907 vs 0.802) and external validation (0.754 vs 0.706) sets. Conclusions: The XGB model is a better predictor of distant metastasis among MBC patients than other ML models and nomogram; furthermore, the XGB model is a powerful model for predicting bone and lung metastasis. Combining with SHAP values, it could help doctors intuitively understand the impact of each variable on outcome."
2023,An integrative machine learning framework for classifying SEER breast cancer,"Abstract: Breast cancer is the commonest type of cancer in women worldwide and the leading cause of mortality for females. The aim of this research is to classify the alive and death status of breast cancer patients using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results dataset. Due to its capacity to handle enormous data sets systematically, machine learning and deep learning has been widely employed in biomedical research to answer diverse classification difficulties. Pre-processing the data enables its visualization and analysis for use in making important decisions. This research presents a feasible machine learning-based approach for categorizing SEER breast cancer dataset. Moreover, a two-step feature selection method based on Variance Threshold and Principal Component Analysis was employed to select the features from the SEER breast cancer dataset. After selecting the features, the classification of the breast cancer dataset is carried out using Supervised and Ensemble learning techniques such as Ada Boosting, XG Boosting, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes and Decision Tree. Utilizing the train-test split and k-fold cross-validation approaches, the performance of various machine learning algorithms is examined. The accuracy of Decision Tree for both train-test split and cross validation achieved as 98%. In this study, it is observed that the Decision Tree algorithm outperforms other supervised and ensemble learning approaches for the SEER Breast Cancer dataset."
2023,Improving the robustness and stability of a machine learning model for breast cancer prognosis through the use of multi-modal classifiers,"Abstract: Breast cancer is a deadly disease with a high mortality rate among PAN cancers. The advancements in biomedical information retrieval techniques have been beneficial in developing early prognosis and diagnosis systems for cancer patients. These systems provide the oncologist with plenty of information from several modalities to make the correct and feasible treatment plan for breast cancer patients and protect them from unnecessary therapies and their toxic side effects. The cancer patient’s related information can be collected using various modalities like clinical, copy number variation, DNA-methylation, microRNA sequencing, gene expression, and histopathological whole slide images. High dimensionality and heterogeneity in these modalities demand the development of some intelligent systems to understand related features to the prognosis and diagnosis of diseases and make correct predictions. In this work, we have studied some end-to-end systems having two main components : (a) dimensionality reduction techniques applied to original features from different modalities and (b) classification techniques applied to the fusion of reduced feature vectors from different modalities for automatic predictions of breast cancer patients into two categories: short-time and long-time survivors. Principal component analysis (PCA) and variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are used as the dimensionality reduction techniques, followed by support vector machines (SVM) or random forest as the machine learning classifiers. The study utilizes raw, PCA, and VAE extracted features of the TCGA-BRCA dataset from six different modalities as input to the machine learning classifiers. We conclude this study by suggesting that adding more modalities to the classifiers provides complementary information to the classifier and increases the stability and robustness of the classifiers. In this study, the multimodal classifiers have not been validated on primary data prospectively."

2022,Automatic Detection of Lung Cancer Using the Potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI),"The histopathology images are effective in identifying the location and level of cancer. In this chapter, a novel model is implemented for an automatic classification of histopathological images related to lung tissues. Initially, the color normalization technique is applied for improving the contrast of the histopathological images, which are acquired from the LC25000 lung histopathological image dataset. Additionally, the cancer segmentation is accomplished utilizing saliency driven region edge-based top-down level set (SDREL). Further, the feature descriptors—Alexnet and Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features—were used for extracting the feature vectors from the segmented histopathology images. Lastly, the enhanced grasshopper optimization algorithm (EGOA) and random forest classifier were used for optimal feature selection and lung tissue classification. The simulation result shows that the EGOA-random forest model obtained 98.50% of accuracy on the LC25000 lung histopathological image dataset."
