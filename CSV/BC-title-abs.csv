Chuan Liu,Image classification of breast cancer based on contrastive learning and reconstruction loss of local attention enhancement,Breast cancer poses a significant threat to women's health- being a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among female population. In recent years- machine learning has emerged as a promising approach in medical field- particularly in detection and classification tasks. However- existing algorithms often exhibit suboptimal accuracy- necessitating improved methodologies. This research presents a novel approach using a Modified Support Vector Machine (MSVM) for breast cancer classification into benign and malignant categories. Leveraging the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset (WBCD)- preprocessing techniques are applied to enhance data quality. Principle Component Analysis (PCA) reduces dimensionality- while linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) extracts discriminative features crucial for classification. The proposed MSVM classifier achieves exceptional performance- with a classification accuracy of 99.42%- outperforming other existing methods such as Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Fuzzy Rule-based Systems. These results highlight the efficacy of the MSVM approach in accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant breast cancer cases- showcasing its potential as a reliable tool for medical image analysis and cancer diagnosis.
I. Taraniya- Bhaskar Reddy P.V.- Yeddula Divyasri- Varshini Chaithra- Nalam Lakshmi Raviteja,Machine learning based breast cancer detection using logistic regression,Abstract: Mammography plays a crucial role in breast cancer (BC) risk assessment. Recent breakthroughs show that deep learning (DL) in mammography is expanding from diagnosis to effective risk prediction. Moreover- the brightest mammographic breast density (MBD)- termed â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´cirrocumulus-â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ signifies an authentic risk. Addressing the challenges in quantifying above recent measures- we present MIDAS: a DL-derived system for multi-level MBD and risk feature score (FS). Using >260-000 multicenter images from South Korea and the US- FS consistently outperforms conventional MBD metrics in risk stratification. Only within the high FS- cirrocumulus further enriches assessment- pinpointing â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´double-higherâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ subgroup. Their risk profiles are notable: women in double upper-tertile showed OR=10.20 for Koreans and 5.67 for US- and OR=7.09 for scree-detected cases (US only). We also reveals the â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´black-boxâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ nature of FS that it predominantly captures complex patterns of higher-intensity MBD. Our research enhances the potential of digital mammography in identifying individuals at elevated BC risks.

F Abdullakutty- Y Akbari- S Al-Maadeed- ...,Advancing Histopathology-Based Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Insights into Multi-Modality and Explainability,The most common route of breast cancer metastasis is through the mammary lymphatic network. An accurate assessment of the axillary lymph node (ALN) burden before surgery can avoid unnecessary axillary surgery- consequently preventing surgical complications. In this study- we aimed to develop a non-invasive prediction model incorporating breast specific gamma image (BSGI) features and ultrasonographic parameters to assess axillary lymph node status. Cohorts of breast cancer patients who underwent surgery between 2012 and 2021 were created (The training set included 1104 ultrasound images and 940 BSGI images from 235 patients- the test set included 568 ultrasound images and 296 BSGI images from 99 patients) for the development of the prediction model. six machine learning (ML) methods and recursive feature elimination were trained in the training set to create a strong prediction model. Based on the best-performing model- we created an online calculator that can make a linear predictor in patients easily accessible to clinicians. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and calibration curve are used to verify the model performance respectively and evaluate the clinical effectiveness of the model. Six ultrasonographic parameters (transverse diameter of tumour- longitudinal diameter of tumour- lymphatic echogenicity- transverse diameter of lymph nodes- longitudinal diameter of lymph nodes- lymphatic color Doppler flow imaging grade) and one BSGI features (axillary mass status) were selected based on the best-performing model. In the test set- the support vector machines' model showed the best predictive ability (AUCâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.794- sensitivityâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.641- specificityâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.8- PPVâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.676- NPVâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.774 and accuracyâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.737). An online calculator was established for clinicians to predict patients' risk of ALN metastasis ( https://wuqian.shinyapps.io/shinybsgi/ ). The result in ROC showed the model could benefit from incorporating BSGI feature. This study developed a non-invasive prediction model that incorporates variables using ML method and serves to clinically predict ALN metastasis and help in selection of the appropriate treatment option.

We construct and validate the performance of modality-specific enhancement (MSE)-Breast Net based on multimodal ultrasound images and compare it to the BI-RADS in differentiating adenosis from breast cancer. A total of 179 patients with breast carcinoma and 229 patients with adenosis were included in this retrospective- two-institution study- then divided into a training cohort (institution I- nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 292) and a validation cohort (institution II- nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 116).

NA Chowdhury- L Wang- L Gu- ...,Machine Learning for Early Breast Cancer Detection,The volatility of global energy markets- particularly electricity prices- plays a crucial role in influencing international economic activities. In the era of big data- machine learning has revolutionized the field of cancer research- particularly in analyzing gene expression data. This study explores the application of machine learning models to the GSE45827 dataset- which contains breast cancer gene expression profiles. With over 54-000 genes and 151 samples categorized into six classes- the dataset presents a high-dimensional challenge that is addressed using dimensionality reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). The PCA method proved most effective in retaining the critical features of the data in lower dimensions- allowing for clearer visualization and enhanced model performance. The reduced dataset was then classified using the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model- achieving promising multi-class classification results. The model demonstrated high precision- recall- and F1-scores across several classes- particularly exc elling in classes 1- 2- and 5. However- certain classes- such as 0 and 4- exhibited lower recall- highlighting areas for further refinement. The integration of PCA and XGBoost not only improved the interpretability and computational efficiency of the model but also contributed to the accurate identification of breast cancer subtypes- emphasizing the importance of machine learning in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
KM Boehm- OSM El Nahhas- A Marra- P Selenica- ...,Multimodal histopathologic models stratify hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer,Breast cancer risk prediction models based on common clinical risk factors are used to identify women eligible for high-risk screening and prevention. Unfortunately- these models have only modest discriminatory accuracy with disparities in performance in underrepresented race and ethnicity groups. The field of artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning are rapidly advancing the field of breast cancer risk prediction with the development of mammography-based AI breast cancer risk models. Early studies suggest mammography-based AI risk models may perform better than traditional risk factor-based models with more equitable performance.

Timely detection of such cancer types is crucial- and recent research- employing deep learning techniques- shows promise in earlier detection. The research focuses on the early detection of such tumors using mammogram images with deep-learning models. The paper utilized four public databases where a similar amount of 986 mammograms each for three classes (normal- benign- malignant) are taken for evaluation. Herein- three deep CNN models such as VGG-11- Inception v3- and ResNet50 are employed as base classifiers. The research adopts an ensemble method where the proposed approach makes use of the modified Gompertz function for building a fuzzy ranking of the base classification models and their decision scores are integrated in an adaptive manner for constructing the final prediction of results. The classification results of the proposed fuzzy ensemble approach outperform transfer learning models and other ensemble approaches such as weighted average and Sugeno integral techniques. The proposed ResNet50 ensemble network using the modified Gompertz function-based fuzzy ranking approach provides a superior classification accuracy of 98.986%.
Jiarui Li,Evaluative Comparison of Machine Learning Algorithms for Precision Diagnosis in Breast Cancer,We aim to develop new portable desktop tissue analysers (DTAs) to provide fast- low-cost- and precise test results for fast nanomechanical profiling of tumours. This paper will explain the reasoning for choosing indentation-type atomic force microscopy (IT-AFM) to reveal the functional details of cancer. Determining the subtype- cancer stage- and prognosis will be possible- which aids in choosing the best treatment. DTAs are based on fast IT-AFM at the size of a small box that can be made for a low budget compared to other clinical imaging tools. The DTAs can work in remote areas and all parts of the world. There are a number of direct benefits: First- it is no longer needed to wait a week for the pathology report as the test will only take 10 min. Second- it avoids the complicated steps of making histopathology slides and saves costs of labour. Third- computers and robots are more consistent- more reliable- and more economical than human workers which may result in fewer diagnostic errors. Fourth- the IT-AFM analysis is capable of distinguishing between various cancer subtypes. Fifth- the IT-AFM analysis could reveal new insights about why immunotherapy fails. Sixth- IT-AFM may provide new insights into the neoadjuvant treatment response. Seventh- the healthcare system saves money by reducing diagnostic backlogs. Eighth- the results are stored on a central server and can be accessed to develop strategies to prevent cancer. To bring the IT-AFM technology from the bench to the operation theatre- a fast IT-AFM sensor needs to be developed and integrated into the DTAs.

J Dong- W Huang- J Zhang,Identification of Key Features in Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Vision Transformer,Accurate segmentation of the clinical target volume (CTV) of CBCT images can observe the changes of CTV during patients' radiotherapy- and lay a foundation for the subsequent implementation of adaptive radiotherapy (ART). However- segmentation is challenging due to the poor quality of CBCT images and difficulty in obtaining target volumes. An uncertainty estimation- and attention-based semi-supervised model called residual convolutional block attention-uncertainty aware mean teacher (RCBA-UAMT) was proposed to delineate the CTV in cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images of breast cancer automatically. A total of 60 patients who undergone radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery were enrolled in this study- which involved 60 planning CTs and 380 CBCTs. RCBA-UAMT was proposed by integrating residual and attention modules in the backbone network 3D UNet. The attention module can adjust channel and spatial weights of the extracted image features. The proposed design can train the model and segment CBCT images with a small amount of labeled data (5%- 10%- and 20%) and a large amount of unlabeled data. Four types of evaluation metrics- namely- dice similarity coefficient (DSC)- Jaccard- average surface distance (ASD)- and 95% Hausdorff distance (95HD)- are used to assess the model segmentation performance quantitatively. The proposed method achieved average DSC- Jaccard- 95HD- and ASD of 82%- 70%- 8.93- and 1.49Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm for CTV delineation on CBCT images of breast cancer- respectively. Compared with the three classical methods of mean teacher- uncertainty-aware mean-teacher and uncertainty rectified pyramid consistency- DSC and Jaccard increased by 7.89-9.33% and 14.75-16.67%- respectively- while 95HD and ASD decreased by 33.16-67.81% and 36.05-75.57%- respectively. The comparative experiment results of the labeled data with different proportions (5%- 10% and 20%) showed significant differences in the DSC- Jaccard- and 95HD evaluation indexes in the labeled data with 5% versus 10% and 5% versus 20%. Moreover- no significant differences were observed in the labeled data with 10% versus 20% among all evaluation indexes. Therefore- we can use only 10% labeled data to achieve the experimental objective. Using the proposed RCBA-UAMT- the CTV of breast cancer CBCT images can be delineated reliably with a small amount of labeled data. These delineated images can be used to observe the changes in CTV and lay the foundation for the follow-up implementation of ART.
Koagne Longpa T. Silas,Breast Cancer Diagnosis with Machine Learning Using Feed-Forward Multilayer Perceptron Analog Artificial Neural Network,OBJECTIVES:: This study explores a deep learning (DL) approach to predicting bone metastases in breast cancer (BC) patients using clinical information- such as the fat index- and features like Computed Tomography (CT) images. METHODS:: CT imaging data and clinical information were collected from 431 BC patients who underwent radical surgical resection at Harbin Medical University Cancer Hospital. The area of muscle and adipose tissue was obtained from CT images at the level of the eleventh thoracic vertebra. The corresponding histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) and local binary pattern (LBP) features were extracted from the CT images- and the network features were derived from the LBP and HOG features as well as the CT images through deep learning (DL). The combination of network features with clinical information was utilized to predict bone metastases in BC patients using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm. Regularized Cox regression models were employed to identify independent prognostic factors for bone metastasis. RESULTS:: The combination of clinical information and network features extracted from LBP features- HOG features- and CT images using a convolutional neural network (CNN) yielded the best performance- achieving an AUC of 0.922 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.843â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.964- [Formula: see text] 0.01). Regularized Cox regression results indicated that the subcutaneous fat index was an independent prognostic factor for bone metastasis in breast cancer (BC). CONCLUSION:: Subcutaneous fat index could predict bone metastasis in BC patients. Deep learning multimodal algorithm demonstrates superior performance in assessing bone metastases in BC patients.
J Rui,Artificial Intelligence in Bioengineering: Improving the Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Cancer,To develop a MRI-based radiomics model- integrating the intratumoral and peritumoral imaging information to predict axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in patients with breast cancer and to elucidate the model's decision-making process via interpretable algorithms. This study included 376 patients from three institutions who underwent contrast-enhanced breast MRI between 2021 and 2023. We used multiple machine learning algorithms to combine peritumoral- intratumoral- and radiological characteristics with the building of radiological- radiomics- and combined models. The model's performance was compared based on the area under the curve (AUC) obtained from the receiver operating characteristic analysis and interpretable machine learning techniques to analyze the operating mechanism of the model. The radiomics model- incorporating features from both intratumoral tissue and the 3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral region and utilizing the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm- demonstrated superior diagnostic efficacy- achieving an AUC of 0.820. The AUC of the combination of the RAD score- clinical T stage- and spiculated margin was as high as 0.855. Furthermore- we conducted SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to evaluate the contributions of RAD score- clinical T stage- and spiculated margin in ALNM status prediction. The interpretable radiomics model we propose can better predict the ALNM status of breast cancer and help inform clinical treatment decisions.
T Liu- H Wang- F Feng- W Li- F Zheng- K Wu- ...,â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Ã‡ clinicopathologic information and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI for augmented prediction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy response in breast cancer,Breast UltraSound (BUS) imaging is a commonly used diagnostic tool in the field of counter fighting breast diseases- especially for early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. Due to the inherent characteristics of ultrasound images such as blurry boundaries and diverse tumor morphologies- it is challenging for doctors to manually segment breast tumors. In recent years- the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology has been widely applied to automatically segment BUS images. However- due to the inherent limitations of CNNs in capturing global contextual information- it is difficult to capture the full context. To address this issue- the paper proposes a novel BGRD-TransUNet model for breast lesion segmentation- based on TransUNet. The proposed model- first- replaces the original ResNet50 backbone network of TransUNet with DenseNet121 for initial feature extraction. Next- newly designed Residual Multi-Scale Feature Modules (RMSFMs) are employed to extract features from various layers of DenseNet121- thus capturing richer features within specific layers. Thirdly- a Boundary Guidance (BG) network is added to enhance the contour information of BUS images. Additionally- newly designed Boundary Attentional Feature Fusion Modules (BAFFMs) are used to integrate edge information and features extracted through RMSFMs. Finally- newly designed Parallel Channel and Spatial Attention Modules (PCSAMs) are used to refine feature extraction using channel and spatial attention. An extensive experimental testing performed on two public datasets demonstrates that the proposed BGRD-TransUNet model outperforms all state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models- participating in the experiments- according to all evaluation metrics used (except for few separate cases)- including the two most important and widely used metrics in the field of medical image segmentation- namely the Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). More specifically- on the BUSI dataset and dataset B- BGRD-TransUNet achieves IoU values of 76.77% and 86.61%- and DSC values of 85.08% and 92.47%- respectively- which are higher by 7.27 and 3.64- and 5.81 and 2.54 percentage points- than the corresponding values achieved by the baseline (TransUNet).

Methods Sixty-five radiologists- breast physicians and radiology trainees participated in an online survey that consisted of 23 multiple choice questions asking about their experience and familiarity with AI products. Furthermore- the survey asked about their confidence in using AI outputs and their preference for AI modes applied in a breast screening context. Participants' responses to questions were compared using Pearson's â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬âˆž 2 test. Bonferroni-adjusted significance tests were used for pairwise comparisons. Results Fifty-five percent of respondents had experience with AI in their workplaces- with automatic density measurement powered by machine learning being the most familiar AI product (69.4%). The top AI outputs with the highest ranks of perceived confidence were 'Displaying suspicious areas on mammograms with the percentage of cancer possibility' (67.8%) and 'Automatic mammogram classification (normal- benign- cancer- uncertain)' (64.6%). Radiology and breast physicians preferred using AI as second-reader mode (75.4% saying 'somewhat happy' to 'extremely happy') over triage (47.7%)- pre-screening and first-reader modes (both with 26.2%) (P â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001). Conclusion The majority of screen readers expressed increased confidence in utilising AI for highlighting suspicious areas on mammograms and for automatically classifying mammograms. They considered AI as an optimal second-reader mode being the most ideal use in a screening program. The findings provide valuable insights into the familiarities and expectations of radiologists and breast clinicians for the AI products that can enhance the effectiveness of the breast cancer screening programs- benefitting both healthcare professionals and patients alike.

M Tafavvoghi- A Sildnes- M Rakaee- N Shvetsov- ...,Deep learning-based classification of breast cancer molecular subtypes from H&E whole-slide images,Breast cancer is the most common cancer type in women worldwide. Early detection and appropriate treatment can significantly reduce its impact. While histopathology examinations play a vital role in rapid and accurate diagnosis- they often require experienced medical experts for proper recognition and cancer grading. Automated image retrieval systems have the potential to assist pathologists in identifying cancerous tissues- thereby accelerating the diagnostic process. Nevertheless- proposing an accurate image retrieval model is challenging due to considerable variability among the tissue and cell patterns in histological images. In this work- we leverage the features from foundation models in a novel attention-based adversarially regularized variational graph autoencoder model for breast histological image retrieval. Our results confirm the superior performance of models trained with foundation model features compared to those using pre-trained convolutional neural networks (up to 7.7% and 15.5% for mAP and mMV- respectively)- with the pre-trained general-purpose self-supervised model for computational pathology (UNI) delivering the best overall performance. By evaluating two publicly available histology image datasets of breast cancer- our top-performing model- trained with UNI features- achieved average mAP/mMV scores of 96.7%/91.5% and 97.6%/94.2% for the BreakHis and BACH datasets- respectively. Our proposed retrieval model has the potential to be used in clinical settings to enhance diagnostic performance and ultimately benefit patients.

MAK Raiaan- NM Fahad- MSH Mukta- ...,Mammo-Light: A lightweight convolutional neural network for diagnosing breast cancer from mammography images,To investigate the feasibility of an artificial intelligence (AI)-based semi-automated segmentation for the extraction of ultrasound (US)-derived radiomics features in the characterization of focal breast lesions (FBLs). Two expert radiologists classified according to US BI-RADS criteria 352 FBLs detected in 352 patients (237 at Center A and 115 at Center B). An AI-based semi-automated segmentation was used to build a machine learning (ML) model on the basis of B-mode US of 237 images (center A) and then validated on an external cohort of B-mode US images of 115 patients (Center B). A total of 202 of 352 (57.4%) FBLs were benign- and 150 of 352 (42.6%) were malignant. The AI-based semi-automated segmentation achieved a success rate of 95.7% for one reviewer and 96% for the other- without significant difference (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.839). A total of 15 (4.3%) and 14 (4%) of 352 semi-automated segmentations were not accepted due to posterior acoustic shadowing at B-Mode US and 13 and 10 of them corresponded to malignant lesions- respectively. In the validation cohort- the characterization made by the expert radiologist yielded values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.933- 0.9- 0.857- 0.955- respectively. The ML model obtained values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.544- 0.6- 0.416- 0.628- respectively. The combined assessment of radiologists and ML model yielded values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.756- 0.928- 0.872- 0.855- respectively. AI-based semi-automated segmentation is feasible- allowing an instantaneous and reproducible extraction of US-derived radiomics features of FBLs. The combination of radiomics and US BI-RADS classification led to a potential decrease of unnecessary biopsy but at the expense of a not negligible increase of potentially missed cancers.

P Yan- W Gong- M Li- J Zhang- X Li- Y Jiang- H Luo- ...,TDF-Net: Trusted Dynamic Feature Fusion Network for breast cancer diagnosis using incomplete multimodal ultrasound,In patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)- quantitative ultrasound (QUS) radiomics can predict final responses early within 4 of 16-18 weeks of treatment. The current study was planned to study the feasibility of a QUS-radiomics model-guided adaptive chemotherapy. The phase 2 open-label randomized controlled trial included patients with LABC planned for NAC. Patients were randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio to a standard arm or experimental arm stratified by hormonal receptor status. All patients were planned for standard anthracycline and taxane-based NAC as decided by their medical oncologist. Patients underwent QUS imaging using a clinical ultrasound device before the initiation of NAC and after the 1st and 4th weeks of treatment. A support vector machine-based radiomics model developed from an earlier cohort of patients was used to predict treatment response at the 4th week of NAC. In the standard arm- patients continued to receive planned chemotherapy with the treating oncologists blinded to results. In the experimental arm- the QUS-based prediction was conveyed to the responsible oncologist- and any changes to the planned chemotherapy for predicted non-responders were made by the responsible oncologist. All patients underwent surgery following NAC- and the final response was evaluated based on histopathological examination. Between June 2018 and July 2021- 60 patients were accrued in the study arm- with 28 patients in each arm available for final analysis. In patients without a change in chemotherapy regimen (53 of 56 patients total)- the QUS-radiomics model at week 4 of NAC that was used demonstrated an accuracy of 97%- respectively- in predicting the final treatment response. Seven patients were predicted to be non-responders (observational arm (n=2)- experimental arm (n=5)). Three of 5 non-responders in the experimental arm had chemotherapy regimens adapted with an early initiation of taxane therapy or chemotherapy intensification- or early surgery and ended up as responders on final evaluation. The study demonstrates the feasibility of QUS-radiomics adapted guided NAC for patients with breast cancer. The ability of a QUS-based model in the early prediction of treatment response was prospectively validated in the current study. clinicaltrials.gov- ID NCT04050228.

A Alhussen- MA Haq- AA Khan- RK Mahendran- ...,XAI-RACapsNet: Relevance aware capsule network-based breast cancer detection using mammography images via explainability O-net ROI segmentation,Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent and fatal forms of cancer in India. It ranks the second most common cancer in rural areas and the most common in urban areas. According to a report by the International Agency for Research on Cancer- there were over 2.26 million new breast cancer cases and nearly 685-000 deaths from breast cancer globally. With a significant portion of India's population being young- the number of women diagnosed with breast cancer is expected to increase- reaching alarming levels due to a lack of awareness and delays in diagnosis. While breast cancer cannot be prevented- early detection and timely treatment can significantly improve survival rates.

Michele Zeverino- Wendy Jeanneret-Sozzi- Francois Bochud- Raphael Moeckli,674: Automated right-sided breast planning via deep-learning left-sided model adaptation.,Breast cancer is a significant worldwide public health concern- and increasing patient survival rates requires early identification and precise prognosis. This research investigated a dataset on breast cancer to assess and compare the efficacy of three machine learning algorithms in the prediction of breast cancer: Support Vector Machine (SVM)- Naive Bayes (NB)- and Logistic Regression (LR). The findings demonstrated that the LR method provided good interpretability and computational efficiency- the NB algorithm excelled in computational efficiency- and the SVM algorithm performed best when processing high-dimensional data. Based on the findings- the paper recommend prioritizing the SVM algorithm for scenarios requiring high accuracy in breast cancer detection. Future research directions include enhancing model robustness through ensemble learning and optimizing feature selection. This study provides significant insights for early breast cancer detection- offering important clinical application value.
M. Sarafidis- E.G. Sifakis- J. Bergh- T. Foukakis- A.

Sex hormones were determined on urine samples collected from 250 post-menopausal women (65 healthy - 185 with breast cancer- recruited among the clinical patients of Candiolo Cancer Institute FPO-IRCCS (Torino- Italy). Two analytical procedures based on UHPLC-MS/HRMS were developed and comprehensively validated to quantify 20 free and conjugated sex hormones from urine samples. The quantitative data were processed by seven machine learning algorithms. The efficiency of the resulting models was compared. Among the tested models aimed to relate urinary estrogen and androgen levels and the occurrence of breast cancer- Random Forest (RF) proved to underscore all the other supervised classification approaches- including Partial Least Squares - Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA)- in terms of effectiveness and robustness. The final optimized model built on only five biomarkers (testosterone-sulphate- alpha-estradiol- 4-methoxyestradiol- DHEA-sulphate- and epitestosterone-sulphate) achieved an approximate 98% diagnostic accuracy on replicated validation sets. To balance the less-represented population of healthy women- a Synthetic Minority Oversampling TEchnique (SMOTE) data oversampling approach was applied. By means of tunable hyperparameters optimization- the RF algorithm showed great potential for early breast cancer detection- as it provides clear biomarkers ranking and their relative efficiency- allowing to ground the final diagnostic model on a restricted selection five steroid biomarkers only- as desirable for noninvasive tests with wide screening purposes.

Particularly in women- the incidence of breast cancer is rising daily because of ignorance and delayed diagnosis. Only by correctly identifying and diagnosing cancer in its very early stages of development can be effectively treated. The classification of cancer can be accelerated and automated with the aid of computer-aided diagnosis and medical image analysis techniques. This research provides the use of transfer learning from a Residual Network 18 (ResNet18) and Residual Network 34 (ResNet34) architectures to detect breast cancer. The study examined how breast cancer can be identified in breast mammography pictures using transfer learning from ResNet18 and ResNet34- and developed a demo app for radiologists using the trained models with the best validation accuracy. 1- 200 datasets of breast x-ray mammography images from the National Radiological Society's (NRS) archives were employed in the study. The dataset was categorised as implant cancer negative- implant cancer positive- cancer negative and cancer positive in order to increase the consistency of x-ray mammography images classification and produce better features. For the multi-class classification of the images- the study gave an average accuracy for binary classification of benign or malignant cancer cases of 86.7% validation accuracy for ResNet34 and 92% validation accuracy for ResNet18. A prototype web application showcasing ResNet18 performance has been created. The acquired results show how transfer learning can improve the accuracy of breast cancer detection- providing invaluable assistance to medical professionals- particularly in an African scenario.

Gouveia,Breast tissue segmentation in MR images using deep-learning,Breast cancer is one of the malignancies that affects women. Breast cancer is a condition that is brought on by abnormal breast cells that multiply and form tumours. If left untreated- tumours have the capacity to grow throughout the body and become fatal. Early initiation and thorough completion of treatment is associated with better outcomes and greater patient tolerance for breast cancer patients. These days- early detection of breast cancer is quite helpful and will help the women who battle the illness. The earliest detection of breast cancer can be successfully achieved with the use of machine learning-based approaches. Breast cancer can be diagnosed with great accuracy using a number of machine learning techniques- including CNN- RF- SVM- NB- KNN- AB- and others. Thus- I am introducing a triple hybrid deep learning method for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This is the CNN- GRU- and LSTM combination.
ArunaDevi Karuppasamy- Abdelhamid Abdesselam- Hamza zidoum- Rachid Hedjam- Maiya Al-Bahri,Combining a forward supervised filter learning with a sparse NMF for breast cancer histopathological image classification,Breast cancer remains a global health problem requiring effective diagnostic methods for early detection in order to achieve WHO&rsquo;s ultimate goal of breast self-examination (BSE). A literature review indicates the urgency of improving diagnostic methods and identifies thermography as a promising- cost-effective- and non-invasive and adjunctive and complementary detection method. This research explores the potential of using machine learning (ML) techniques- specifically Bayesian Networks (BN) combined with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to improve breast cancer diagnosis at early stages. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) aims to clarify the reasoning behind any output of artificial neural networks based models. The proposed integration adds interpretability of the diagnosis- which is particularly significant for a medical diagnosis. We have constructed two diagnostic expert models. In research model A- combining thermal images after XAI process together with medical records- an accuracy of 84.07% has been achieved- while model B- that includes also CNN prediction- achieved an accuracy of 90.93%. These results demonstrate the potential of XAI to transform breast cancer diagnosis- increasing accuracy and reducing the risk of misdiagnosis.
Ujjwal Jain- Rudra Pratap Singh- Satyam Rastogi- Shashank Gautam- Pranshu Saxena- Tanaya Gupta,Computer-assisted classification Breast Cancer Classifier using Machine learning techniques,"Background: Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in women. Mammograms are the most used method of screening; however, this technique has limited sensitivity. According to the USPSTF, the screening age for breast cancer in the US has reduced by 10 years which will produce thousands more images, increasing the demand on radiologists. Aim: AI algorithms aim to assist radiologists and detect cancers that would have otherwise been missed. The aim of the integration of AI into screening is to enable quicker breast cancer detection, leading to earlier treatment which may include surgery in some cases. Results: Recent studies which compare the performance of Deep learning, Convolutional neural network (ResNET) models with radiologists in breast cancer screening, have shown an increased accuracy of malignancy detection when radiologists read images in combination with AI than radiologists reading the scans alone. Discussion: Radiogenomics could be utilised to predict the likelihood of patients developing breast cancer, taking into consideration patient factors and image data, aiming towards precision medicine. However, there are some limitations with the use of AI in the screening programme, such as access to large quality data, data privacy, transparency and explainability. Conclusions: AI has the potential to shift breast cancer detection to a more proactive than reactive approach, increasing the speed and accuracy of diagnosis and contributing to the establishment of a more patient-centred approach to treatment."

Vedagiriswaran N- SHRIHARI KAMALAN KUMARAGURUPARAN- Kumara  Guru R,Machine Learning and Structural Informatics Approaches to Identify Mtor Inhibitors for Drug Repurposing in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer,Early detection significantly enhances patients' survival rates by identifying tumors in their initial stages through medical imaging. However- prevailing methodologies encounter challenges in extracting comprehensive information from diverse modalities- thereby exacerbating semantic disparities and overlooking critical task correlations- consequently compromising the accuracy of prognosis predictions. Moreover- clinical insights emphasize the advantageous sharing of parameters between tumor segmentation and survival prediction for enhanced prognostic accuracy. This paper proposes a novel model- BTSSPro- designed to concurrently address Breast cancer Tumor Segmentation and Survival prediction through a Prompt-guided multi-modal co-learning framework. Technologically- our approach involves the extraction of tumor-specific discriminative features utilizing shared dual attention (SDA) blocks- which amalgamate spatial and channel information from breast MR images. Subsequently- we employ a guided fusion module (GFM) to seamlessly integrate the Electronic Health Record (EHR) vector into the extracted tumor-related discriminative feature representations. This integration prompts the model's feature selection to align more closely with real-world scenarios. Finally- a feature harmonic unit (FHU) is introduced to coordinate the transformer encoder and CNN decoder- thus reducing semantic differences. Remarkably- BTSSPro achieved a C-index of 0.968 and Dice score of 0.715 on the Breast MRI-NACT-Pilot dataset and a C-index of 0.807 and Dice score of 0.791 on the ISPY1 dataset- surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods.

The objective is to exploit the advantages of unsupervised clustering and supervised classification techniques to enhance the accuracy and robustness of classification models. The dataset underwent preprocessing procedures encompassing the handling of missing values, feature normalization, and feature selection. Missing values were addressed through appropriate methods, and features were scaled and selected based on variance threshold or correlation analysis. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was applied to the preprocessed data to assign cluster labels to each sample. The study then proceeded to train a Random Forest classifier by incorporating both the cluster labels and the raw gene eigenvalues as mixed features. This integration of gene expression values and cluster labels provides supplementary information to the classifier, enabling the capture of more intricate patterns within the data. The Random Forest classifier was trained using optimized parameters determined through parameter tuning, including the number of trees, maximum depth, and minimum number of split samples. Extensive experiments and evaluations conducted in this study revealed that the hybrid model outperformed the standalone Random Forest classification. The incorporation of K-Means clustering facilitated the discovery of underlying data structures and patterns, ultimately enhancing the classifier's discriminatory ability. The hybrid model exhibited superior accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, demonstrating its efficacy in accurately classifying breast cancer samples."

Zhe Lin,Breast cancer classification based on hybrid machine learning model,Automatic breast tumor segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is significant for the diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancers. CNNs have become an important method for early diagnosis of breast cancer and- thus- can help decrease the mortality rate. In order to assist medical professionals in breast cancer investigation a computerized system based on two encoder-decoder architectures for breast tumor segmentation has been developed. Two pre-trained DeepLabV3+ and U-Net models are proposed. The encoder generates a high-dimensional feature vector while the decoder analyses the low-resolution feature vector provided by the encoder and generates a semantic segmentation mask. Semantic segmentation based on deep learning techniques can overcome the limitations of traditional algorithms. To assess the efficiency of breast ultrasound image segmentation- we compare the segmentation results provided by CNNs against the Local Graph Cut technique (a semi-automatic segmentation method) in the Image Segmenter application. The output segmentation results have been evaluated by using the Dice similarity coefficient that compares the ground truth images provided by the specialists against the predicted segmentation results provided by the CNNs and Local Graph Cut algorithm. The proposed approach is validated on 780 breast ultrasonographic images of the BUSI public database of which 437 are benign and 210 are malignant. The BUSI database provides classification (benign or malignant) labels for ground truth in binary mask images. The average Dice scores computed between the ground truth images against CNNs were as follows: 0.9360 (malignant) and 0.9325 (benign) for the DeepLabV3+ architecture and of 0.6251 (malignant) and 0.6252 (benign) for the U-Net- respectively. When the segmentation results provided by CNNs were compared with the Local Graph Cut segmented images- the Dice scores were 0.9377 (malignant) and 0.9204 (benign) for DeepLabV3+ architecture and 0.6115 (malignant) and 0.6119 (benign) for U-Net- respectively. The results show that the DeepLabV3+ has significantly better segmentation performance and outperforms the U-Net network.
Jiayu Zhu,Breast cancer prediction based on the machine learning algorithm LightGBM,Breast cancer (BC) is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women- primarily due to metastases to other organs rather than the primary tumor. In this study- a comprehensive analysis of plasma proteomics and metabolomics was conducted on a cohort of 51 BC patients. Potential biomarkers were screened by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression and Random Forest algorithm. Additionally- enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits and untargeted metabolomics were utilized to validate the prognostic biomarkers in an independent cohort. In the study- extracellular matrix (ECM)-related functional enrichments were observed to be enriched in BC cases with bone metastases. Proteins dysregulated in retinol metabolism in liver metastases and leukocyte transendothelial migration in lung metastases were also identified. Machine learning models identified specific biomarker panels for each metastasis type- achieving high diagnostic accuracy with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.955 for bone- 0.941 for liver- and 0.989 for lung metastases. For bone metastasis- biomarkers such as leucyl-tryptophan- LysoPC(P-16:0/0:0)- FN1- and HSPG2 have been validated. dUDP- LPE(18:1/0:0)- and aspartylphenylalanine have been confirmed for liver metastasis. For lung metastasis- dUDP- testosterone sulfate- and PE(14:0/20:5) have been established.

Baranidharan B- Sistu Alekhya- Vedant Tiwari,Breast Cancer Determination Using B-Mode Ultrasound Imaging Using Deep Learning Technique,Background: Nottingham histological grade (NHG) is a well established prognostic factor in breast cancer histopathology but has a high inter-assessor variability with many tumours being classified as intermediate grade- NHG2. Here- we evaluate if DeepGrade- a previously developed model for risk stratification of resected tumour specimens- could be applied to risk-stratify tumour biopsy specimens. Methods: A total of 11-955-755 tiles from 1169 whole slide images of preoperative biopsies from 896 patients diagnosed with breast cancer in Stockholm- Sweden- were included. DeepGrade- a deep convolutional neural network model- was applied for the prediction of low- and high-risk tumours. It was evaluated against clinically assigned grades NHG1 and NHG3 on the biopsy specimen but also against the grades assigned to the corresponding resection specimen using area under the operating curve (AUC). The prognostic value of the DeepGrade model in the biopsy setting was evaluated using time-to-event analysis. Results: Based on preoperative biopsy images- the DeepGrade model predicted resected tumour cases of clinical grades NHG1 and NHG3 with an AUC of 0.908 (95% CI: 0.88; 0.93). Furthermore- out of the 432 resected clinically-assigned NHG2 tumours- 281 (65%) were classified as DeepGrade-low and 151 (35%) as DeepGrade-high. Using a multivariable Cox proportional hazards model the hazard ratio between DeepGrade low- and high-risk groups was estimated as 2.01 (95% CI: 1.06; 3.79). Conclusions: DeepGrade provided prediction of tumour grades NHG1 and NHG3 on the resection specimen using only the biopsy specimen. The results demonstrate that the DeepGrade model can provide decision support to identify high-risk tumours based on preoperative biopsies- thus improving early treatment decisions.

We aimed to develop a machine learning model utilizing optimal volumes of interest extracted from multisequence magnetic resonance images to predict lymphovascular invasion in patients with invasive breast cancer. This study comprised 191 patients postoperatively diagnosed with invasive breast cancer through multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging. Independent predictors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses- culminating in the construction of a clinical model. Radiomic features were extracted from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging images across various volume of interest scales (-2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- entire- +2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- +4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- and +6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm). Subsequently- various radiomic models were developed using machine learning model algorithms- including logistic regression- support vector machine- k-nearest neighbor- gradient boosting machine- classification and regression tree- and random forest. A hybrid model was then formulated- amalgamating optimal radiomic and clinical models. The area under the curve of the clinical model was 0.757. Among the radiomic models- the most efficient diagnosis was achieved by the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780. The hybrid model- integrating the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- and the clinical model surpassed the individual clinical and radiomics models- exhibiting a superior area under the curve of 0.864. Utilizing a hybrid approach integrating clinical data and multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics models based on the multiscale tumor region volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm) proved effective in determining lymphovascular invasion status in patients with invasive breast cancer. This innovative methodology may offer valuable insights for treatment planning and disease management.

Rajon Dash- Md Saidur Rahman Kohinoor- Promise Ghosh Chowdhury,Comprehensive Analysis of Machine and Deep Learning Models for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Risk Assessment with Diverse Datasets,Background: Accurate detection of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases in breast cancer is crucial for clinical staging and treatment planning. This study aims to develop a deep learning model using clinical implication-applied preprocessed computed tomography (CT) images to enhance the prediction of ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients. Methods: A total of 1128 axial CT images of ALN (538 malignant and 590 benign lymph nodes) were collected from 523 breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative CT scans between January 2012 and July 2022 at Hallym University Medical Center. To develop an optimal deep learning model for distinguishing metastatic ALN from benign ALN- a CT image preprocessing protocol with clinical implications and two different cropping methods (fixed size crop [FSC] method and adjustable square crop [ASC] method) were employed. The images were analyzed using three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (ResNet- DenseNet- and EfficientNet). Ensemble methods involving and combining the selection of the two best-performing CNN architectures from each cropping method were applied to generate the final result. Results: For the two different cropping methods- DenseNet consistently outperformed ResNet and EfficientNet. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for DenseNet- using the FSC and ASC methods- was 0.934 and 0.939- respectively. The ensemble model- which combines the performance of the DenseNet121 architecture for both cropping methods- delivered outstanding results with an AUROC of 0.968- an accuracy of 0.938- a sensitivity of 0.980- and a specificity of 0.903. Furthermore- distinct trends observed in gradient-weighted class activation mapping images with the two cropping methods suggest that our deep learning model not only evaluates the lymph node itself- but also distinguishes subtler changes in lymph node margin and adjacent soft tissue- which often elude human interpretation. Conclusions: This research demonstrates the promising performance of a deep learning model in accurately detecting malignant ALNs in breast cancer patients using CT images. The integration of clinical considerations into image processing and the utilization of ensemble methods further improved diagnostic precision.

Fares Mohammad- Bader Al-Haran- Iyad Abu Doush- Marwa Kandil,Evaluation of Machine-Learning Based Approaches for Early Detection of Breast Cancer Tumor,Cancer-related deadly diseases affect both developed and underdeveloped nations worldwide. Effective network learning is crucial to more reliably identify and categorize breast carcinoma in vast and unbalanced image datasets. The absence of early cancer symptoms makes the early identification process challenging. Therefore- from the perspectives of diagnosis- prevention- and therapy- cancer continues to be among the healthcare concerns that numerous researchers work to advance. It is highly essential to design an innovative breast cancer detection model by considering the complications presented in the classical techniques. Initially- breast cancer images are gathered from online sources and it is further subjected to the segmentation region. Here- it is segmented using Adaptive Trans-Dense-Unet (A-TDUNet)- and their parameters are tuned using the developed Modified Sheep Flock Optimization Algorithm (MSFOA). The segmented images are further subjected to the breast cancer detection stage and effective breast cancer detection is performed by Multiscale Dilated Densenet with Attention Mechanism (MDD-AM). Throughout the result validation- the Net Present Value (NPV) and accuracy rate of the designed approach are 96.719% and 93.494%. Hence- the implemented breast cancer detection model secured a better efficacy rate than the baseline detection methods in diverse experimental conditions.

Daniel Addo- Mugahed A. Al-Antari- Shijie Zhou- Eric Ashalley- Gladys Wavinya Muoka- Obed T. Nartey,FoSoHA-Net: Deep Learning for Accurate Breast Cancer Classification Leveraging Hybrid Attention Mechanisms,Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have prognostic significance in several cancers- including breast cancer. Despite interest in combining radiation therapy with immunotherapy- little is known about the effect of radiation therapy itself on the tumor-immune microenvironment- including TILs. Here- we interrogated longitudinal dynamics of TILs and systemic lymphocytes in patient samples taken before- during- and after neoadjuvant radiation therapy (NART) from PRADA and Neo-RT breast clinical trials. We manually scored stromal TILs (sTILs) from longitudinal tumor samples using standardized guidelines as well as deep learning-based scores at cell-level (cTIL) and cell- and tissue-level combination analyses (SuperTIL). In parallel- we interrogated absolute lymphocyte counts from routine blood tests at corresponding time points during treatment. Exploratory analyses studied the relationship between TILs and pathologic complete response (pCR) and long-term outcomes. Patients receiving NART experienced a significant and uniform decrease in sTILs that did not recover at the time of surgery (P < .0001). This lymphodepletive effect was also mirrored in peripheral blood. Our SuperTIL deep learning score showed good concordance with manual sTILs and importantly performed comparably to manual scores in predicting pCR from diagnostic biopsies. The analysis suggested an association between baseline sTILs and pCR- as well as sTILs at surgery and relapse- in patients receiving NART. This study provides novel insights into TIL dynamics in the context of NART in breast cancer and demonstrates the potential for artificial intelligence to assist routine pathology. We have identified trends that warrant further interrogation and have a bearing on future radioimmunotherapy trials.

John Justin Thangaraj,Progressing Breast Cancer Assessment: Precise Tumor Categorization through DenseNet201-based Deep Learning,<title>Abstract</title> <p>Background Delays in seeking medical care may affect the survival rates of breast cancer patients. We aimed to explore potential risk factors for the delay in seeking medical care among breast cancer patients by constructing a highly effective machine learning (ML) prediction model. Methods A cross-sectional methodology was utilized- and the demographic and clinical characteristics of 540 patients with breast cancer in Sichuan Cancer Hospital from July 2022 to June 2023 were collected to develop a model. Feature selection was performed using a Lasso algorithm- and six ML algorithms- including XGB- LR- RF- CNB- SVM and KNN- were applied for model construction. The k-fold cross-validation method was used for internal verification. And ROC curves- calibration curves- DCA and external validation were used for model evaluation. The SHAP method was used to interpret the model visualization. Results A comprehensive analysis was conducted in a cohort of 540 patients diagnosed with breast cancer- of whom 212 patients (39.26%) experienced a delay. Lasso algorithm selected eight variables that were most suitable for model construction. The RF model demonstrated superior performance compared to the other five prediction models. The AUC values in the training set ROC- validation set ROC- and external verification ROC curves were 1.00- 0.86- and 0.76- respectively in RF model. The results of the calibration curves indicated that the calibration curves of the RF models closely resembled the ideal curves. The DCA curves exhibited a net clinical benefit in comparison to treatment for or treatment for none for all models- with the exception of CNB. Conclusions The machine learning algorithm utilized in this study effectively generated a prediction model for delays in seeking medical care for patients with breast cancer. The best RF model's remarkable predictive power- exhibiting a good discrimination and calibration.</p>

Healthcare professionals rely on analyzing patients' clinical characteristics and findings to determine treatment plans- making accurate predictions essential for efficient resource utilization and optimal patient support during recovery. In this study- a hybrid architecture combining Stacked AutoEncoders- Particle Swarm Optimization- and the Softmax Classifier was developed for predicting patient survival. The architecture was evaluated using the Haberman's Survival dataset and the Echocardiogram dataset from UCI. The results were compared with several Machine Learning methods- including Decision Trees- K-Nearest Neighbors- Support Vector Machines- Neural Networks- Gradient Boosting- and Gradient Bagging applied to the same datasets. The findings indicate that the proposed architecture outperforms other Machine Learning methods in predicting patient survival for both datasets and surpasses the results reported in the literature for the Haberman's Survival dataset. In the light of the findings obtained- the models obtained with the proposed architecture can be used as a decision support system in determining patient care and applied methods.

Data from a prospective cohort comprising 85-504 women enrolled in the National Urban Cancer Screening Program in Beijing (2013-2019) and the Tracking Air Pollution in China dataset are used. Monthly exposures were aggregated to calculate 5-year average concentrations to indicate long-term exposure. Cox models and mixture exposure models (weighted quantile sum- quantile-based g-computation- and explanatory machine learning model) were employed to analyze the associations. Findings indicated increased levels of PM2.5 and its constituents were associated with higher breast cancer risk- with hazard ratios per 1-â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´g/m3 increase of 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.01- 1.03)- 1.39 (95% CI: 1.16- 1.65)- 1.28 (95% CI: 1.12- 1.46)- 1.15 (95% CI: 1.05- 1.24)- 1.05 (95% CI: 1.02- 1.08)- and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.07- 1.23) for PM2.5- BC- NH4+- NO3-- OM- and SO42-- respectively. Exposure-response curves demonstrated a monotonic risk increase without an evident threshold. Mixture exposure models highlighted BC and SO42- as key factors- underscoring the importance of reducing emissions of these pollutants.

Several deep learning approaches were investigated including ViT transformer and VGG16- VGG19- ResNet-50- Res-Net-101- Res-Net-152- InceptionV3 and Xception transfer learning networks. These deep learning networks were applied on CT images to assess the response to NAC. Performance was evaluated based on balanced_accuracy- accuracy- sensitivity and specificity classification metrics. A ViT transformer was applied to utilize the attention mechanism in order to increase the weight of important part image which leads to better discrimination between classes. Amongst the 117 LABC patients studied- 82 (70%) had clinical-pathological response and 35 (30%) had no response to NAC. The ViT transformer obtained the best performance range (accuracy = 71 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 3% to accuracy = 77 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4%- specificity = 86 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 6% to specificity = 76 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 3%- sensitivity = 56 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4% to sensitivity = 52 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4%- and balanced_accuracy=69 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 3% to balanced_accuracy=69 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 3%) depending on the split ratio of train-data and test-data. Xception network obtained the second best results (accuracy = 72 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4% to accuracy = 65 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4- specificity = 81 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 6% to specificity = 73 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 3%- sensitivity = 55 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4% to sensitivity = 52 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 5%- and balanced_accuracy = 66 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 5% to balanced_accuracy = 60 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 4%). The worst results were obtained using VGG-16 transfer learning network. Deep learning networks in conjunction with CT imaging are able to predict the tumor response to NAC for patients with LABC prior to start. A ViT transformer could obtain the best performance- which demonstrated the importance of attention mechanism.

A Alali- N Hewahi,Generating MRI Images Based on Clinical Text Using Diffusion Models for Breast Cancer,Radiation induced acute skin toxicity (AST) is considered as a common side effect of breast radiation therapy. The goal of this study was to design dosiomics-based machine learning (ML) models for prediction of AST- to enable creating optimized treatment plans for high-risk individuals. Dosiomics features extracted using Pyradiomics tool (v3.0.1)- along with treatment plan-derived dose volume histograms (DVHs)- and patient-specific treatment-related (PTR) data of breast cancer patients were used for modeling. Clinical scoring was done using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V4.0 criteria for skin-specific symptoms.

They were randomly divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) cohorts. Multiple prediction models were assessed through multivariate analysis- incorporating different combinations of feature groups (dosiomics- DVH- and PTR) individually and collectively. In total- seven unique combinations- along with seven classification algorithms- were considered after feature selection. The performance of each model was evaluated on the test group using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and f1-score. Accuracy- precision- and recall of each model were also studied. Statistical analysis involved features differences between AST 2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ - and ASTÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢groups and cutoff value calculations.

Tukaram Navghare- Aniket Muley- Vinayak Jadhav,Classification of Breast Cancer Patients using Deep Learning Techniques,We aimed to construct an expert knowledge-based Bayesian network (BN) model for assessing the overall disease burden (ODB) in (y)pN1 breast cancer patients and compare ODB across arms of ongoing trials. Utilizing institutional data and expert surveys- we developed a BN model for (y)pN1 breast cancer. Expert-derived probabilities and disability weights for radiotherapy-related benefit (e.g.- 7-year disease-free survival [DFS]) and toxicities were integrated into the model. ODB was defined as the sum of disability weights multiplied by probabilities. In silico predictions were conducted for Alliance A011202- PORT-N1- RAPCHEM- and RT-CHARM trials- comparing ODB- 7-year DFS- and side effects. In the Alliance A011202 trial- 7-year DFS was 80.1% in both arms. Axillary lymph node dissection led to higher clinical lymphedema and ODB compared to sentinel lymph node biopsy with full regional nodal irradiation (RNI). In the PORT-N1 trial- the control arm (whole-breast irradiation [WBI] with RNI or post-mastectomy radiotherapy [PMRT]) had an ODB of 0.254- while the experimental arm (WBI alone or no PMRT) had an ODB of 0.255. In the RAPCHEM trial- the radiotherapy field did not impact the 7-year DFS in ypN1 patients. However- there was a mild ODB increase with a larger irradiation field. In the RT-CHARM trial- we identified factors associated with the major complication rate- which ranged from 18.3% to 22.1%. The expert knowledge-based BN model predicted ongoing trial outcomes- validating reported results and assumptions. In addition- the model demonstrated the ODB in different arms- with an emphasis on quality of life.
Gitanjali Pradhani- Jonali Gogoi,Unveiling Key Gene Biomarkers and Clinical Factors in Breast Cancer Subtypes Using Machine Learning and Cox Regression,To explore whether the combination of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and nonmono-exponential (NME) model-based diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) via deep neural network (DNN) can improve the prediction of breast cancer molecular subtypes compared to either imaging technique used alone. This prospective study examined 480 breast cancers in 475 patients undergoing DCE-MRI and NME-DWI at 3.0 T. Breast cancers were classified as follows: human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 enriched (HER2-enriched)- luminal A- luminal B (HER2-)- luminal B (HER2+)- and triple-negative subtypes. A total of 20% cases were withheld as an independent test dataset- and the remaining cases were used to train DNN with an 80% to 20% training-validation split and 5-fold cross-validation. The diagnostic accuracies of DNN in 5-way subtype classification between the DCE-MRI- NME-DWI- and their combined multiparametric-MRI datasets were compared using analysis of variance with least significant difference posthoc test. Areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curves were calculated to assess the performances of DNN in binary subtype classification between the 3 datasets. The 5-way classification accuracies of DNN on both DCE-MRI (0.71) and NME-DWI (0.64) were significantly lower (P < .05) than on multiparametric-MRI (0.76)- while on DCE-MRI was significantly higher (P < .05) than on NME-DWI. The comparative results of binary classification between the 3 datasets were consistent with the 5-way classification. The combination of DCE-MRI and NME-DWI via DNN achieved a significant improvement in breast cancer molecular subtype prediction compared to either imaging technique used alone. Additionally- DCE-MRI outperformed NME-DWI in differentiating subtypes.
Yan Jiang- Yuanyuan Peng- Yingyi Wu- Qing Sun- Tebo Hua,Multimodal Machine Learning-Based Ductal Carcinoma in situ Prediction from Breast Fibromatosis,<p>The utilization of mammography images plays a vital role in the prompt detection and treatment of breast cancer. Breast imaging techniques aid medical professionals in assessing the dimensions- morphology- and spatial orientation of breast lesions- facilitating the differentiation between benign and malignant conditions. Breast tissue can vary widely in terms of density- composition- and structure- leading to complexities in distinguishing between benign and malignant conditions. The primary contribution of this paper is the proposal of a spatial attention-based neural architecture search network (SANAS-Net) technique that incorporates a spatial attention mechanism- enabling the model to learn and prioritize key regions within mammograms (MMs). Multi-head attention is employed within the transformer blocks to effectively capture a wide range of spatial relations and feature interactions. Global contextual information was integrated into the transformer blocks by means of introducing positional embeddings. Several practical studies have been undertaken to verify the effectiveness of our methodology in identifying fully attentive networks that exhibit good performance in distinguishing between malignant and benign breast cancer cases. The experimental study reached a test accuracy of 89.95%- which is way higher than previously proposed algorithms for mammography imagebased breast cancer detection.</p>
Velayutham Pavanasam,Advanced Machine Learning Techniques for Early Breast Cancer Detection through DNA Methylation Analysis,Patients with cancer often undergo multiple extended treatments that decrease their quality of life. However- the quality of life of women with breast cancer after they undergo treatment remains underexplored in Brazil. Therefore- this study determined sociodemographic- behavioral- and clinical factors related to the post-treatment quality of life of women with breast cancer. This cross-sectional study involved 101 women diagnosed with breast cancer between 2014 and 2016 and treated at a Brazilian Oncology Reference Service. Data were collected from them using face-to-face surveys. Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) and EORTC Breast Cancer-specific Quality of Life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-BR23). The data collected were analyzed using Student's t-test and Mann-Whitney U test. The median score on the global health- functional- and symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-C30 was 75.00 (Interquartile range=33.33)- 75.99 (Standard deviation [SD]=19.26)- and 19.67 (SD=16.91)- respectively. The mean score on the functional and symptom scales of the EORTC QLQ-BR23 was 61.89 (SD=17.21) and 20.12 (SD=16.94)- respectively. Furthermore- higher post-treatment quality of life was found to be associated with being aged 50 or more- being Black- having eight or more years of education- having a partner- having a paying job- receiving treatment from the private healthcare system- having a higher income- living in the municipality where healthcare services are availed- engaging in physical activity- not smoking- being more religious- having more social support- not being overweight- having no comorbidities- and undergoing lumpectomy. Sociodemographic- behavioral- and clinical factors significantly impact the quality of life of women who undergo breast cancer treatment. Implementing interventions that improve health and reducing inequalities in the access to healthcare services can improve the quality of life of these patients. Sociodemographic- clinical- and lifestyle factors impact the quality of life of breast cancer survivors. Breast cancer therapy may affect future perspectives and emotional- cognitive- and sexual function. Some aspects of quality of life still require attention from health professionals. Higher post-treatment quality of life of women with breast cancer is linked to being aged 50 or more- being Black- having 8 or more years of education- having a partner- having a paying job- receiving care from private healthcare- having a high per capita income- residing in the municipality where the service is availed- engaging in physical activity- not smoking- greater religiosity- having more social support- having a normal weight- having no comorbidities- and undergoing lumpectomy.

Melwin D'souza- Ananth Prabhu Gurpur- Varuna Kumara,SANAS-Net: spatial attention neural architecture search for breast cancer detection,Extensive exploration of the molecular subtypes of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is critical for advancing precision medicine. Notably- the luminal androgen receptor (LAR) subtype has attracted attention for targeted treatment combining androgen receptor antagonists and CDK4/6 inhibitors. Unfortunately- this strategy has proven to be of limited efficacy- highlighting the need for further optimization. Using our center's comprehensive multiomics dataset (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢465)- we identified novel therapeutic targets and evaluated their efficacy through multiple models- including in vitro LAR cell lines- in vivo cell-derived allograft models and ex vivo patient-derived organoids. Moreover- we conducted flow cytometry and RNA-seq analysis to unveil potential mechanisms underlying the regulation of tumor progression by these therapeutic strategies. LAR breast cancer cells exhibited sensitivity to chidamide and enzalutamide individually- with a drug combination assay revealing their synergistic effect. Crucially- this synergistic effect was verified through in vivo allograft models and patient-derived organoids. Furthermore- transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the combination therapeutic strategy could inhibit tumor progression by regulating metabolism and autophagy. This study confirmed that the combination of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors and androgen receptor (AR) antagonists possessed greater therapeutic efficacy than monotherapy in LAR TNBC. This finding significantly bolsters the theoretical basis for the clinical translation of this combination therapy and provides an innovative strategy for the targeted treatment of LAR TNBC.

Atefeh Azin Kousha- Jingxin Zhang,GCN Based Deep Learning for Effective Classification of Breast Cancer Estrogen Receptor Status Using a Single Image from TMA,Breast cancer affects one in eight women during their lifetime; it may coincide with other diseases due to its high prevalence. Different pathologies that occur simultaneously with breast cancer- or later during its course- lead to multiple interactions with cancer and have a significant impact on its management. A 58-year-old Syrian female was admitted to our hospital for compliant of abdominal distension. Following complete examination- obtained biopsies confirmed the diagnosis of peritoneal tuberculosis. At a subsequent time- she suffered back pain and the computed tomography showed vertebral lesion with breast mass that was diagnosed as invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) of the left breast. Vertebral lesion that appeared on radiologic assessment was diagnosed as cancer metastasis. However- the interaction of this metastasis with the proposed management diverted the attention towards its non-cancerous entity. Five months after completing the chemotherapy- biopsies revealed the recurrence of triple-negative (ER-- PR-- HER2- neu-) ILC of the breast. Ultimately- the patient was followed up for an overall duration of 4 years. Latent tuberculosis infections may be activated by chemotherapy regimens that suppress immunity. Therefore- initial management of tuberculous infection is preferred when it coexists with cancer. Breast cancer is common and may co-present with other diseases- which- in some cases- produce mimicking lesions that alter its diagnosis. Pott's disease- albeit a rare entity- has shown a resurgence in developed countries and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of vertebral lesions in patients with breast cancer.

Sanitha P S -- Jayakrishnan B -,Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis Using Triple Hybrid Deep Learning Approach,Assistive medical image classifiers can greatly reduce the workload of medical personnel. However- traditional machine learning methods require large amounts of well-labeled data and long learning times to solve medical image classification problems- which can lead to high training costs and poor applicability. To address this problem- a novel unsupervised breast cancer image classification model based on multiscale texture analysis and a dynamic learning strategy for mammograms is proposed in this paper. First- a gray-level cooccurrence matrix and Tamura coarseness are used to transfer images to multiscale texture feature vectors. Then- an unsupervised dynamic learning mechanism is used to classify these vectors. In the simulation experiments with a resolution of 40 pixels- the accuracy- precision- F1-score and AUC of the proposed method reach 91.500%- 92.780%- 91.370%- and 91.500%- respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide an effective reference for breast cancer diagnosis.

Nazia Nuzhat- Faisal Islam- Abu Sayed Sikder- Narayan Ranjan Chakraborty,Comparative Performance Analysis of Ensemble Models for Breast Cancer Classification,Among the analytes circulating in body fluids- microRNAs- a type of non-coding RNA and known to exist 2655 in primates- have attracted attention as a novel biomarker for cancer screening. MicroRNAs are signaling molecules with important gene expression regulatory functions that can simultaneously control many gene functions and multiple different pathways in living organisms. These microRNAs are transported in extracellular vesicles (EVs)- which are lipid bilayers with 50-150 nm in diameter- and are used as communication tools between cells. Furthermore- the EVs that carry these microRNAs circulate in the bloodstream and have other important implications for understanding the pathogenesis and diagnosis of breast cancer. The greatest benefit from cancer screening is the reduction in breast cancer mortality rate through early detection. Other benefits include reduced incidence of breast cancer- improved quality of life- prognosis prediction- contribution to personalized medicine- and relative healthcare cost containment. This paper outlines the latest developments in liquid biopsy for breast cancer- especially focusing on microRNA and EV diagnostics.
Prithwish Ghosh- Debolina Banerjee,Optimizing Breast Cancer Classification: A Comparative Analysis of Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Techniques,Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low status has recently gained attention because of the potential therapeutic benefits of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) in breast cancer patients. We aimed to investigate the concordance of HER2 status between core needle biopsy (CNB) and subsequent surgical resection specimens focusing on the HER2-low status. This retrospective study was conducted in 1-387 patients with invasive breast cancer whose HER2 status was evaluated in both CNB and surgical resection specimens. The discordance rates between CNB and surgical resection specimens and the clinicopathological features associated with HER2 status discordance were analyzed. The overall concordance rates of HER2 status between CNB and surgical resection specimens were 99.0% (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ Â¬Â¥â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.925) for two-group classification (negative vs. positive) and 78.5% (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ Â¬Â¥â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.587) for three-group classification (zero vs. low vs. positive). The largest discordance occurred in CNB-HER2-zero cases with 42.8% of them reclassified as HER2-low in surgical resection. HER2 discordance was associated with lower histologic grade- tumor multiplicity- and luminal A subtype. In multivariate analysis- tumor multiplicity and estrogen receptor (ER) positivity were independent predictive factors for HER2-zero to low conversion. Incorporation of HER2-low category in HER2 status interpretation reduces the concordance rate between CNB and surgical resection specimens. Tumor multiplicity and ER positivity are predictive factors for conversion from HER2-zero to HER2-low status. Therefore- HER2 status should be re-evaluated in resection specimens when considering ADCs in tumors exhibiting multiplicity and ER positivity.

Jagrati Mathpal,Breast Cancer Detection: A Comprehensive Study on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques,Breast Cancer (BC) is a major universal health problem. Early detection and precise diagnosis are vital for enlightening outcomes. Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies can potentially revolutionize the field of BC by providing quantitative representations of medical images to assist in segmentation- diagnosis- and prognosis. AI can improve image quality- detect and segment breast lesions- classify cancer and predict its behavior- and integrate data from multiple sources to predict clinical outcomes. It can lead to more personalized and effective treatment for BC patients. Challenges faced by AI in real-life solicitations include data curation- model interpretability- and run-through guidelines. However- the clinical implementation of AI is expected to deliver vital guidance for patient-tailored management. BC is a major global health problem; early detection and treatment are crucial for improving outcomes. Imaging detection is a key screening- diagnosis- and treatment effectiveness assessment tool. However- the irresistible number of images creates a heavy capacity for radiologists and delays reporting. AI has the potential to revolutionize BC imaging by improving efficiency and accuracy. AI can recognize- segment- and diagnose tumor lesions automatically and analyze tumor images on a molecular level. It could lead to more personalized treatment strategies. However- AI-assisted imaging diagnosis is still in its early stages of development- and more research is needed to validate its clinical effectiveness. Therefore- AI is a promising new technology that has the potential to progress the diagnosis and treatment of BC- and AI-assisted imaging diagnosis is a promising new technology for improving the early detection and diagnosis of BC. More research is needed to bring this technology to clinical practice.

One of the newest fields in today's diagnostic system is digital pathology. The first crucial step before cancer classification is image segmentation. The fundamental problem occurs when there are nuclei for separation that are touching or overlapping. In this paper- an image segmentation approach is presented using the thresholding methodology. The morphological processes and binarization that follow OTSU thresholding are used in the proposed technique. The undesirable areas of the photograph are deleted during post-processing. The experimental results on the used datasets support the suggested strategy's effectiveness. The dataset will be examined as part of our second goal- which is to evaluate how well machine learning techniques may then be used to predict breast cancer. Here- Support Vector Machine is utilised for categorization malignant and benign cancer.

We examine various training strategies and configurations- including pretraining- dimension resizing- data augmentation and color normalization strategies- patch overlap- and patch size configurations- in order to evaluate their impact on the effectiveness of the histology image classification. Additionally- we provide evidence for the increase in effectiveness gathered through geometric and color data augmentation techniques. We primarily utilize the BACH dataset to train and validate our methods and models- but we also test them on two additional datasets- BRACS and AIDPATH- to verify their generalization capabilities. Our model- developed from a transformer pretrained on ImageNet- achieves an accuracy rate of 0.91 on the BACH dataset- 0.74 on the BRACS dataset- and 0.92 on the AIDPATH dataset. Using a model based on the prostate small and prostate medium HistoEncoder models- we achieve accuracy rates of 0.89 and 0.86- respectively. Our results suggest that pretraining on large-scale general datasets like ImageNet is advantageous. We also show the potential benefits of using domain-specific pretraining datasets- such as extensive histopathological image collections as in HistoEncoder- though not yet with clear advantages.
ZU Rehman- MF Ahmad Fauzi- WSHM Wan Ahmad- ...,Deep-Learning-Based Approach in Cancer-Region Assessment from HER2-SISH Breast Histopathology Whole Slide Images,Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer in women. Risk factor assessment can aid in directing counseling regarding risk reduction and breast cancer surveillance. This research aims to (1) investigate the relationship between various risk factors and breast cancer incidence using the BCSC (Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium) Risk Factor Dataset and create a prediction model for assessing the risk of developing breast cancer; (2) diagnose breast cancer using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset; and (3) analyze breast cancer survivability using the SEER (Surveillance- Epidemiology- and End Results) Breast Cancer Dataset. Applying resampling techniques on the training dataset before using various machine learning techniques can affect the performance of the classifiers. The three breast cancer datasets were examined using a variety of pre-processing approaches and classification models to assess their performance in terms of accuracy- precision- F-1 scores- etc. The PCA (principal component analysis) and resampling strategies produced remarkable results. For the BCSC Dataset- the Random Forest algorithm exhibited the best performance out of the applied classifiers- with an accuracy of 87.53%. Out of the different resampling techniques applied to the training dataset for training the Random Forest classifier- the Tomek Link exhibited the best test accuracy- at 87.47%. We compared all the models used with previously used techniques. After applying the resampling techniques- the accuracy scores of the test data decreased even if the training data accuracy increased. For the Breast Cancer Wisconsin diagnostic dataset- the K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm had the best accuracy with the original dataset test set- at 94.71%- and the PCA dataset test set exhibited 95.29% accuracy for detecting breast cancer. Using the SEER Dataset- this study also explores survival analysis- employing supervised and unsupervised learning approaches to offer insights into the variables affecting breast cancer survivability. This study emphasizes the significance of individualized approaches in the management and treatment of breast cancer by incorporating phenotypic variations and recognizing the heterogeneity of the disease. Through data-driven insights and advanced machine learning- this study contributes significantly to the ongoing efforts in breast cancer research- diagnostics- and personalized medicine.

A Bilal- A Imran- TI Baig- X Liu- E Abouel Nasr- ...,Breast cancer diagnosis using support vector machine optimized by improved quantum inspired grey wolf optimization,An intraoperative diagnosis is critical for precise cancer surgery. However- traditional intraoperative assessments based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) histology- such as frozen section- are time-- resource-- and labor-intensive- and involve specimen-consuming concerns. Here- we report a near-real-time automated cancer diagnosis workflow for breast cancer that combines dynamic full-field optical coherence tomography (D-FFOCT)- a label-free optical imaging method- and deep learning for bedside tumor diagnosis during surgery. To classify the benign and malignant breast tissues- we conducted a prospective cohort trial. In the modeling group (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 182)- D-FFOCT images were captured from April 26 to June 20- 2018- encompassing 48 benign lesions- 114 invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC)- 10 invasive lobular carcinoma- 4 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)- and 6 rare tumors. Deep learning model was built up and fine-tuned in 10-357 D-FFOCT patches. Subsequently- from June 22 to August 17- 2018- independent tests (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 42) were conducted on 10 benign lesions- 29 IDC- 1 DCIS- and 2 rare tumors. The model yielded excellent performance- with an accuracy of 97.62%- sensitivity of 96.88% and specificity of 100%; only one IDC was misclassified. Meanwhile- the acquisition of the D-FFOCT images was non-destructive and did not require any tissue preparation or staining procedures. In the simulated intraoperative margin evaluation procedure- the time required for our novel workflow (approximately 3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ min) was significantly shorter than that required for traditional procedures (approximately 30Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ min). These findings indicate that the combination of D-FFOCT and deep learning algorithms can streamline intraoperative cancer diagnosis independently of traditional pathology laboratory procedures.

Erin J. Kim- Enoch Chung- Bernard T. Lee- Dhruv Singhal,D134. Application of Machine Learning to Predict Breast Cancer Related-lymphedema Development,Introduction: When considering cancer mortality rates in general- Breast Cancer (BC) is a major contributor among females. Patientsâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢ chances of survival increase when BC is detected early and treated with the appropriate treatment at the right time. There is strong evidence that mammography- when used as a screening tool- can detect BC at an early stage. Mammography is a diagnostic tool that uses low-dose X-rays to visualise the breast and evaluate its anatomy. For screening purposes- it is currently the preferred method. The present study employs deep learning models trained using Transfer Learning (TL) techniques. Aim: To automate the process of BC diagnosis in mammograms. The main goal of this approach is to simplify the process of early detection and diagnosis of BC for healthcare practitioners. Materials and Methods: The dataset obtained from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) was categorised into three distinct categories: benign- malignant and normal. The initial MIAS dataset underwent several preprocessing techniques- including noise reduction- breast image contrast enhancement- non breast region deletion and malignant lesion identification- before analysis. An intricately designed fully connected classifier complements pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures like ResNet50 and VGG16 in the proposed model. Results: The VGG16 model performed admirably- achieving an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.950 and an accuracy rate of 96.00%. In addition- it displayed an outstanding F-score of 97%- along with high sensitivity- specificity and accuracy. These outcomes are significantly better compared to the other methods. Conclusion: The modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s enhanced capabilities for early-stage cancer detection could improve patient outcomes and reduce mortality rates. Furthermore- new tools can ease the workload for radiologists- leading to more standardised and efficient diagnostic procedures.
D Furness,31 A Comparison of Deep Learning Artificial Intelligence Methods with Radiologists in Breast Cancer Screening for Guiding Patient Management,Numerous studies have been conducted using Deep Learning paradigms to detect Breast Cancer. Breast cancer is a medical condition where abnormal cells in the breast grow uncontrollably- forming tumors. If not treated- these tumors can metastasize and spread to other parts of the body- potentially leading to life-threatening consequences. In the year 2020- there were approximately 2.3 million cases of breast cancer diagnosed in women- leading to around 685-000 deaths worldwide. By the close of 2020- there existed 7.8 million women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer within the preceding five years- solidifying it as the most widespread form of cancer globally. Breast cancer is observed across all countries- affecting women at various ages post-puberty- with incidence rates tending to rise in older age groups. The aim of this paper is to classify and predict the class labels of breast cancer. To achieve this- a ResNet50 model is utilized and mammography images are employed to locate cancer within the image and classify it to emphasize the affected area. The ResNet50 identifies mass regions and classifies them as either ductal carcinoma- inflammatory- triple negative or invasive cancer. The experimentation is carried out on breast cancer dataset and achieved 90.6% accuracy both for classification as well as prediction
J Xie- J Wei- H Shi- Z Lin- J Lu- X Zhang- ...,A deep learning approach for early prediction of breast cancer neoadjuvant chemotherapy response on multistage bimodal ultrasound images,Background In recent years- computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have played an important role in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. The image segmentation task is the key step in a CAD system for the rapid identification of lesions. Therefore- an efficient breast image segmentation network is necessary for improving the diagnostic accuracy in breast cancer screening. However- due to the characteristics of blurred boundaries- low contrast- and speckle noise in breast ultrasound images- breast lesion segmentation is challenging. In addition- many of the proposed breast tumor segmentation networks are too complex to be applied in practice. Methods We developed the attention gate and dilation U-shaped network (GDUNet)- a lightweight- breast lesion segmentation model. This model improves the inverted bottleneck- integrating it with tokenized multilayer perceptron (MLP) to construct the encoder. Additionally- we introduce the lightweight attention gate (AG) within the skip connection- which effectively filters noise in low-level semantic information across spatial and channel dimensions- thus attenuating irrelevant features. To further improve performance- we innovated the AG dilation (AGDT) block and embedded it between the encoder and decoder in order to capture critical multiscale contextual information. Results We conducted experiments on two breast cancer datasets. The experimentâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s results show that compared to UNet- GDUNet could reduce the number of parameters by 10 times and the computational complexity by 58 times while providing a double of the inference speed. Moreover- the GDUNet achieved a better segmentation performance than did the state-of-the-art medical image segmentation architecture. Conclusions Our proposed GDUNet method can achieve advanced segmentation performance on different breast ultrasound image datasets with high efficiency.

,Predictive Modeling for Breast Cancer Prognosis: A Machine Learning Paradigm,Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women- and ultrasound serves as a critically important imaging technique for its detection and classification in dense breast tissues. Compared to individual static ultrasound images- ultrasound videos offer more comprehensive information for screening and diagnosis. Current deep learning-based methods for breast ultrasound video classification often rely on manually selected keyframes- i.e.- frames with stable and clear features key to image analysis tasks. However- the selection of these keyframes depends heavily on the experience of radiologists. In this paper- we propose a breast cancer video classification method that eliminates the need for manual selection of keyframes and reduces the reliance on radiologists' experience. Specifically- we introduce a Segment Attention Generator (SAG) module to guide deep learning models to pay more attention to video segments that exhibit stable and clear appearances for predicting classification. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method boosts the performance of classifying breast ultrasound videos. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed SAG module. Additionally- we introduce a new dataset for breast ultrasound video classification to address the current scarcity of publicly available datasets. Our dataset and code are openly accessible at https://github.com/imzhangyd/SAG-Net.

,Interpretable Deep Learning Model for Breast Cancer Risk Prediction,BACKGROUND Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become increasingly important for breast cancer survivors- but clinically relevant declines often persist for many years after treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether social relationships can mitigate or prevent this decline in HRQOL. METHODS Data were used from the German population-based Mamma Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation (MARIE) cohort of 2022 breast cancer cases with follow-up information for more than 15 years after diagnosis. Correlations between social integration- social support- and global health status (GHS) as an overall measure of HRQOL were analyzed- and linear regression analysis was performed with structural equation modeling. RESULTS The majority of participants reported high levels of social integration and social support and moderate levels of GHS. Social integration 5 years after diagnosis was associated with GHS 5 years after diagnosis (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 1.12; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.25-1.99)- but no longitudinal effects were found. Social support 5 years after diagnosis was associated with better GHS 5 years (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.42; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.36-0.48) and 10 years after diagnosis (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.12; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.02-0.22)- whereas social support 10 years after diagnosis was associated with GHS 10 years (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.29; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.20-0.39) and 15 years after diagnosis (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.10; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.01-0.21). CONCLUSIONS These results confirm that social relationships positively influence HRQOL in long-term breast cancer survivors and that their association should receive more attention clinically and beyond routine care.
Rufei Ma,Machine learning and nomogram novel prognostic models based on LODDS for elderly breast cancer,Complete removal of cancer tumors with a negative specimen margin during lumpectomy is essential to reduce breast cancer recurrence. However- 2D radiography- the current method used to assess intraoperative specimen margin status- has limited accuracy- resulting in nearly one in four patients needing repeat surgery. This study aims to develop a deep learning model that improves the detection of positive margins in intraoperative breast lumpectomy specimens on radiographs. We annotated the lumpectomy radiograph images with masking that denotes regions of known malignancy- non-malignant tissue- and the areas of pathology-confirmed positive margin. We propose a pretraining strategy- namely Forward-Forward Contrastive Learning (FFCL) with both local and global-level contrastive learning. Experimental results on our annotated breast radiographs demonstrate the effectiveness of our FFCL method in detecting positive margins from intraoperative radiographs of breast lumpectomy specimens.
Houmem Slimi- Sabeur Abid,Optimized Transfer Learning Models for Breast Cancer image classification,<title>Abstract</title> <p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical gene that serves as a receptor to transmit signals for aggressive cell division in cancer cells. Hence- testing of HER2 is important in treatment to indicate candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. However- in the current gold standard- i.e.- the immunohistochemistry (IHC) test- the scoring is based on the pathologistâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s analysis- which has an inter- and intra-observer variation chance due to variability in staining assessment. Automating HER2 scoring using hematoxyline eosin (HE) stained images can overcome these limitations- providing more accurate and consistent results- thereby reducing healthcare costs and enhancing patient outcomes. In this work- we have presented an automated framework for classifying HER2 scores of breast cancer using HE-stained images. The developed framework uses three fine-tuned deep learning models- namely GoogLeNet- ResNet-50- and Vision Transformer (ViT). It applies the proposed hybrid weighted individual voting ensemble (WIVE) to combine the confidence scores of all the constituent models. This approach comprises two independent techniques: the Model-Specific Weights Optimization (MSWO)- customizing weights for individual models- and the Class-Specific Weights Optimization (CSWO)- fine-tunes weights for specific classes using Probabilistic model-building genetic algorithms (PMBGAs). The proposed framework surpasses the existing methods in the literature. The CSWO approach achieves an accuracy of 99.42% and a precision of 99.54%- while the MSWO approach attains an accuracy of 99.07% and a precision of 99.21%. This study outlines an economically feasible and efficient prognostic model with the potential to provide clinically significant inputs. The use of this algorithm might offer a possibility for the replacement of IHC testing- minimizing the variability in HER2 scoring- as well as simplifying the diagnostic process.</p>

Aberrant expression of miRNAs has been observed in various malignancies and may be potential targets for therapy. Our study aims to examine the expression profiles of miR-375- miR-574-3p- and miR-122 in the sera of Egyptian women with BC- benign breast lesions- and a control group. We hope to determine if these miRNAs can serve as minimally invasive biomarkers for BC. This is a case-control study in which 77 patients with newly diagnosed BC- 20 patients with benign breast tumors- and 30 normal healthy subjects as controls were recruited from the outpatient clinic of the National Cancer Institute. The assessment of miRNAs was conducted using RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems). The expression level of miRNA-122 was significantly upregulated in the BC group- while the expression levels of miRNA-574 and miRNA-375 showed significant downregulation in BC patients. Serum miR-122 and miRNA-375 were able to distinguish breast cancer from the benign and control groups in ROC curve analysis- with AUCs of 0.786 and 0.796- respectively. Our results also showed that serum miR-122 and miR-574 are significant predictor variables in the multivariate analysis- after adjusting for age. Our findings suggest that miR-122 may act as an onco-microRNA- while miR-574 and miR-375 may have a main tumour suppressor role. The studied miRNAs may serve as minimally invasive biomarkers for cases of breast cancer and as promising potential therapeutic targets for breast cancer.
,Machine Learning in Breast Cancer Treatment for Enhanced Outcomes with Regional Inductive Moderate Hyperthermia and Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy,Breast cancer is one of the most often diagnosed cancers in women- and identifying breast cancer histological images is an essential challenge in automated pathology analysis. According to research- the global BrC is around 12% of all cancer cases. Furthermore- around 25% of women suffer from BrC. Consequently- the prediction of BrC depends critically on the quick and precise processing of imaging data. The primary reason deep learning models are used in breast cancer detection is that they can produce findings more quickly and accurately than current machine learning-based techniques. Using a BreakHis dataset- we demonstrated in this work the viability of automatically identifying and classifying BrC. The first stage is pre-processing- which employs an Adaptive Switching Modified Decision Based Unsymmetrical Trimmed Median Filter (ASMDBUTMF) to remove high-density noise. After the image has been pre-processed- it is segmented using the Thresholding Level set approach. Next- we propose a hybrid chaotic sand cat optimization technique- together with the Remora Optimization Algorithm (ROA) for feature selection. The suggested strategy facilitates the acquisition of precise functionality attributes- hence simplifying the detection procedure. Additionally- it aids in resolving problems pertaining to global optimization. Following the selection- the best characteristics proceed to the categorization procedure. A DL classifier called the Conditional Variation Autoencoder is used to discriminate between cancerous and benign tumors while categorizing them. Consequently- a classification accuracy of 99.4%- Precision of 99.2%- Recall of 99.1%- F- score of 99%- Specificity of 99.14%- FDR of 0.54- FNR of 0.001- FPR of 0.002- MCC of 0.98 and NPV of 0.99 were obtained using the proposed approach. Furthermore- compared to other research using the current BreakHis dataset- the results of our research are more desirable.

Dawood Salim Mohammed,Enhancing Breast Cancer Detection with Ensemble Machine Learning Models,Topic modeling is a popular technique in machine learning and natural language processing- where a corpus of text documents is classified into themes or topics using word frequency analysis. This approach has proven successful in various biological data analysis applications- such as predicting cancer subtypes with high accuracy and identifying genes- enhancers- and stable cell types simultaneously from sparse single-cell epigenomics data. The advantage of using a topic model is that it not only serves as a clustering algorithm- but it can also explain clustering results by providing word probability distributions over topics. Our study proposes a novel topic modeling approach for clustering single cells and detecting topics (gene signatures) in single-cell datasets that measure multiple omics simultaneously. We applied this approach to examine the transcriptional heterogeneity of luminal and triple-negative breast cancer cells using patient-derived xenograft models with acquired resistance to chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Through this approach- we identified protein-coding genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) that group thousands of cells into biologically similar clusters- accurately distinguishing drug-sensitive and -resistant breast cancer types. In comparison to standard state-of-the-art clustering analyses- our approach offers an optimal partitioning of genes into topics and cells into clusters simultaneously- producing easily interpretable clustering outcomes. Additionally- we demonstrate that an integrative clustering approach- which combines the information from mRNAs and lncRNAs treated as disjoint omics layers- enhances the accuracy of cell classification.
,Machine Learning-Based Breast Cancer Detection Using Histopathological Images,In worldwide women mortality increases extremely every year due to breast cancer and diagnosis of the issue through prediction is very much imperative for healthy lifespan. Here precision of cancer extrapolation is an essential thing for survivability of patient with appropriate treatment. Deep learning algorithms have materialised as influential tool for predicting breast cancer in medical image processing- which leverages capabilities of artificial neural networks (ANN) that are intended to mimic an architecture and functionalities of human brain. Superior features of convolutional neural network (CNN) in deep learning for handling image-based data like- exploiting spatial information- hierarchical feature learning- parameter sharing and data augmentation are important parameters in medical image processing. In this paper CNN algorithm is incorporated for predicting breast cancer in earlier and malignant stage- the results are compared with other deep learning algorithms and our proposed algorithm is expected to give better performance in parameters like accuracy testing- image classifiers- gene sequence classifiers and malignancy detection.
Tengfei Luo,Multiple GPUs-Based Distributed Learning for Classification of Breast Cancer Images,Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women worldwide. However- early prediction of breast cancer plays a crucial role. Therefore- strong needs exist for automatic accurate early prediction of breast cancer. In this paper- machine learning (ML) classifiers combined with features selection methods are used to build an intelligent tool for breast cancer prediction. The Wisconsin diagnostic breast cancer (WDBC) dataset is used to train and test the model. Classification algorithms- including support vector machine (SVM)- light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM)- random forest (RF)- logistic regression (LR)- k-nearest neighbors (k-NN)- and naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes- were employed. Performance measures for each of them were obtained- namely: accuracy- precision- recall- F-score- Kappa- Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC)- and time. The results indicate that without feature selection- LightGBM achieves the highest accuracy at 95%. With minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection (15 features)- LightGBM outperforms other classifiers- achieving an accuracy of 98%. For Pearson correlation coefficient feature selection (15 features)- LightGBM also excels with a 95% accuracy rate. Lasso feature selection (5 features) produces varied results across classifiers- with logistic regression achieving the highest accuracy at 96%. These findings underscore the importance of feature selection in refining model performance and in improving detection for breast cancer.

Sarathkumar M- Dhanalakshmi K S- Madhivadhani D- Revathi V,A Deep Learning Approach for Efficient Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Hybrid CNN-BILSTM with Soft Attention Mechanism,Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the AI domain owing to their exemplary context recognition and response capabilities. However- the potential of LLMs in specific clinical scenarios- particularly in breast cancer diagnosis- treatment- and care- has not been fully explored. This study aimed to compare the performances of three major LLMs in the clinical context of breast cancer. In this study- clinical scenarios designed specifically for breast cancer were segmented into five pivotal domains (nine cases): assessment and diagnosis- treatment decision-making- postoperative care- psychosocial support- and prognosis and rehabilitation. The LLMs were used to generate feedback for various queries related to these domains. For each scenario- a panel of five breast cancer specialists- each with over a decade of experience- evaluated the feedback from LLMs. They assessed feedback concerning LLMs in terms of their quality- relevance- and applicability. There was a moderate level of agreement among the raters (Fleiss' kappa=0.345- P<0.05). Comparing the performance of different models regarding response length- GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 provided relatively longer feedback than Claude2. Furthermore- across the nine case analyses- GPT-4.0 significantly outperformed the other two models in average quality- relevance- and applicability. Within the five clinical areas- GPT-4.0 markedly surpassed GPT-3.5 in the quality of the other four areas and scored higher than Claude2 in tasks related to psychosocial support and treatment decision-making. This study revealed that in the realm of clinical applications for breast cancer- GPT-4.0 showcases not only superiority in terms of quality and relevance but also demonstrates exceptional capability in applicability- especially when compared to GPT-3.5. Relative to Claude2- GPT-4.0 holds advantages in specific domains. With the expanding use of LLMs in the clinical field- ongoing optimization and rigorous accuracy assessments are paramount.

This retrospective study included 377 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer. Patients were divided into training set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢202)- validation set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢87) and test set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢88). The intratumoral volume of interest (VOI) and peritumoral VOI were delineated on primary breast cancers at three different DCE-MRI contrast phases: early- peak- and delayed. Radiomics features were extracted from each phase. After feature standardization- the training set was filtered by variance analysis- correlation analysis- and least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO). Using the extracted features- a logistic regression model based on each tumor subtype (Luminal A- Luminal B- HER2-enriched- triple-negative) was established. Ten models based on intratumoral or/plus peritumoral features from three different phases were developed for each differentiation. Radiomics features extracted from delayed phase DCE-MRI demonstrated dominant diagnostic performance over features from other phases. However- the differences were not statistically significant. In the full fusion model for differentiating different molecular subtypes- the most frequently screened features were those from the delayed phase. According to the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method- the most important features were also identified from the delayed phase. The intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features from the delayed phase of DCE-MRI can provide additional information for preoperative molecular typing. The delayed phase of DCE-MRI cannot be ignored. Radiomics features extracted and radiomics models constructed from the delayed phase of DCE-MRI played a crucial role in molecular subtype classification- although no significant difference was observed in the test cohort. The molecular subtype of breast cancer provides a basis for setting treatment strategy and prognosis. The delayed-phase radiomics model outperformed that of early-/peak-phases- but no differently than other phases or combinations. Both intra- and peritumoral radiomics features offer valuable insights for molecular typing.
MR JebeliHajiAbadi,Classification of Breast Cancer Cytological Images using Vision Transformers,Although cancer therapy suppresses recurrence and prolongs life- it may be accompanied by strong side effects; thus- there is a strong demand for the development effective treatments with fewer side effects. Cancer therapy using plant-derived essential oils is attracting attention as one promising method. This study investigated the antitumor effects of essential oil volatiles on breast cancer cells and identifies four essential oils that display antitumor activity. Breast cancer cells were cultured in a 96-well plate- then one of twenty essential oils was added dropwise to the central well. The plate was incubated at 37Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂªC for 48Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ h and the effect of the volatile components of each essential oil on the surrounding breast cancer cell growth ability was examined using an MTT assay. Gas chromatography was used to investigate the concentration of the transpiration components that may affect cancer cells. Of the 20 essential oils- Lemongrass- Lemon myrtle- Litsea- and Melissa displayed strong anti-tumor effects. These essential oils inhibited the growth of nearby breast cancer cells- even when diluted more than 500-fold. The transpiration component of lemon Myrtle showed the strongest antitumor effect- but was the least cytotoxic to mononuclear cells in normal peripheral blood (PBMC). Each of these essential oils contained a very large amount of citral. The IC50 against breast cancer cells when citral was volatilized from each essential oil was 1.67Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬ÂµL/mL for geranial and 1.31 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬ÂµL/mL for neral. Volatilized citral alone showed strong anti-proliferation and infiltration-inhibiting effects. The transpiration components of Lemongrass- Lemon myrtle- Litsea- and Melissa are thought to inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation due to their high levels of citral.

Thomas LOUIS- Serena Pacile- Pierre Fillard,Time-to-event learning paradigm as a generalized approach to estimate risk of breast cancer using image-based deep learning models,Cancer survivors commonly report cognitive declines after cancer therapy. Due to the complex etiology of cancer-related cognitive decline (CRCD)- predicting who will be at risk of CRCD remains a clinical challenge. We developed a model to predict breast cancer survivors who would experience CRCD after systematic treatment. We used the Thinking and Living with Cancer study- a large ongoing multisite prospective study of older breast cancer survivors with complete assessments pre-systemic therapy- 12 months and 24 months after initiation of systemic therapy. Cognition was measured using neuropsychological testing of attention- processing speed- and executive function (APE). CRCD was defined as a 0.25 SD (of observed changes from baseline to 12â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢months in matched controls) decline or greater in APE score from baseline to 12 months (transient) or persistent as a decline 0.25 SD or greater sustained to 24 months. We used machine learning approaches to predict CRCD using baseline demographics- tumor characteristics and treatment- genotypes- comorbidity- and self-reported physical- psychosocial- and cognitive function. Thirty-two percent of survivors had transient cognitive decline- and 41% of these women experienced persistent decline. Prediction of CRCD was good: yielding an area under the curve of 0.75 and 0.79 for transient and persistent decline- respectively. Variables most informative in predicting CRCD included apolipoprotein E4 positivity- tumor HER2 positivity- obesity- cardiovascular comorbidities- more prescription medications- and higher baseline APE score. Our proof-of-concept tool demonstrates our prediction models are potentially useful to predict risk of CRCD. Future research is needed to validate this approach for predicting CRCD in routine practice settings.

O Thaalbi- MA Akhloufi,Deep learning for breast cancer diagnosis from histopathological images: classification and gene expression,Estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary cancer is the most aggressive type of breast cancer (BC) with higher rate of metastasis and recurrence. In recent years- dietary prevention of BC with epigenetically active phytochemicals has received increased attention due to its feasibility- effectiveness- and ease of implementation. In this regard- combinatorial phytochemical intervention enables more efficacious BC inhibition by simultaneously targeting multiple tumorigenic pathways. We- therefore- focused on investigation of the effect of sulforaphane (SFN)-rich broccoli sprouts (BSp) and withaferin A (WA)-rich Ashwagandha (Ash) combination on BC prevention in estrogen receptor-negative [ER(-)] mammary cancer using transgenic mice. Our results indicated that combinatorial BSpâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Ash treatment significantly reduced tumor incidence and tumor growth (~â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢75%) as well as delayed (~â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢21%) tumor latency when compared to the control treatment and combinatorial BSpâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Ash treatment was statistically more effective in suppressing BC compared to single BSp or Ash intervention. At the molecular level- the BSp and Ash combination upregulated tumor suppressors (p53- p57) along with apoptosis associated proteins (BAX- PUMA) and BAX:BCL-2 ratio. Furthermore- our result indicated an expressional decline of epigenetic machinery HDAC1 and DNMT3A in mammary tumor tissue because of combinatorial treatment. Interestingly- we have reported multiple synergistic interactions between BSp and Ash that have impacted both tumor phenotype and molecular expression due to combinatorial BSp and Ash treatment. Our RNA-seq analysis results also demonstrated a transcriptome-wide expressional reshuffling of genes associated with multiple cell-signaling pathways- transcription factor activity and epigenetic regulations due to combined BSp and Ash administration. In addition- we discovered an alteration of gut microbial composition change because of combinatorial treatment. Overall- combinatorial BSp and Ash supplementation can prevent ER(-) BC through enhanced tumor suppression- apoptosis induction and transcriptome-wide reshuffling of gene expression possibly influencing multiple cell signaling pathways- epigenetic regulation and reshaping gut microbiota.

M Altulayhi- A Alhrgan,Evaluating Study Between Vision Transformers and Pre-trained CNN Learning Algorithms to Classify Breast Cancer Histopathological Images,Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) has become increasingly important for breast cancer survivors- but clinically relevant declines often persist for many years after treatment. This study aimed to investigate whether social relationships can mitigate or prevent this decline in HRQOL. Data were used from the German population-based Mamma Carcinoma Risk Factor Investigation (MARIE) cohort of 2022 breast cancer cases with follow-up information for more than 15 years after diagnosis. Correlations between social integration- social support- and global health status (GHS) as an overall measure of HRQOL were analyzed- and linear regression analysis was performed with structural equation modeling. The majority of participants reported high levels of social integration and social support and moderate levels of GHS. Social integration 5 years after diagnosis was associated with GHS 5 years after diagnosis (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 1.12; 95% CI-Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.25-1.99)- but no longitudinal effects were found.

These results confirm that social relationships positively influence HRQOL in long-term breast cancer survivors and that their association should receive more attention clinically and beyond routine care.
HM Balaha- KM Ali- D Gondim- M Ghazal- ...,Harnessing Vision Transformers for Precise and Explainable Breast Cancer Diagnosis,This study presents a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection from mammogram images through a hybrid feature selection and classification framework. Leveraging the power of XGBoost- a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm- an embedded genetic algorithm is introduced for optimal feature selection. The genetic algorithm refines the feature set by iteratively evolving towards a subset that maximizes the discriminative power for breast cancer diagnosis. Subsequently- the selected features are fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with Random Boolean Networks (RBN) for classification. The RNN-RBN model captures intricate temporal dependencies within the image data- providing a nuanced understanding of the complex patterns indicative of breast cancer. The synergistic coupling of the XGBoost-embedded genetic algorithm for feature selection and the RNN-RBN model for classification results in a robust and interpretable system for breast cancer detection. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of mammogram images- demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. The combination of feature selection through XGBoost- embedded genetic algorithms and RNN-RBN classification showcases the potential for advanced- accurate- and efficient breast cancer diagnosis- holding promise for improving early detection rates and patient outcomes in clinical settings.

To realize this goal- we utilized data from the Surveillance- Epidemiology- and End Results (SEER) databases between January 2010 and December 2020- and meanwhile- enrolled an independent external cohort from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) machine learning algorithm. By applying the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis- we pinpointed key prognostic factors for YBC patients- which were used to create a prediction model capable of forecasting the 3-year- 5-year- 7-year- and 10-year survival rates of YBC patients. The RSF model constructed in the study demonstrated exceptional performance- achieving C-index values of 0.920 in the training set- 0.789 in the internal validation set- and 0.701 in the external validation set- outperforming the Cox regression model. The model's calibration was confirmed by Brier scores at various time points- showcasing its excellent accuracy in prediction. Decision curve analysis (DCA) underscored the model's importance in clinical application- and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots highlighted the importance of key variables. The RSF model also proved valuable in risk stratification- which has effectively categorized patients based on their survival risks. In summary- this study has constructed a well-performed prediction model for the evaluation of prognostic factors influencing the long-term survival of early-stage YBC patients- which is significant in risk stratification when physicians handle YBC patients in clinical settings.

S Hussain- M Ali- U Naseem- ...,Performance Evaluation of Deep Learning and Transformer Models Using Multimodal Data for Breast Cancer Classification,Co-loading of sonosensitizers and chemotherapeutic drugs into nanocarriers can improve the biocompatibilities- stabilities- and targeting of drugs and reduce the adverse reactions of drugs- providing a robust platform to orchestrate the synergistic interplay between chemotherapy and sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in cancer treatment. In this regard- biodegradable manganese dioxide (MnO2) has attracted widespread attention because of its unique properties in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Accordingly- herein- MnO2 nanoshells with hollow mesoporous structures (H-MnO2) were etched to co-load hematoporphyrin monomethyl ether (HMME) and doxorubicin (DOX)- and DOX/HMME-HMnO2@bovine serum albumin (BSA) obtained after simple BSA modification of DOX/HMME-HMnO2 exhibited excellent hydrophilicity and dispersibility. H-MnO2 rapidly degraded in the weakly acidic TME- releasing loaded HMME and DOX- and catalysed the decomposition of H2O2 abundantly present in TME- producing oxygen (O2) in situ- significantly increasing O2 concentration and downregulating the hypoxia-inducible factor 1â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± (HIF-1â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±). After irradiation of the tumor area with low-frequency ultrasound- the drug delivery efficiency of DOX/HMME-HMnO2@BSA substantially increased- and the excited HMME generated a large amount of reactive oxygen species (ROS)- which caused irreversible damage to tumor cells. Moreover- the cell death rate exceeded 60% after synergistic SDT-chemotherapy. Therefore- the pH-responsive nanoshells designed in this study can realize drug accumulation in tumor regions by responding to TME and augment SDT-chemotherapy potency for breast cancer treatment by improving hypoxia in tumors. Thus- this study provides theoretical support for the development of multifunctional nanocarriers and scientific evidence for further exploration of safer and more efficient breast cancer treatments.
Y Chen- J Liu- L Wang- P Jiang- B Pang- ...,Predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes from H &E-stained histopathological images using a spatial-transcriptomics-based patch filter,Early detection of breast cancer and its molecular subtyping is crucial for guiding clinical treatment and improving survival rate. Current diagnostic methods for breast cancer are invasive- time consuming and complicated. In this work- an optical detection method integrating surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technology with feature selection and deep learning algorithm was developed for identifying serum components and building diagnostic model- with the aim of efficient and accurate noninvasive screening of breast cancer. First- the high quality of serum SERS spectra from breast cancer (BC)- breast benign disease (BBD) patients and healthy controls (HC) were obtained. Chi-square tests were conducted to exclude confounding factors- enhancing the reliability of the study. Then- LightGBM (LGB) algorithm was used as the base model to retain useful features to significantly improve classification performance. The DNN algorithm was trained through backpropagation- adjusting the weights and biases between neurons to improve the network's predictive ability. In comparison to traditional machine learning algorithms- this method provided more accurate information for breast cancer classification- with classification accuracies of 91.38Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for BC and BBD- and 96.40Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for BC- BBD- and HC. Furthermore- the accuracies of 90.11Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for HR+/HR- and 88.89Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for HER2+/HER2- can be reached when evaluating BC patients' molecular subtypes. These results demonstrate that serum SERS combined with powerful LGB-DNN algorithm would provide a supplementary method for clinical breast cancer screening.

However- these assays lack explanatory power regarding the underlying mechanisms of the recurrence risk. To address this limitation- we proposed a novel multi-layered knowledge graph neural network for the multi-gene assays. Our model elucidated the regulatory pathways of assay genes and utilized an attention-based graph neural network to predict recurrence risk while interpreting transcriptional subpathways relevant to risk prediction. Evaluation on three multi-gene assays-Oncotype DX- Prosigna- and EndoPredict-using SCAN-B dataset demonstrated the efficacy of our method. Through interpretation of attention weights- we found that all three assays are mainly regulated by signaling pathways driving cancer proliferation especially RTK-ERK-ETS-mediated cell proliferation for breast cancer recurrence. In addition- our analysis highlighted that the important regulatory subpathways remain consistent across different knowledgebases used for constructing the multi-level knowledge graph. Furthermore- through attention analysis- we demonstrated the biological significance and clinical relevance of these subpathways in predicting patient outcomes.

Nevertheless- the existing techniques for diagnosing breast cancer are complicated- expensive- and inaccurate. Many trans-disciplinary and computerized systems are recently created to prevent human errors in both quantification and diagnosis. Ultrasonography is a crucial imaging technique for cancer detection. Therefore- it is essential to develop a system that enables the healthcare sector to rapidly and effectively detect breast cancer. Due to its benefits in predicting crucial feature identification from complicated breast cancer datasets- machine learning is widely employed in the categorization of breast cancer patterns. The performance of machine learning models is limited by the absence of a successful feature enhancement strategy. There are a few issues that need to be handled with the traditional breast cancer detection method. Thus- a novel breast cancer detection model is designed based on machine learning approaches and employing ultrasonic images. At first- ultrasound images utilized for the analysis is acquired from the benchmark resources and offered as the input to preprocessing phase. The images are preprocessed by utilizing a filtering and contrast enhancement approach and attained the preprocessed image. Then- the preprocessed images are subjected to the segmentation phase. In this phase- segmentation is performed by employing Fuzzy C-Means- active counter- and watershed algorithm and also attained the segmented images. Later- the segmented images are provided to the pixel selection phase. Here- the pixels are selected by the developed hybrid model Conglomerated Aphid with Galactic Swarm Optimization (CAGSO) to attain the final segmented pixels. Then- the selected segmented pixel is fed in to feature extraction phase for attaining the shape features and the textual features. Further- the acquired features are offered to the optimal weighted feature selection phase- and also their weights are tuned tune by the developed CAGSO. Finally- the optimal weighted features are offered to the breast cancer detection phase. Finally- the developed breast cancer detection model secured an enhanced performance rate than the classical approaches throughout the experimental analysis.

OO Oladimeji- I McLoughlin- S Unnikrishnan,Volumetric Attention Mechanism-Based Deep Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis in Digital Breast Tomosynthesis,Evaluation of the programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) combined positive score (CPS) is vital to predict the efficacy of the immunotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)- but pathologists show substantial variability in the consistency and accuracy of the interpretation. It is of great importance to establish an objective and effective method which is highly repeatable. We proposed a model in a deep learning-based framework- which at the patch level incorporated cell analysis and tissue region analysis- followed by the whole-slide level fusion of patch results. Three rounds of ring studies (RSs) were conducted. Twenty-one pathologists of different levels from four institutions evaluated the PD-L1 CPS in TNBC specimens as continuous scores by visual assessment and our artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted method. In the visual assessment- the interpretation results of PD-L1 (Dako 22C3) CPS by different levels of pathologists have significant differences and showed weak consistency. Using AI-assisted interpretation- there were no significant differences between all pathologists (Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.43)- and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) value was increased from 0.618 [95% confidence interval (CI)â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.524-0.719] to 0.931 (95% CIâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.902-0.955).

The specificity value was 33% in Task I- and 25% in Task II- respectively. In Task III- the respective specificity value was 30% (vs. atypia)- 30% (vs. DCIS)- and 46% (vs. invasive tumor). In Task IV- the specificity was 35%. The AUC values for the 4 tasks were 0.72- 0.67- 0.70/0.73/0.72- and 0.67- respectively. Conclusion: Deep learning of digital mammograms containing BI-RADS 4 findings can identify lesions that may not need breast biopsy- leading to potential reduction of unnecessary procedures and the attendant costs and stress.

Reusing of publicly available datasets has the potential to fill this gap. Specifically in the domain of breast cancer- a large archive of publicly accessible medical images along with the corresponding clinical data is available at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). However- existing datasets cannot be directly used as they are heterogeneous and cannot be effectively filtered for selecting specific image types required to develop AI models. This work focuses on the development of a homogenized dataset in the domain of breast cancer including clinical and imaging data. Five datasets were acquired from the TCIA and were harmonized. For the clinical data harmonization- a common data model was developed and a repeatable- documented ""extract-transform-load"" process was defined and executed for their homogenization. Further- Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine (DICOM) information was extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and made accessible and searchable. The resulting harmonized dataset includes information about 2-035 subjects with breast cancer. Further- a platform named RV-Cherry-Picker enables search over both the clinical and diagnostic imaging datasets- providing unified access- facilitating the downloading of all study imaging that correspond to specific series' characteristics (e.g.- dynamic contrast-enhanced series)- and reducing the burden of acquiring the appropriate set of images for the respective AI model scenario. RV-Cherry-Picker provides access to the largest- publicly available- homogenized- imaging/clinical dataset for breast cancer to develop AI models on top. We present a solution for creating merged public datasets supporting AI model development- using as an example the breast cancer domain and magnetic resonance imaging images. â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«Â¬Â¨Â¬Â¢ The proposed platform allows unified access to the largest- homogenized public imaging dataset for breast cancer. â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«Â¬Â¨Â¬Â¢ A methodology for the semantically enriched homogenization of public clinical data is presented. â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«Â¬Â¨Â¬Â¢ The platform is able to make a detailed selection of breast MRI data for the development of AI models."

Implementation of mammographic screening has contributed to a reduction in breast cancer mortality of at least 20% over the last 30 years. Screening programs usually include all women irrespective of their risk of developing breast cancer and with age being the only determining factor. This approach has some recognized limitations- including underdiagnosis- false positive cases- and overdiagnosis. Indeed- breast cancer remains a major cause of cancer-related deaths in women undergoing cancer screening. Supplemental imaging modalities- including digital breast tomosynthesis- ultrasound- breast MRI- and- more recently- contrast-enhanced mammography- are available and have already shown potential to further increase the diagnostic performances. Use of breast MRI is recommended in high-risk women and women with extremely dense breasts. Artificial intelligence has also shown promising results to support risk categorization and interval cancer reduction. The implementation of a risk-stratified approach instead of a ""one-size-fits-all"" approach may help to improve the benefit-to-harm ratio as well as the cost-effectiveness of breast cancer screening. KEY POINTS: Regular mammography should still be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women and women with extremely dense breast tissue should use MRI for supplemental screening or US if MRI is not available. Women need to participate actively in the decision to undergo personalized screening. KEY RECOMMENDATIONS: Mammography is an effective imaging tool to diagnose breast cancer in an early stage and to reduce breast cancer mortality (evidence level I). Until more evidence is available to move to a personalized approach- regular mammography should be considered the mainstay of the breast cancer screening. High-risk women should start screening earlier; first with yearly breast MRI which can be supplemented by yearly or biennial mammography starting at 35-40 years old (evidence level I). Breast MRI screening should be also offered to women with extremely dense breasts (evidence level I). If MRI is not available- ultrasound can be performed as an alternative- although the added value of supplemental ultrasound regarding cancer detection remains limited. Individual screening recommendations should be made through a shared decision-making process between women and physicians."
Thuong-Cang Phan- Hoa Nguyen Huu,Enhancing Breast Cancer Detection with Advanced Deep Learning Techniques for Ki-67 Nuclear Protein Analysis,Breast cancer remains a significant health concern globally- with early detection being crucial for effective treatment. In this study- we explore the predictive power of various diagnostic features in breast cancer using machine learning techniques. We analyzed a dataset comprising clinical measurements of mammograms from 569 patients- including mean radius- texture- perimeter- area- and smoothness- alongside the diagnosis outcome. Our methodology involves preprocessing steps such as handling missing values and removing duplicates- followed by a correlation analysis to identify and eliminate highly correlated features. Subsequently- we train eight machine learning models- including Logistic Regression (LR)- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)- Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM)- Kernel SVM- Naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes- Decision Trees Classifier (DTC)- Random Forest Classifier (RFC)- and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)- to predict the diagnosis based on the selected features. Through comprehensive evaluation metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrices- we assess the performance of each model. Our findings reveal promising results- with 6 out of 8 models achieving high accuracy (>90%)- with ANN having the highest accuracy in diagnosing breast cancer based on the selected features. These results underscore the potential of machine learning algorithms in aiding early breast cancer diagnosis and highlight the importance of feature selection in improving predictive performance.

Four machine learning classifiers were evaluated: k-nearest neighbor, random forest, support vector machine, and eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Results Five radiomic features were selected using LASSO logistic regression. Our radiomics models showed good calibration and prediction values with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.70 to 0.77 and from 0.68 to 0.75 in the training and validation sets, respectively. In the validation set, the SVM model achieved the highest value with an AUC of 0.75, with a sensitivity of 70.5%, specificity of 77.3%, and accuracy of 73.9%. Conclusion MRI radiomics-based machine learning models can be useful for preoperative prediction of SLNM in cN0 breast cancer.</p>"

The combination of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and radiomics unveils functional insights and intricate details that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This study aims to assess the efficacy of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics- focusing on the impact of peritumoral region size on radiomic model accuracy. From January 2022 to November 2023- data were collected from 358 patients with breast nodules- diagnosed via PA/US examination and classified as BI-RADS 3-5. The study used the largest lesion dimension in PA images to define the region of interest- expanded by 2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- and 8â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- for extracting radiomic features. Techniques from statistics and machine learning were applied for feature selection- and logistic regression classifiers were used to build radiomic models. These models integrated both intratumoral and peritumoral data- with logistic regressions identifying key predictive features. The developed nomogram- combining 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral data with intratumoral and clinical features- showed superior diagnostic performance- achieving an AUC of 0.950 in the training cohort and 0.899 in validation.

Juan Gutierrez-Cardenas,"Breast Cancer Classification through Transfer Learning with Vision Transformer, PCA, and Machine Learning Models",The objective of our study was to explore the feasibility of integrating artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for breast cancer detection into a portable- point-of-care ultrasound device (POCUS). This proof-of-concept implementation is to demonstrate the platform for integrating AI algorithms into a POCUS device to achieve a performance benchmark of at least 15 frames/second. Our methodology involved the application of five AI models (FasterRCNN+MobileNetV3- FasterRCNN+ResNet50- RetinaNet+ResNet50- SSD300+VGG16- and SSDLite320+MobileNetV3)- pretrained on public datasets of natural images- fine-tuned using a dataset of gelatin-based breast phantom images with both anechoic and hyperechoic lesions- mimicking real tissue characteristics. We created various gelatin-based ultrasound phantoms containing ten simulated lesions- ranging from 4-20 mm in size. Our experimental setup used the Clarius L15 scanning probe- which was connected via Wi-Fi to both a tablet and a laptop- forming the core of our development platform. The phantom data was divided into training- validation- and held-out testing sets on a per-video basis. We executed 200 timing trials for each finetuned AI model- streaming scanning video from the ultrasound probe in real-time. SSDLite320+MobileNetV3 emerged as a standout- showing a mean frame-to-frame timing of 0.068 seconds (SD=0.005)- which is approximately 14.71 FPS- closely followed by FasterRCNN+MobileNetV3- with a mean timing of 0.123 seconds (SD=0.016)- or about 8.13 FPS. Both models show acceptable performance in lesion localization. Compared to our goal of 15 frames/second- only the SSDLite320+MobileNetV3 architecture performed with sufficient evaluation speed to be used in real-time. Our findings show the necessity of using AI architectures designed for edge devices for real-time use- as well as the potential need for hardware acceleration to encode AI models for use in POCUS.

We aim to automate BPE category from DCE-MRI. This study represents a secondary analysis of the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening trial. 4553 women with extremely dense breasts who received supplemental breast MRI screening in eight hospitals were included. Minimal- mild- moderate and marked BPE rated by radiologists were used as reference.

Majority voting was used to combine the predictions. Internal-external validation was used for training and validation. The inverse-variance weighted mean accuracy was used to express mean performance across the eight hospitals. Cox regression was used to verify non inferiority of the association between automated rating and breast cancer occurrence compared to the association for manual rating. The accuracy of majority voting ranged between 0.56 and 0.84 across the eight hospitals. The weighted mean prediction accuracy for the four BPE categories was 0.76. The hazard ratio (HR) of BPE for breast cancer occurrence was comparable between automated rating and manual rating (HRÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 2.12 versus HRÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 1.97- PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.65 for mild/moderate/marked BPE relative to minimal BPE). It is feasible to rate BPE automatically in DCE-MRI of women with extremely dense breasts without compromising the underlying association between BPE and breast cancer occurrence. The accuracy for minimal BPE is superior to that for other BPE categories.

RNA sequencing analysis were conducted on 45 patients to explore the biological basis of FAIS-DL. 1145 patients (mean age- 50 yearsÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±10 [SD]) were evaluated. Among these patients- 506 were in the training and validation sets (axillary pCR rate of 40.3%)- 127 in the internal test set (axillary pCR rate of 37.8%)- 414 in the pooled external test set (axillary pCR rate of 48.8%)- and 98 in the prospective test set (axillary pCR rate of 43.9%). For predicting axillary pCR- FAIS-DL achieved AUCs of 0.95- 0.93- and 0.94 in the internal test set- pooled external test set- and prospective test set- respectively- which were also significantly higher than those of the clinical model and deep learning models based on single-regional DCE-MRI (all PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ <Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.05- DeLong test). In the pooled external and prospective test sets- the FAIS-DL decreased the unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection rate from 47.9% to 6.8%- and increased the benefit rate from 52.2% to 86.5%. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that high FAIS-DL scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. FAIS-DL has demonstrated satisfactory performance in predicting axillary pCR- which may guide the formulation of personalised treatment regimens for patients with breast cancer in clinical practice.

,[Guideline for HER2 testing in breast cancer (2024 version)],Detection of biomarkers of breast cancer incurs additional costs and tissue burden. We propose a deep learning-based algorithm (BBMIL) to predict classical biomarkers- immunotherapy-associated gene signatures- and prognosis-associated subtypes directly from hematoxylin and eosin stained histopathology images. BBMIL showed the best performance among comparative algorithms on the prediction of classical biomarkers- immunotherapy related gene signatures- and subtypes.
T Xie- A L Huang- L Y Xiang- H C Xue- Z Z Chen- A L Ma- H L Yan- J P Yuan,[Value of the deep learning automated quantification of tumor-stroma ratio in predicting efficacy and prognosis of neoadjuvant therapy for breast cancer based on residual cancer burden grading],Breast cancer is one of the major causes of deaths in women. However- the early diagnosis is important for screening and control the mortality rate. Thus for the diagnosis of breast cancer at the early stage- a computerâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢aided diagnosis system is highly required. Ultrasound is an important examination technique for breast cancer diagnosis due to its low cost. Recently- many learningâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢based techniques have been introduced to classify breast cancer using breast ultrasound imaging dataset (BUSI) datasets; however- the manual handling is not an easy process and time consuming. The authors propose an EfficientNetâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢integrated ResNet deep network and XAIâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢based framework for accurately classifying breast cancer (malignant and benign). In the initial step- data augmentation is performed to increase the number of training samples. For this purpose- threeâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢pixel flip mathematical equations are introduced: horizontal- vertical- and 90Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂª. Later- two preâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢trained deep learning models were employed- skipped some layers- and fineâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢tuned. Both fineâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢tuned models are later trained using a deep transfer learning process and extracted features from the deeper layer. Explainable artificial intelligenceâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢based analysed the performance of trained models. After that- a new feature selection technique is proposed based on the cuckoo search algorithm called cuckoo search controlled standard error mean. This technique selects the best features and fuses using a new parallel zeroâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢padding maximum correlated coefficient features. In the end- the selection algorithm is applied again to the fused feature vector and classified using machine learning algorithms. The experimental process of the proposed framework is conducted on a publicly available BUSI and obtained 98.4% and 98% accuracy in two different experiments. Comparing the proposed framework is also conducted with recent techniques and shows improved accuracy. In addition- the proposed framework was executed less than the original deep learning models.

Artificial intelligence using the convolutional neural network (CNN) method has successfully predicted mammography images with a high level of accuracy similar to human brain learning. The potential of AI models provides opportunities to spot breast cancer cases better. This research aims to develop AI models with CNN using the public DDSM dataset with a sample size of 1871- consisting of 1546 images for training and 325 images for testing. These AI models provided prediction results with different accuracy rate. Increasing the accuracy of the AI model can be done by improving the image quality before the modeling process- increasing the number of datasets- or carrying out a more profound iteration process so that the AI model with CNN can have a better level of accuracy.

In hormone-receptor positive (HoR)/HER2 negative early breast cancer (BC) multiple efforts have been made to predict disease recurrence and survival. Machine learning techniques have been used but few studies have looked into their applicability in predicting survival on the basis of clinico-pathological characteristics. The aim of this study was to evaluate a random survival forest model to predict the prognosis of this specific BC subtype. Methods. In this multicenter- retrospective study- patients who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria were included: (1) diagnosis of pathologically confirmed HoR-positive/HER2-negative invasive BC; (2) early or locally advanced- stage I-II-III (3) patients receiving neoadjuvant anthracycline and/or taxane-based chemotherapy- concurrently or sequentially; (4) patients undergoing surgery for primary BC. Survival endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). A random survival forest algorithm was used to develop the predictive model. Ten-fold cross-validation was performed. The C-index and the continuous rank probability score (CRPS) were used to evaluate the discrimination of the predictive model- and a ROC curve was used to evaluate model precision. A cut point analysis based on maximally selected rank statistics was conducted to evaluate the best cut-off in the out-of-bag (OOB) mortality that could maximize DFS and OS prediction. Variable importance was assessed using Breiman-Cutler permutation importance. Results. Overall- 572 patients with HoR-positive/HER2-negative early BC were included. At univariate analysis age- T stage- N stage- grading- ER- PR and Ki67 were found to be significantly associated with DFS and ER- PgR- HER2- pCR ypT and ypN retained statistical significance at multivariate analysis. ER- pCR- pathological T and N stage were found to be significantly associated with OS at univariate and multivariate analysis. The following variables were included in the final model: menopausal status- age- histology- grade- clinical T/N- ER/PgR- Ki67 and HER2- pathological complete response (pCR)- ypT and ypN. For DFS- the cross-validated C-index was 0.68 (95% CI 0.63-0.73) and the OOB CRPS was 0.15- with a OOB performance error of 0.31. The AUC calculated at 60 months was 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.94). Out-of bag RSF-based risk scores for individual patients were calculated and an optimal cut-off of 22.58 was identified. The HR between high risk and low risk group was 3.08 (95% CI 2.16-4.39- p&lt; 0.001). For OS- the cross-validated C-index was 0.66 (95% CI 0.60-0.71) and the OOB CRPS was 0.17- with a OOB performance error of 0.35. The AUC calculated at 60 months 0.91 (95% CI 0.88-0.95). An optimal cut-off of 21.54 was identified and the HR between low risk and high risk group was 2.50 (95% CI 1.73-3.61- p&lt; 0.001). For DFS- the most important variables were cN (9.00)- ypN (7.35)- ER (7.21)- ypT (5.38)- PgR (4.11)- pCR (4.01) and age (2.82) while for OS the most important variables were cN (7.88)- ER (5.37)- PgR (3.61)- age (3.37)- pCR (2.80)- ypT (2.64) and ypN (2.60). Discussion. We analyzed the performance of RSF in the prediction of DFS and OS based on the contribution of clinico-pathological features commonly available at the baseline of the NCT and post-surgery. By selecting patients with HoR-positive HER2-negative disease- we were able to show which clinico-pathological features within a ML model have greater predictive importance. The model could be integrated with image-based tumor and radiology features to improve its predictive accuracy. This retrospective multicenter study suggests that the combination of easily accessible clinico-pathological features within a ML model may reliably predict DFS and OS in the context of HoR-positive/HER2-negative BCs.

Multiple first treatment lines are currently available- determined by several patient-specific factors that need to be considered in the decision-making process. To present CureMate- a Clinical Decision Support System to predict the most effective initial treatment for BC patients. Different artificial intelligence models based on demographic- anatomopathological and magnetic resonance imaging variables are studied. CureMate's web application allows for easy use of the best model. A database of 232 BCE patients- each described by 29 variables- was established. Out of four machine learning algorithms- specifically Decision Tree Classifier (DTC)- Gaussian Naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes (GNB)- k-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)- and Support Vector Machine (SVM)- the most suitable model for the task was identified- optimized and independently tested. SVM was identified as the best model for BC treatment planning- resulting in a test accuracy of 0.933. CureMate's web application- including the SVM model- allows for introducing the relevant patient variables and displays the suggested first treatment step- as well as a diagram of the following steps. The results demonstrate CureMate's high accuracy and effectiveness in clinical settings- indicating its potential to aid practitioners in making informed therapeutic decisions.

Zambelli,70P Development and validation of a machine learning (ML) nomogram to predict RSClin results and guide adjuvant treatment of node-negative (N0) hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor-negative (HER2-) early breast cancer (eBC) in Europe,Breast cancer is a prominent contributor to mortality associated with cancer in the female population on a global scale. The timely identification and precise categorization of breast cancer are of utmost importance in enhancing patient prognosis. Nevertheless- the task of precisely categorizing breast cancer based on ultrasound imaging continues to present difficulties- primarily due to the presence of dense breast tissues and their inherent heterogeneity. This study presents a unique approach for breast cancer categorization utilizing the wavelet based vision transformer network. To enhance the neural networkâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s receptive fields- we have incorporated the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) into the network input. This technique enables the capture of significant features in the frequency domain. The proposed model exhibits the capability to effectively capture intricate characteristics of breast tissue- hence enabling correct classification of breast cancer with a notable degree of precision and efficiency. We utilized two breast tumor ultrasound datasets- including 780 cases from Baheya hospital in Egypt and 267 patients from the UDIAT Diagnostic Centre of Sabadell in Spain. The findings of our study indicate that the proposed transformer network achieves exceptional performance in breast cancerclassification. With an AUC rate of 0.984 and 0.968 on both datasets- our approach surpasses conventional deep learning techniques- establishing itself as the leading method in this domain. This study signifies a noteworthy advancement in the diagnosis and categorization of breast cancer- showcasing the potential of the proposed transformer networks to enhance the efficacy of medical imaging analysis.

In the modified version of VGG19- eight additional layers were integrated- comprising four batch normalization layers and four additional pooling layers (two max pooling and two average pooling). The CBAM was incorporated into the YOLOv5 model structure after each feature fusion. The experiment was carried out using a sizable benchmark dataset of breast tomography images. A total of 22-032 DBT examinations from 5-060 patients were included in the data. Test accuracy- training loss- and training accuracy showed better performance with our proposed architecture than with previous models. Hence- the modified VGG19 classified DBT images more accurately than previously possible using pre-trained model-based architectures. Furthermore- a YOLOv5-based CBAM precisely discriminated between benign lesions and those that were malignant. DBT images can be classified using modified VGG19 with accuracy greater than the previously available pre-trained models-based architectures. Furthermore- a YOLOv5-based CBAM can precisely distinguish between benign and cancerous lesions. The proposed two-tier DL algorithm- combining a modified VGG19 model for image classification and YOLOv5-CBAM for lesion detection- can improve the accuracy- efficiency- and reliability of breast cancer screening and diagnosis through innovative artificial intelligence-driven methodologies.
Bassam Hassan- Zuheir Alshehabi,A case report of coexisting breast cancer with peritoneal- cutaneous tuberculosis- and potential Pott's disease: therapeutic and diagnostic challenges,Radiation therapy is one of the crucial treatment modalities for cancer. An excellent radiation therapy plan relies heavily on an outstanding dose distribution map- which is traditionally generated through repeated trials and adjustments by experienced physicists. However- this process is both time-consuming and labor-intensive- and it comes with a degree of subjectivity. Now- with the powerful capabilities of deep learning- we are able to predict dose distribution maps more accurately- effectively overcoming these challenges. In this study- we propose a novel Swin-UMamba-Channel prediction model specifically designed for predicting the dose distribution of patients with left breast cancer undergoing radiotherapy after total mastectomy. This model integrates anatomical position information of organs and ray angle information- significantly enhancing prediction accuracy. Through iterative training of the generator (Swin-UMamba) and discriminator- the model can generate images that closely match the actual dose- assisting physicists in quickly creating DVH curves and shortening the treatment planning cycle. Our model exhibits excellent performance in terms of prediction accuracy- computational efficiency- and practicality- and its effectiveness has been further verified through comparative experiments with similar networks. The results of the study indicate that our model can accurately predict the clinical dose of breast cancer patients undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). The predicted dose range is from 0 to 50â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤Gy- and compared with actual data- it shows a high accuracy with an average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86. Specifically- the average dose change rate for the planning target volume ranges from 0.28â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤% to 1.515â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤%- while the average dose change rates for the right and left lungs are 2.113â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤% and 0.508â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤%- respectively. Notably- due to their small sizes- the heart and spinal cord exhibit relatively higher average dose change rates- reaching 3.208â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤% and 1.490â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤%- respectively. In comparison with similar dose studies- our model demonstrates superior performance. Additionally- our model possesses fewer parameters- lower computational complexity- and shorter processing time- further enhancing its practicality and efficiency. These findings provide strong evidence for the accuracy and reliability of our model in predicting doses- offering significant technical support for IMRT in breast cancer patients. This study presents a novel Swin-UMamba-Channel dose prediction model- and its results demonstrate its precise prediction of clinical doses for the target area of left breast cancer patients undergoing total mastectomy and IMRT. These remarkable achievements provide valuable reference data for subsequent plan optimization and quality control- paving a new path for the application of deep learning in the field of radiation therapy.
Khadija Aguerchi- Y. Jabrane- Maryam Habba- Amir Hajjam El Hassani,A CNN Hyperparameters Optimization Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Mammography Breast Cancer Classification,Objectives: To develop a model for the prediction of Breast cancer. Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases and it is regarded as the second leading cause of death in women throughout the sphere. Former detection of cancer can save the patient's life. Outliers can have an impact on the model's performance. For this reason- eliminating outliers is the first factor to be considered. Methods: In this study- the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset was used. It consists of 569 instances of which 357 instances are benign and 212 are malignant cases. It has 32 attributes including two class attribute labels (diagnosis: B= benign- M= malignant)- ID number- and 30 real value attributes. These attributes are computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) procedure of a breast mass and are used to describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The HOTSM outlier detection approach- which handles anomalies in two stages- was proposed in the current study. First- the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) was employed to diminish the influence of outliers. After the analysis had been finished- the non-outlier data was transmitted to an isolation forest- wherein the absolute mean error was calculated. Pearson's Correlation was employed to minimize the dimensionality. Findings: For the performance evaluation- two datasets are generated; one using isolation forest and the other using HOTSM. The performance of both datasets is tested using SVM- Decision Tree- and Random Forest classifiers- highest accuracies are obtained as 97.80 %-96.80%- and 98.4% respectively. It was found that the dataset generated using the proposed method performed well. The proposed model is capable of identifying Breast cancer- more accurately. Novelty: The Interquartile Range has been utilized for altering the traditional isolation forest algorithm- enhancing performance metrics. The thorough removal of anomalies reduces the likelihood of misdiagnosis- yet they cannot exclude all outliers. Keywords: Outliers- Breast Cancer- Accuracy- Machine Learning- Hybrid
Umesh Dutta- Simran Kaushik- Srinidhi Iyer- Ina Singh,A Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Techniques for Breast Cancer Prediction,Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death in women. Early signs of breast cancer can be an abnormality depicted on breast images like breast ultrasonography. Unfortunately- ultrasound images contain a lot of noise- which greatly increases the difficulty for doctors to interpret them. In recent years- computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) has been widely used in medical images- reducing the workload of doctors and the probability of misdiagnosis. However- it still faces the following challenges in clinical practice: one is the lack of interpretability- and another is that the accuracy is not high enough. In this paper- we propose a classification model of breast ultrasound images that leverages tumor boundaries as prior knowledge and strengthens the model to guide classification. Furthermore- we employ the advantages of convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract local features and Transformer to extract global features to achieve information balance and complementarity between the two neural network models which increase the recognition performance of the model. Additionally- an explanation method is used to generate visual results- thereby improving the poor interpretability of deep learning models. Finally- we evaluate the model on the BUSI dataset and compare it with other CNN and Transformer models. Experimental results show that the proposed model obtains an accuracy of 0.9870 and an F1 score of 0.9872- achieving state-of-the-art performance.

The aim of the present study was to validate the quality- clinical usability and institutional-specific implementation of different auto-segmentation tools into clinical routine. Three different commercially available- artificial intelligence-- ESTRO-guideline-based segmentation models (M1-3) were applied to fifty consecutive reference patients who received postoperative local RT including regional nodal irradiation for breast cancer for the delineation of clinical target volumes: the residual breast- implant or chestwall- axilla levels 1 and 2- the infra- and supraclavicular regions- the interpectoral and internal mammary nodes. Objective evaluation metrics of the created structures were conducted with the Dice similarity index (DICE) and the Hausdorff distance- and a manual evaluation of usability. The resulting geometries of the segmentation models were compared to the reference volumes for each patient and required no or only minor corrections in 72Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % (M1)- 64Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % (M2) and 78Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % (M3) of the cases. The median DICE and Hausdorff values for the resulting planning target volumes were 0.87-0.88 and 2.96-3.55- respectively. Clinical usability was significantly correlated with the DICE index- with calculated cut-off values used to define no or minor adjustments of 0.82-0.86. Right or left sided target and breathing method (deep inspiration breath hold vs. free breathing) did not impact the quality of the resulting structures. Artificial intelligence-based auto-segmentation programs showed high-quality accuracy and provided standardization and efficient support for guideline-based target volume contouring as a precondition for fully automated workflows in radiotherapy treatment planning.

The results presented here show that CP methods provide important information about the diminished quality of predictions for individuals of minority racial backgrounds.
Ahsan Fiaz- Basit Raza- Muhammad Faheem- Aadil Raza,A deep fusion-based vision transformer for breast cancer classification,Hormone receptor-positive (HR+)/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (HER2-) breast cancer is the most common type of breast cancer- with continuous recurrence remaining an important clinical issue. Current relapse predictive models in HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients still have limitations. The integration of multidimensional data represents a promising alternative for predicting relapse. In this study- we leverage our multi-omics cohort comprising 579 HR+/HER2- breast cancer patients (200 patients with complete data across 7 modalities) and develop a machine-learning-based model- namely CIMPTGV- which integrates clinical information- immunohistochemistry- metabolomics- pathomics- transcriptomics- genomics- and copy number variations to predict recurrence risk of HR+/HER2- breast cancer. This model achieves concordance indices (C-indices) of 0.871 and 0.869 in the train and test sets- respectively. The risk population predicted by the CIMPTGV model encompasses those identified by single-modality models. Feature analysis reveals that synergistic and complementary effects exist in different modalities. Simultaneously- we develop a simplified model with a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 0.840- presenting a useful approach for clinical applications.

Early detection of this pathology allows to define- for patients- the appropriate treatment which improve the possibility of survival. Consequently- the earlier it is detected- the better the survival rate will be. In last years- big interest has been made on applying deep learning neural networks to BC analysis- detection and classification. Several interesting results have been found but they still needing more improvement and validation. In this frame is located our work which consists on developing and comparing different deep leaning approaches for earlier detection and classification of BC from mammogram images. Different new deep learning techniques are developed resulting on a considerable improvement in the rate of the classification accuracy with more robust models. Simulations are carried out on two data bases illustrating that the new proposed approaches provide significant evaluation metrics in comparison with several commonly known transfer learning architectures.

Although previous studies have introduced artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the assessment performance of ALNM- they all focus on the prediction performances of their AI models and neglect the clinical assistance to the radiologists- which brings some issues to the clinical practice. To this end- we propose a human-AI collaboration strategy for ALNM diagnosis of early breast cancer- in which a novel deep learning framework- termed DAMF-former- is designed to assist radiologists in evaluating ALNM. Specifically- the DAMF-former focuses on the axillary region rather than the primary tumor area in previous studies. To mimic the radiologists' alternative integration of the UE images of the target axillary lymph nodes for comprehensive analysis- adaptive mid-term fusion is proposed to alternatively extract and adaptively fuse the high-level features from the dual-modal UE images (i.e.- B-mode ultrasound and Shear Wave Elastography). To further improve the diagnostic outcome of the DAMF-former- an adaptive Youden index scheme is proposed to deal with the fully fused dual-modal UE image features at the end of the framework- which can balance the diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The clinical experiment indicates that the designed DAMF-former can assist and improve the diagnostic abilities of less-experienced radiologists for ALNM. Especially- the junior radiologists can significantly improve the diagnostic outcome from 0.807 AUC [95% CI: 0.781- 0.830] to 0.883 AUC [95% CI: 0.861- 0.902] (P-value <0.0001). Moreover- there are great agreements among radiologists of different levels when assisted by the DAMF-former (Kappa value ranging from 0.805 to 0.895; P-value <0.0001)- suggesting that less-experienced radiologists can potentially achieve a diagnostic level similar to that of experienced radiologists through human-AI collaboration. This study explores a potential solution to human-AI collaboration for ALNM diagnosis based on UE images.

Breast lesion identification and classification are challenging even for experienced radiologists due to the complexity of breast tissue and variations in lesion presentations. This work aims to investigate appropriate features and classification techniques for accurate breast cancer detection in 336 Biglycan biomarker images. The Biglycan biomarker images were retrieved from the Mendeley Data website (Repository name: Biglycan breast cancer dataset). Five features were extracted and compared based on shape characteristics (i.e.- Harris Points and Minimum Eigenvalue (MinEigen) Points)- frequency domain characteristics (i.e.- The Two-dimensional Fourier Transform and the Wavelet Transform)- and statistical characteristics (i.e.- histogram). Six different commonly used classification algorithms were used; i.e.- K-nearest neighbours (k-NN)- Naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes (NB)- Pseudo-Linear Discriminate Analysis (pl-DA)- Support Vector Machine (SVM)- Decision Tree (DT)- and Random Forest (RF). The histogram of greyscale images showed the best performance for the k-NN (97.6%)- SVM (95.8%)- and RF (95.3%) classifiers. Additionally- among the five features- the greyscale histogram feature achieved the best accuracy in all classifiers with a maximum accuracy of 97.6%- while the wavelet feature provided a promising accuracy in most classifiers (up to 94.6%). Machine learning demonstrates high accuracy in estimating cancer and such technology can assist doctors in the analysis of routine medical images and biopsy samples to improve early diagnosis and risk stratification.
Mahdi Ahmadi- N. Karimi- S. Samavi,A lightweight deep learning pipeline with DRDA-Net and MobileNet for breast cancer classification,Purposes: Breast cancer (BC) is a disease in which the breast cells multiply uncontrolled. Breast cancer is one of the most often diagnosed malignancies in women worldwide. Early identification of breast cancer is critical for limiting the impact on affected people's health conditions. The influence of technology and artificial intelligence approaches (AI) in the health industry is tremendous as technology advances. Deep learning (DL) techniques are used in this study to classify breast lumps. Materials and Methods: The study makes use of two distinct breast ultrasound images (BUSI) with binary and multiclass classification. To assist the models in understanding the data- the datasets are exposed to numerous preprocessing and hyperparameter approaches. With data imbalance being a key difficulty in health analysis- due to the likelihood of not having a condition exceeding that of having the disease- this study applies a cutoff stage to impact the decision threshold in the datasets data augmentation procedures. The capsule neural network (CapsNet)- Gabor capsule network (GCN)- and convolutional neural network (CNN) are the DL models used to train the various datasets. Results: The findings showed that the CapsNet earned the maximum accuracy value of 93.62% while training the multiclass data- while the GCN achieved the highest model accuracy of 97.08\% when training the binary data. The models were also evaluated using a variety of performance assessment parameters- which yielded consistent results across all datasets. Conclusion: The study provides a non-invasive approach to detect breast cancer; and enables stakeholders- medical practitioners- and health research enthusiasts a fresh view into the analysis of breast cancer detection with DL techniques to make educated judgements.

DESIGN We conducted a two-round Delphi survey to gather expert opinions regarding the unmet needs supportive care framework for breast cancer survivors. METHODS Initial framework identification and inquiry questionnaire creation was achieved via literature search and expert group discussions- which included 15 experts from nursing practice- clinical medicine- nursing management and nursing education was conducted using a Delphi survey. To establish consensus- a two-round Delphi poll was done- using criteria based on the mean (â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢4.0)- coefficient of variation (CVâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.25) and percentage for entire score (â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢20%). RESULTS Experts reached a consensus- leading to six care modules- and 28 care entries: Tumour Detection Support (three care entries)- Management of Complications of Antitumor Therapy (seven care entries)- Healthy Lifestyle Management (five care entries)- Sexual and Fertility Support (four care entries)- Psychosocial Support (four care entries) and Resource and Linkage Support (five care entries). CONCLUSION To address breast cancer survivors' unmet needs- a supportive framework was developed to actively enhance their health outcomes. However- further refinement and feasibility testing using mobile devices or artificial intelligence are required. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND PATIENT CARE This pioneering framework prioritises addressing unmet needs and equips healthcare providers to assess and manage these needs effectively- facilitating the implementation of programs aimed at improving the well-being of breast cancer survivors.

Yi Zhang- Bolun Zeng- Jia Li- Yuanyi Zheng- Xiaojun Chen,A Multi-Task Transformer With Local-Global Feature Interaction and Multiple Tumoral Region Guidance for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease composed of various biologically distinct subtypes- each characterized by unique molecular features. Its formation and progression involve a complex- multistep process that includes the accumulation of numerous genetic and epigenetic alterations. Although integrating RNA-seq transcriptome data with ATAC-seq epigenetic information provides a more comprehensive understanding of gene regulation and its impact across different conditions- no classification model has yet been developed for breast cancer intrinsic subtypes based on such integrative analyses. In this study- we employed machine learning algorithms to predict intrinsic subtypes through the integrative analysis of ATAC-seq and RNA-seq data. We identified 10 signature genes (CDH3- ERBB2- TYMS- GREB1- OSR1- MYBL2- FAM83D- ESR1- FOXC1- and NAT1) using recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) and a support vector machine (SVM) based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) feature importance. Furthermore- we found that these genes were primarily associated with immune responses- hormone signaling- cancer progression- and cellular proliferation.
Yunfei Tong- Jianrong Jiang- Fang Chen- Guanghua Guo- Chaoren Zhang- Tiana Deng,A novel approach for segmentation and quantitative analysis of breast calcification in mammograms,In biomedical testing- artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced analysis has gradually been applied to the diagnosis of certain diseases. This research employs AI algorithms to refine the precision of integrative detection- encompassing both visual results and fluorescence spectra from lateral flow assays (LFAs)- which signal the presence of cancer-linked miRNAs. Specifically- the color shift of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) is paired with the red fluorescence from nitrogen vacancy color centers (NV-centers) in fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) and is integrated into LFA strips. While GNPs amplify the fluorescence of FNDs- in turn- FNDs enhance the color intensity of GNPs. This reciprocal intensification of fluorescence and color can be synergistically augmented with AI algorithms- thereby improving the detection sensitivity for early diagnosis. Supported by the detection platform based on this strategy- the fastest detection results with a limit of detection (LOD) at the fM level and the R2 value of â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´0.9916 for miRNA can be obtained within 5 min. Meanwhile- by labeling the capture probes for miRNA-21 and miRNA-96 (both of which are early indicators of breast cancer) on separate T-lines- simultaneous detection of them can be achieved. The miRNA detection methods employed in this study may potentially be applied in the future for the early detection of breast cancer.
Jia Guo- Hao Yuan- Binghua Shi- Xiaofeng Zheng- Ziteng Zhang- Hongyan Li- Yuji Sato,A novel breast cancer image classification model based on multiscale texture feature analysis and dynamic learning,"Photothermal therapy (PTT) has garnered extensive attention as an efficient strategy for cancer therapy. Unfortunately- there are currently no suitable photothermal agents (PTAs) capable of effectively treating HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2+ BC) due to the challenges in addressing blood circulation and tumor accumulation. Here- we propose a HER2-specific macrophage biomimetic nanoplatform IR820@ZIF-8@EM (AMBP) for enhanced bio-photothermal therapy of HER2+ BC. An anti-HER2 antibody was expressed in engineered macrophages using the transmembrane expression technique. As an efficient PTAs- IR820 dyes were assembled into ZIF-8 as to develop a ""nano-thermal-bomb"". Homology modeling methods support that the expressed anti-HER2 antibody can specifically recognize the HER2 receptor. Moreover- antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity can also be induced in HER2+ BC cells by AMBP. In vitro fluorescence confocal imaging showed that AMBP promoted the uptake of HER2+ cancer cells while in vivo anti-tumor experiments demonstrated that AMBP efficiently accumulates in the tumor regions. Finally- under spatiotemporally controlled near-infrared (NIR) irradiation- three of the six tumors were eradicated in AMBP-treated mice- demonstrating a safe and effective strategy. In conclusion- our research opens a new paradigm for antibody-specific macrophage- and it is expected that these characteristics will have substantial clinical translation potential for BC treatment."

However- existing methods prioritize extracting multi-modal features to enhance predictive performance- with limited consideration on real-world clinical applicability- particularly in longitudinal NAT scenarios with multi-modal data. Here- we propose the Multi-modal Response Prediction (MRP) system- designed to mimic real-world physician assessments of NAT responses in breast cancer. To enhance feasibility- MRP integrates cross-modal knowledge mining and temporal information embedding strategy to handle missing modalities and remain less affected by different NAT settings. We validated MRP through multi-center studies and multinational reader studies. MRP exhibited comparable robustness to breast radiologists- outperforming humans in predicting pathological complete response in the Pre-NAT phase (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃœAUROC 14% and 10% on in-house and external datasets- respectively). Furthermore- we assessed MRP's clinical utility impact on treatment decision-making. MRP may have profound implications for enrolment into NAT trials and determining surgery extensiveness.

El-Baz,A Novel Machine Learning Approach for Predicting Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy Response in Breast Cancer: Integration of Multimodal Radiomics With Clinical and Molecular Subtype Markers,Breast cancer diagnosis is a crucial domain where Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) integration holds immense importance. Understanding AI model decisions not only enhances trust but also aids in treatment strategies. However- the need for explainability must address privacy concerns- prompting the exploration of Federated Learning. This study explores the intersection of Explainable AI- Privacy- and Federated Learning in breast cancer diagnosis. Utilizing Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset and Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset- our results showcase that Federated Learning enhances user privacy while maintaining performance- achieving an accuracy of 97.59% and F1 score of 98.393% in Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset using artificial neural networks and 97.14% accuracy and 95.65% F1 score in Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset employing XGBoost. By computing SHAP values locally- we maintain explainability while enhancing privacy. Our findings highlight the potential of federated learning in maintaining privacy and explainability- advancing breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.
P Kalpana- P Tamije Selvy,A novel machine learning model for breast cancer detection using mammogram images,Precariousness has been associated with an increase in breast cancer mortality- but the links between precariousness- stage at diagnosis and care pathways are little explored. The objective of the DESSEIN study was to assess the impact of precariousness on disease and care pathways. Prospective observational study in â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â©le-de-France comparing precarious and non-precarious patients consulting for breast cancer and followed for 1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ year. In total- 875Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ patients were included between 2016Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ and 2019Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ in 19Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ institutions: 543Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ non-precarious patients and 332Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ precarious patients. Precarious patients had a more advanced stage at diagnosis (55% T1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ vs. 63%- 30% N+ vs 19%- P=0.0006)- had a higher risk of not receiving initially planned treatment (4 vs. 1%- P=0.004)- and participated less in clinical trials (5 vs. 9%- P=0.03). Non-use of supportive oncology care was 2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ times more frequent among patients in precarious situations (P<0.001). During treatment- 33% of deprived patients reported a loss of income- compared with 24% of non-deprived patients (P<0.001). At 12Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ months from diagnosis- lay-offs were 2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ times more frequent in precarious patients (P=0.0001). Precariousness affects all stages of the cancer history and care pathway. Particular attention needs to be paid to vulnerable populations- considering issues of accessibility and affordability of care- health literacy and possible implicit bias from the care providers.
Lizhe Wang- Yu Wang- Yueyang Li- Li Zhou- Sihan Liu- Yongyi Cao- Yuzhi Li- Shenting Liu- Jiahui Du- Jin Wang- Ting Zhu,A prospective diagnostic model for breast cancer utilizing machine learning to examine the molecular immune infiltrate in HSPB6,Breast cancer (BC) is the most dominant kind of cancer- which grows continuously and serves as the second highest cause of death for women worldwide. Early BC prediction helps decrease the BC mortality rate and improve treatment plans. Ultrasound is a popular and widely used imaging technique to detect BC at an earlier stage. Segmenting and classifying the tumors from ultrasound images is difficult. This paper proposes an optimal deep learning (DL)-based BC detection system with effective pre-trained transfer learning models-based segmentation and feature learning mechanisms. The proposed system comprises five phases: preprocessing- segmentation- feature learning- selection- and classification. Initially- the ultrasound images are collected from the breast ultrasound images (BUSI) dataset- and the preprocessing operations- such as noise removal using the Wiener filter and contrast enhancement using histogram equalization- are performed on the collected data to improve the dataset quality. Then- the segmentation of cancer-affected regions from the preprocessed data is done using a dilated convolution-based U-shaped network (DCUNet). The features are extracted or learned from the segmented images using spatial and channel attention including densely connected convolutional network-121 (SCADN-121). Afterwards- the system applies an enhanced cuckoo search optimization (ECSO) algorithm to select the features from the extracted feature set optimally. Finally- the ECSO-tuned long short-term memory (ECSO-LSTM) was utilized to classify BC into '3' classes- such as normal- benign- and malignant. The experimental outcomes proved that the proposed system attains 99.86% accuracy for BC classification- which is superior to the existing state-of-the-art methods.

Chang Liu- Priya Patel- Dooman Arefan- Margarita Zuley- Jules Sumkin- Shandong Wu,A Radiomic-Clinical Model of Contrast-Enhanced Mammography for Breast Cancer Biopsy Outcome Prediction,Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women worldwide and ranks second in cancer-related mortality- comprising 11.6 percent of all cancer cases. Given that survival outcomes are largely contingent on the stage at which the disease is detected- early detection plays a pivotal role in securing the best prognosis for patients. Machine Learning algorithms are increasingly employed in breast cancer diagnosis due to their accuracy and capacity to anticipate the likelihood of recurrence. In this research- Support Vector Machine (SVM) was chosen as one of the classifiers- recognized for its precise predictive capabilities in cancer prediction and prognosis. To enhance model accuracy and mitigate variance- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) feature selection was incorporated into the study. Among the methods explored- the boosting ensemble method utilizing SVM as the base classifier demonstrated superior performance in breast cancer prediction. SVM as the base classifier with boosting ensemble method has outperformed the SVM models by increasing the accuracy value from 94% to 96% with a precision and recall score of 97%. Consequently- this research contributes to the advancement of patient diagnosis by implementing a classification algorithm tailored for breast cancer prediction.

The implementation of Deep Neural Network (DNN) technology in conjunction with Sequential Forward Floating Selection (SFFS) and Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (TSVD) entropy enable adaptive learning from multi-omics gene data. Five machine learning classifiers are used for classification purpose. Hybrid-OmniSeq uses a variety of machine learning classifiers in a thorough analytical process to achieve remarkable diagnostic accuracy. Deep Learning-based multi-omics sequential approach was evaluated using METABRIC RNA-seq data sets of intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer. According to test results- Logistic Regression (LR) had ER (Estrogen Receptor) status values of 94.51%- ER status values of 96.33%- and HER2 (Human Epidermal growth factor Receptor) status values of 92.3%; Random Forest (RF) had ER status values of 93.77%- ER status values of 95.23%- and HER2 status values of 93.4%. LR and RF increase the cancer detection accuracy for all subtypes when compared to alternative machine learning classifiers or the majority voting method- providing a comprehensive understanding of the underlying causes of breast cancer.

The hematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained slices of biopsy tissues contain a large amount of information on tumor epithelial cells and stromal. The fusion of pathological image features and clinicopathological features is expected to build a model to predict pCR of NAC in breast cancer. Methods: We retrospectively collected a total of 440 breast cancer patients from three hospitals who underwent NAC. HE-stained slices of biopsy tissues were scanned to form whole-slide images (WSIs)- and pathological images of representative regions of interest (ROI) of each WSI were selected at different magnifications. Based on several different deep learning models- we propose a novel feature extraction method on pathological images with different magnifications. Further- fused with clinicopathological features- a multimodal breast cancer NAC pCR prediction model based on a support vector machine (SVM) classifier was developed and validated with two additional validation cohorts (VCs). Results: Through experimental validation of several different deep learning models- we found that the breast cancer pCR prediction model based on the SVM classifier- which uses the VGG16 model for feature extraction of pathological images at â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢20 magnification- has the best prediction efficacy. The area under the curve (AUC) of deep learning pathological model (DPM) were 0.79- 0.73- and 0.71 for TC- VC1- and VC2- respectively- all of which exceeded 0.70. The AUCs of clinical model (CM)- a clinical prediction model established by using clinicopathological features- were 0.79 for TC- 0.73 for VC1- and 0.71 for VC2- respectively. The multimodal deep learning clinicopathological model (DPCM) established by fusing pathological images and clinicopathological features improved the AUC of TC from 0.79 to 0.84. The AUC of VC2 improved from 0.71 to 0.78. Conclusion: Our study reveals that pathological images of HE-stained slices of pre-NAC biopsy tissues can be used to build a pCR prediction model. Combining pathological images and clinicopathological features can further enhance the predictive efficacy of the model.
Chenlu Zhang- Nan Li- Pengxia Zhang- Zhimei Jiang- Yichao Cheng- Huiqing Li- Zhenfei Pang,Advancing precision and personalized breast cancer treatment through multi-omics technologies,The most prevalent cancer in women is breast cancer (BC)- and effective treatment depends on being detected early. Many people seek medical imaging techniques to help in the early detection of problems- but results often need to be corrected for increased accuracy. A new deep learning approach for medical images is applied in the detection of BC in this paper. Early detection is carried out through the proposed method using a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) with feature selection and fusion methods. The proposed method may decrease the mortality rate due to the early-stage detection of BC with high precision. In this work- the proposed Deep Learning Framework (DLF) uses many levels of artificial neural networks to sort images of BC into categories correctly. This proposed method further increases the scalability of convolutional recurrent networks. It also achieved 94.93Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % accuracy- 93.66Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % precision- 89.21Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % recall and 98.86Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % F1-score. Through this approach- cancer tumors in a specific location can be detected more accurately. The existing methods are dependent mainly on manually selecting and extracting features. The proposed framework automatically learns and finds relevant features from images that result in outperforming existing methods.
S. S. Boudouh- M. Bouakkaz,Advancing precision in breast cancer detection: a fusion of vision transformers and CNNs for calcification mammography classification,Breast cancer is a major cause of death worldwide. The complexity of endocrine regulation in breast cancer may allow the cancer cells to escape from a particular treatment and result in resistant and aggressive disease. These breast cancers usually have fewer treatment options. Targeted therapies for cancer patients may offer fewer adverse side effects because of specificity compared to conventional chemotherapy. Signaling pathways of nuclear receptors- such as the estrogen receptor (ER)- have been intensively studied and used as therapeutic targets. Recently- the role of the androgen receptor (AR) in breast cancer is gaining greater attention as a therapeutic target and as a prognostic biomarker. The expression of constitutively active truncated AR splice variants in breast cancer is a possible mechanism contributing to treatment resistance. Therefore- targeting both the full-length AR and AR variants- either through the activation or suppression of AR function- depending on the status of the ER- progesterone receptor- or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2- may provide additional treatment options. Studies targeting AR in combination with other treatment strategies are ongoing in clinical trials. The determination of the status of nuclear receptors to classify and identify patient subgroups will facilitate optimized and targeted combination therapies.
Degan Hao- Dooman Arefan- M. Zuley- Wendie Berg- Shandong Wu,Adversarially Robust Feature Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,OBJECTIVE To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for the early prediction of residual cancer burden (RCB) scores during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA RCB III indicates drug resistance in breast cancer- and early detection methods are lacking. METHODS This study enrolled 1048 patients with breast cancer from four institutions- who were all receiving NAC. Magnetic resonance images were collected at the pre- and mid-NAC stages- and radiomics and deep learning features were extracted. A multitask AI system was developed to classify patients into three groups (RCB 0-I- II- and III ) in the primary cohort (PC- n=335). Feature selection was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U- test- Spearman analysis- least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression- and the Boruta algorithm. Single-modality models were developed followed by model integration. The AI system was validated in three external validation cohorts. (EVCs- n=713). RESULTS Among the patients- 442 (42.18%) were RCB 0-I- 462 (44.08%) were RCB II and 144 (13.74%) were RCB III. Model-I achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.975 in the PC and 0.923 in the EVCs for differentiating RCB III from RCB 0-II. Model-II distinguished RCB 0-I from RCB II-III- with an AUC of 0.976 in the PC and 0.910 in the EVCs. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the AI system was consistent across different clinical T stages and molecular subtypes. CONCLUSIONS The multitask AI system offers a noninvasive tool for the early prediction of RCB scores in breast cancer- supporting clinical decision-making during NAC.

Haldorsen- Christoph I Lee- Solveig Hofvind,AI performance by mammographic density in a retrospective cohort study of 99-489 participants in BreastScreen Norway,Objective: The aim of this study was to develop and validate a series of breast cancer-related lymphoedema risk prediction models using machine learning algorithms for early identification of high-risk individuals to reduce the incidence of postoperative breast cancer lymphoedema. Methods: This was a retrospective study conducted from January 2012 to July 2022 in a tertiary oncology hospital. Subsequent to the collection of clinical data- variables with predictive capacity for breast cancer-related lymphoedema (BCRL) were subjected to scrutiny utilizing the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) technique. The entire dataset underwent a randomized partition into training and test subsets- adhering to a 7:3 distribution. Nine classification models were developed- and the model performance was evaluated based on accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- recall- precision- F-score- and area under curve (AUC) of the ROC curve. Ultimately- the selection of the optimal model hinged upon the AUC value. Grid search and 10-fold cross-validation was used to determine the best parameter setting for each algorithm. Results: A total of 670 patients were investigated- of which 469 were in the modeling group and 201 in the validation group. A total of 174 had BCRL (25.97%). The LASSO regression model screened for the 13 features most valuable in predicting BCRL. The range of each metric in the test set for the nine models was- in order: accuracy (0.75â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.84)- sensitivity (0.50â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.79)- specificity (0.79â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.93)- recall (0.50â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.79)- precision (0.51â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.70)- F score (0.56â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.69)- and AUC value (0.71â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.87). Overall- LR achieved the best performance in terms of accuracy (0.81)- precision (0.60)- sensitivity (0.79)- specificity (0.82)- recall (0.79)- F-score (0.68)- and AUC value (0.87) for predicting BCRL. Conclusion: The study established that the constructed logistic regression (LR) model exhibits a more favorable amalgamation of accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- recall- and AUC value. This configuration adeptly discerns patients who are at an elevated risk of BCRL. Consequently- this precise identification equips nurses with the means to undertake timely and tailored interventions- thus averting the onset of BCRL.

The biopsy procedure remains the gold standard for accurate and effective diagnosis of BCa. However- its adverse effects- such as invasiveness- bleeding- infection- and reporting time- keep this procedure as a last resort for diagnosis. A mammogram is considered the routine noninvasive imaging-based procedure for diagnosing BCa- mitigating the need for biopsies; however- it might be prone to subjectivity depending on the radiologist's experience. Therefore- we propose a novel- mammogram image-based BCa explainable AI (BCaXAI) model with a deep learning-based framework for precise- noninvasive- objective- and timely manner diagnosis of BCa. The proposed BCaXAI leverages the Inception-ResNet V2 architecture- where the integration of explainable AI components- such as Grad-CAM- provides radiologists with valuable visual insights into the model's decision-making process- fostering trust and confidence in the AI-based system. Based on using the DDSM and CBIS-DDSM mammogram datasets- BCaXAI achieved exceptional performance- surpassing traditional models such as ResNet50 and VGG16. The model demonstrated superior accuracy (98.53%)- recall (98.53%)- precision (98.40%)- F1-score (98.43%)- and AUROC (0.9933)- highlighting its effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and malignant cases. These promising results could alleviate the diagnostic subjectivity that might arise as a result of the experience-variability between different radiologists- as well as minimize the need for repetitive biopsy procedures.
Ting Ding- Kaimai Shi- Zhaoyan Pan- Cheng Ding,AI-based automated breast cancer segmentation in ultrasound imaging based on Attention Gated Multi ResU-Net,Pathology provides the definitive diagnosis- and Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools are poised to improve accuracy- inter-rater agreement- and turn-around time (TAT) of pathologists- leading to improved quality of care. A high value clinical application is the grading of Lymph Node Metastasis (LNM) which is used for breast cancer staging and guides treatment decisions. A challenge of implementing AI tools widely for LNM classification is domain shift- where Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data has a different distribution than the In-Distribution (ID) data used to train the model- resulting in a drop in performance in OOD data. This work proposes a novel clustering and sampling method to automatically curate training datasets in an unsupervised manner with the aim of improving model generalization abilities. To evaluate the generalization performance of the proposed models- we applied a novel use of the Two One-sided Tests (TOST) method. This method examines whether the performance on ID and OOD data is equivalent- serving as a proxy for generalization. We provide the first evidence for computing equivalence margins that are data-dependent- which reduces subjectivity. The proposed framework shows the ensembled models constructed from models that generalized across both tumor and normal patches enhanced performance- achieving an F1 score of 0.81 for LNM classification on unseen ID and OOD samples.

However- AI readers cannot perform at the level of multi-reader systems used by screening programs in countries such as Australia- Sweden- and the UK. Therefore- implementation demands human-AI collaboration. Here- we use a large- high-quality retrospective mammography dataset from Victoria- Australia to conduct detailed simulations of five potential AI-integrated screening pathways- and examine human-AI interaction effects to explore automation bias. Operating an AI reader as a second reader or as a high confidence filter improves current screening outcomes by 1.9-2.5% in sensitivity and up to 0.6% in specificity- achieving 4.6-10.9% reduction in assessments and 48-80.7% reduction in human reads. Automation bias degrades performance in multi-reader settings but improves it for single-readers. This study provides insight into feasible approaches for AI-integrated screening pathways and prospective studies necessary prior to clinical adoption.
Wei Wang- Lei Liu- Jianxiong Zhu- Youqiang Xing- Songlong Jiao- Ze Wu,AI-Enhanced Visual-Spectral Synergy for Fast and Ultrasensitive Biodetection of Breast Cancer-Related miRNAs.,Breast cancer is a dangerous disease- contributing to a high mortality rate in women. Early detection plays a pivotal role in enhancing survival rates. Breast ultrasound is considered an effective method to help diagnose breast diseases early. Breast ultrasound is inexpensive- easy to perform- non-invasive and painless- so it is often prescribed by doctors in cases where it is necessary to examine the nature of clinically palpable lesions or related symptoms in the breast. In this paper- we introduce a method based on transfer learning and deep feature fusion to classify breast cancer using ultrasound images. The results from our experiments involving 780 breast ultrasound images across three categories (benign- malignant- and normal) indicated that the model using max fusion of deep features outperformed an original CNN in terms of performance- the combination of the maximum value between deep features has a higher performance level with an accuracy of about 1% to 4% compared to the original model. The concatenation fusion of VGG19 and ViT features delivers 1% - 4% times more accuracy than the original model alone

This highlights the critical role of early detection and treatment in boosting survival rates. While conventional diagnostic methods like mammograms- biopsies- ultrasounds- and MRIs are valuable tools- limitations exist in terms of cost- invasiveness- and the requirement for specialized equipment and trained personnel. Recent shifts towards biosensor technologies offer a promising alternative for monitoring biological processes and providing accurate health diagnostics in a cost-effective- non-invasive manner. These biosensors are particularly advantageous for early detection of primary tumors- metastases- and recurrent diseases- contributing to more effective breast cancer management. The integration of biosensor technology into medical devices has led to the development of low-cost- adaptable- and efficient diagnostic tools. In this framework- electrochemical screening platforms have garnered significant attention due to their selectivity- affordability- and ease of result interpretation. The current review discusses various breast cancer biomarkers and the potential of electrochemical biosensors to revolutionize early cancer detection- making provision for new diagnostic platforms and personalized healthcare solutions.
Ahmed Elaraby- Aymen Saad- Hela Elmannai- Maali Alabdulhafith- Myriam Hadjouni- Monia Hamdi,An approach for classification of breast cancer using lightweight deep convolution neural network,Objective Endometrial lesions are a frequent complication following breast cancer- and current diagnostic tools have limitations. This study aims to develop a machine learning-based nomogram model for predicting the early detection of endometrial lesions in patients. The model is designed to assess risk and facilitate individualized treatment strategies for premenopausal breast cancer patients. Method A retrospective study was conducted on 224 patients who underwent diagnostic curettage post-tamoxifen (TAM) therapy between November 2012 and November 2023. These patients exhibited signs of endometrial abnormalities or symptoms such as colporrhagia. Clinical data were collected and analyzed using R software (version 4.3.2) to identify factors influencing the occurrence of endometrial lesions and evaluate their predictive values. Three machine learning methods were employed to develop a risk prediction model- and their performances were compared. The best-performing model was selected to construct a nomogram of endometrial lesions. Internal validation was conducted using the bootstrap method- and the model's accuracy and fit were assessed using the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curves. Results Independent risk factors for endometrial lesions included ultrasound characteristics- duration of TAM therapy- presence of colporrhagia- and endometrial thickness (Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05). Among the machine learning methods compared- the LASSO regression integrated with a multifactorial logistic regression model demonstrated strong performance- with a concordance index (C-index) of 0.874 and effective calibration (mean absolute error of conformity: 0.014). This model achieved an accuracy of 0.853 and a precision of 0.917- with a training set AUC of 0.874 (95% CI: 0.794-0.831) and a test set AUC of 0.891 (95% CI: 0.777-1.000)- closely aligning the predicted risk with the actual observed risk. Conclusion The developed prediction model is effective in evaluating endometrial lesions in premenopausal breast cancer patients. This model offers a theoretical foundation for improving clinical predictions and devising tailored treatment strategies for this patient group.

Traditional methods for classifying breast cancer based on histopathological images often suffer from limited accuracy- which can hinder early detection and treatment. Hence- this paper devises a novel Internet of Things (IoT) based healthcare system using SqueezeNet_Fractional Dung Beetle Optimization (Squeeze_FDBO) for breast cancer detection. Initially- IoT network is simulated- and routing of the histopathological images to the Base Station (BS) is established utilizing FDBO- which is obtained by combining Dung Beetle Optimizer (DBO)- and the Fractional Calculus (FC). At BS- breast cancer classification is done- where input is first processed by a bilateral filter. Then- blood cell segmentation is effectuated using LadderNet- and then- feature extraction is performed. Finally- the multigrade classification of breast cancer is executed utilizing SqueezeNet tuned by FDBO. The efficiency of Squeeze_FDBO is validated using various performance measures- and it is found to record an accuracy of 0.919- sensitivity of 0.913- specificity of 0.923- Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 0.920- and Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 0.908- and a better routing performance with energy of 0.405â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤J- distance of 6.901â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤m- and delay of 0.650mS.

Alsenan- Usman Tariq- Isaac Ofori,An EfficientNet integrated ResNet deep network and explainable AI for breast lesion classification from ultrasound images,Among female malignancies- breast cancer is still rather frequent globally. Mammography- an essential diagnostic tool- provides a non-invasive means of early detection.

Data pre-processing involves cleaning- encoding- and partitioning for training and testing. The architecture comprises ReLU activation- dropout for overfitting mitigation- and a sigmoid output for binary classification.

Many times- it is faced that despite rigorous exercise and training- not all patients get benefited as expected. The primary objective of this study was to develop a machine learning program for prediction of mean heart dose before left breast radiotherapy under vDIBH. The present work is based on the dosimetric parameters of eighty-two left breast cancer patients- who have undergone modified radical mastectomy- enrolled for their radiation treatment. The trained machine learning algorithm employed linear regression to establish a correlation between Haller Index and heart mean dose (HMD) received during the ca left breast cancer radiotherapy. Subsequently- HMD values were used to model the regression relationship with maximum heart distance (MHD). The method adopted is beneficial in patient selection and assessment for suitability of patients' radiotherapy planning under vDIBH treatment technique. For data from 21 test patients- the mean of HMD obtained from the treatment planning system (TPS) and the mean of predicted HMD by developed program were found to be 468.76 cGy and 464.66 cGy- respectively. The present work facilitates precise HMD prediction in left breast cancer radiation therapy even before starting the treatment planning process. Additionally- this program offers suggestions in terms of modifications in treatment settings for even better results of vDIBH techniques if not matches with the anticipated results.
Ling Liao- Eva M Aagaard,An open codebase for enhancing transparency in deep learning-based breast cancer diagnosis utilizing CBIS-DDSM data,In breast cancer- several gene expression assays have been developed to provide a more personalised treatment. This study focuses on the prediction of two molecular proliferation signatures: an 11-gene proliferation score and the MKI67 proliferation marker gene. The aim was to assess whether these could be predicted from digital whole slide images (WSIs) using deep learning models. WSIs and RNA-sequencing data from 819 invasive breast cancer patients were included for training- and models were evaluated on an internal test set of 172 cases as well as on 997 cases from a fully independent external test set. Two deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models were optimised using WSIs and gene expression readouts from RNA-sequencing data of either the proliferation signature or the proliferation marker- and assessed using Spearman correlation (r). Prognostic performance was assessed through Cox proportional hazard modelling- estimating hazard ratios (HR). Optimised CNNs successfully predicted the proliferation score and proliferation marker on the unseen internal test set (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ±â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.691(pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001) with R2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.438- and â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ±â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.564 (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001) with R2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.251 respectively) and on the external test set (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ±â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.502 (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001) with R2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.319- and â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ±â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.403 (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001) with R2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.222 respectively).

Meena L C- Joe Prathap P M,An optimal deep learning approach for breast cancer detection and classification with pre-trained CNN-based feature learning mechanism,To explore the value of combined radiomics and deep learning models using different machine learning algorithms based on mammography (MG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer (BC). The objective is to provide guidance for developing scientifically individualized treatment plans- assessing prognosis- and planning preoperative interventions. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical and imaging data from 270 patients with BC confirmed by surgical pathology at the Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between November 2022 and April 2024. Multiple sequence images from MG and MRI were selected- and regions of interest in the lesions were delineated. Radiomics and deep learning (3D-Resnet18) features were extracted and fused. The samples were randomly divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model- and other methods. Various machine learning algorithms were used to construct radiomics- deep learning- and combined models. These models were visualized and evaluated for performance using receiver operating characteristic curves- area under the curve (AUC)- calibration curves- and decision curves. The highest AUCs in the test set were achieved using radiomics-logistic regression (AUC = 0.759)- deep learning-multilayer perceptron (MLP) (AUC = 0.712)- and combined-MLP models (AUC = 0.846). The MLP model demonstrated strong classification performance- with the combined model (AUC = 0.846) outperforming both the radiomics (AUC = 0.756) and deep learning (AUC = 0.712) models. The multimodal radiomics and deep learning models developed in this study- incorporating various machine learning algorithms- offer significant value for the preoperative prediction of ALNM in BC.

Deep learning has the potential to significantly simplify the trial-and-error process involved in inverse planning required by modern treatment techniques such as volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). In this study- we explore the ability of deep learning to predict organ-at-risk (OAR) dose-volume histograms (DVHs) of left-sided breast cancer patients undergoing VMAT treatment based solely on their anatomical characteristics. The predicted DVHs could be used to derive patient-specific dose constraints and dose objectives- streamlining the treatment planning process- standardizing the quality of the plans- and personalizing the treatment planning. This study aimed to develop a deep learning-based framework for the prediction of organ-specific dose-volume histograms (DVH) based on structures delineated for left-sided breast cancer treatment. We used a dataset of 249 left-sided breast cancer patients treated with tangential VMAT fields. We extracted delineated structures and dose distributions for each patient and derived slice-by-slice DVHs for planning target volume (PTV) and organs-at-risk. The patients were divided into training (70%- nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 174)- validation (10%- nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 24)- and test (20%- nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 51) sets. Collected data were used to train a deep learning model for the prediction of the DVHs based on the delineated structures. The developed deep learning model comprised a modified DenseNet architecture followed by a recurrent neural network. In the independent test set (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 51)- the point-wise differences in the slice-by-slice DVHs between the clinical and predicted DVHs were small; the mean squared errors were 3.53- 1.58- 2.28- 3.37- and 1.44 [â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢10-4] for PTV- heart- ipsilateral lung- contralateral lung- and contralateral breast- respectively. With the derived cumulative DVHs- the mean absolute differenceÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ standard deviation of mean doses between the clinical and the predicted DVH were 0.08Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.04Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Gy- 0.24Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.22Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Gy- 0.73Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.46Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Gy- 0.07Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.06Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Gy- and 0.14Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.14Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Gy for PTV- heart- ipsilateral lung- contralateral lung- and contralateral breast- respectively. The deep learning-based approach enabled automatic and reliable prediction of the DVH based on delineated structures. The predicted DVHs could potentially serve as patient-specific clinical goals used to aid treatment planning and avoid suboptimal plans or to derive optimization objectives and constraints for automated treatment planning.
Kaimin Hu- Yinan Wu- Yajing Huang- Meiqi Zhou- Yanyan Wang- Xingru Huang,Annotation-free deep learning algorithm trained on hematoxylin & eosin images predicts epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype and endocrine response in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,With the increasing incidence rate of breast cancer in China- how to effectively improve the accuracy and sensitivity of breast cancer diagnosis has become an important issue facing the Chinese medical industry. In recent years- the application of computer deep learning technology in medical images has become increasingly widespread. It can automatically extract features from images and classify and predict them. At present- deep learning has made significant breakthroughs in the field of medical image analysis. Deep learning algorithms can automatically discover disease features in massive image data- and their performance has also been significantly improved. The purpose of this study was to study and analyze breast cancer MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) images by using deep learning algorithm- hoping to provide help for early diagnosis of breast cancer. The results showed that the accuracy of the early screening prediction system for breast cancer MRI images based on deep learning reached 95.6%- which laid the foundation for the early diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.
Kozue Sakao- Shihomi Hamamoto- Daigo Urakawa- Ziyu He- De-Xing Hou,Anticancer Activity and Molecular Mechanisms of Acetylated and Methylated Quercetin in Human Breast Cancer Cells,Patients with clinically node-negative breast cancer have a negative sentinel lymph node status (pN0) in approximately 75% of cases and the necessity of routine surgical nodal staging by sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) has been questioned. Previous prediction models for pN0 have included postoperative variables- thus defeating their purpose to spare patients non-beneficial axillary surgery. We aimed to develop a preoperative prediction model for pN0 and to evaluate the contribution of mammographic breast density and mammogram features derived by artificial intelligence for de-escalation of SLNB. This retrospective cohort study included 755 women with primary breast cancer. Mammograms were analyzed by commercially available artificial intelligence and automated systems. The additional predictive value of features was evaluated using logistic regression models including preoperative clinical variables and radiological tumor size. The final model was internally validated using bootstrap and externally validated in a separate cohort. A nomogram for prediction of pN0 was developed. The correlation between pathological tumor size and the preoperative radiological tumor size was calculated. Radiological tumor size was the strongest predictor of pN0 and included in a preoperative prediction model displaying an area under the curve of 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-0.72) in internal validation and 0.64 (95% confidence interval: 0.59-0.69) in external validation. Although the addition of mammographic features did not improve discrimination- the prediction model provided a 21% SLNB reduction rate when a false negative rate of 10% was accepted- reflecting the accepted false negative rate of SLNB. This study shows that the preoperatively available radiological tumor size might replace pathological tumor size as a key predictor in a preoperative prediction model for pN0. While the overall performance was not improved by mammographic features- one in five patients could be omitted from axillary surgery by applying the preoperative prediction model for nodal status. The nomogram visualizing the model could support preoperative patient-centered decision-making on the management of the axilla.
Jinhua Wang- Liang Wang- Zhongxian Yang- Wanchang Tan- Yubao Liu,Application of machine learning in the analysis of multiparametric MRI data for the differentiation of treatment responses in breast cancer: retrospective study,While machine learning has advanced in medicine- its widespread use in clinical applications- especially in predicting breast cancer metastasis- is still limited. We have been dedicated to constructing a DFNN model to predict breast cancer metastasis n years in advance. However- the challenge lies in efficiently identifying optimal hyperparameter values through grid search- given the constraints of time and resources. Issues such as the infinite possibilities for continuous hyperparameters like l1 and l2- as well as the time-consuming and costly process- further complicate the task. To address these challenges- we developed Single Hyperparameter Grid Search (SHGS) strategy- serving as a preselection method before grid search. Our experiments with SHGS applied to DFNN models for breast cancer metastasis prediction focus on analyzing eight target hyperparameters: epochs- batch size- dropout- L1- L2- learning rate- decay- and momentum. We created three figures- each depicting the experiment results obtained from three LSM-I-10-Plus-year datasets. These figures illustrate the relationship between model performance and the target hyperparameter values. For each hyperparameter- we analyzed whether changes in this hyperparameter would affect model performance- examined if there were specific patterns- and explored how to choose values for the particular hyperparameter. Our experimental findings reveal that the optimal value of a hyperparameter is not only dependent on the dataset but is also significantly influenced by the settings of other hyperparameters. Additionally- our experiments suggested some reduced range of values for a target hyperparameter- which may be helpful for low-budget grid search. This approach serves as a prior experience and foundation for subsequent use of grid search to enhance model performance.
Sahar Mansour- Heba Azzam- Hany El-Assaly,Artificial intelligence as a negative predictive tool for breast cancer postoperative recurrence,Abstract: Background Breast cancer remains a significant global health challenge- demanding accurate and effective diagnostic methods for timely treatment. Ultrasound imaging stands out as a valuable diagnostic tool for breast cancer due to its affordability- accessibility- and non-ionizing radiation properties. Methods We evaluate the proposed method using a publicly available breast ultrasound images. This paper introduces a novel approach to classifying breast ultrasound images based on segmentation and feature extraction algorithm. The proposed methodology involves several key steps. Firstly- breast ultrasound images undergo preprocessing to enhance image quality and eliminate potential noise. Subsequently- a U-Netâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢is applied for the segmentation. A classification model is then trained and validated after extracting features by using Mobilenetv2 and Inceptionv3 of segmented images. This model utilizes modern machine learning and deep learning techniques to distinguish between malignant and benign breast masses. Classification performance is assessed using quantitative metrics- including recall- precision and accuracy. Our results demonstrate improved precision and consistency compared to classification approaches that do not incorporate segmentation and feature extraction. Feature extraction using InceptionV3 and MobileNetV2 showed high accuracy- with MobileNetV2 outperforming InceptionV3 across various classifiers. Results The ANN classifier- when used with MobileNetV2- demonstrated a significant increase in test accuracy (0.9658) compared to InceptionV3 (0.7280). In summary- our findings suggest that the integration of segmentation techniques and feature extraction has the potential to enhance classification algorithms for breast cancer ultrasound images. Conclusion This approach holds promise for supporting radiologists- enhancing diagnostic accuracy- and ultimately improving outcomes for breast cancer patients. In future our focus will be to use comprehensive datasets to validate our methodology.

If the disease is detected in its early stages- it can be cured. While the use of digital image processing to detect breast cancer is not new- many new approaches are being developed to accurately predict its location. The current approach involves both visual inspection of the tumor region and determining the region in which most of the tumor is concentrated. The primary objective of this study is to determine the most efficient algorithm or combination of algorithms for the detection of breast tumors. Various algorithms have been employed in the proposed work; however- the CNN-Deep Learning model combination is the most effective for the diagnosis of breast cancer. This approach may help radiologists to evaluate screening mammography more effectively.
Thomas Alassane Ouattara- Seydou Golo Barro- Pascal Staccini,Artificial Intelligence System for Automated Breast Cancer Detection in Pathology in Burkina Faso: Methodology Overview,The aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of an ultrasound (US)-based deep learning (DL) nomogram for predicting axillary lymph node (ALN) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients and its potential to assist radiologists in diagnosis. Two medical centers retrospectively recruited 535 node-positive breast cancer patients who had undergone NAC. Center 1 included 288 patients in the training cohort and 123 patients in the internal validation cohort- while center 2 enrolled 124 patients for the external validation cohort. Five DL models (ResNet 34- ResNet 50- VGG19- GoogLeNet- and DenseNet 121) were trained on pre- and post-NAC US images- and the best model was chosen. A US-based DL nomogram was constructed using DL predictive probabilities and clinicopathological characteristics. Furthermore- the performances of radiologists were compared with and without the assistance of the nomogram. ResNet 50 performed best among all DL models- achieving areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.837 and 0.850 in the internal and external validation cohorts- respectively. The US-based DL nomogram demonstrated strong predictive ability for ALN status post-NAC- with AUCs of 0.890 and 0.870 in the internal and external validation cohorts- respectively- outperforming both the clinical model and the DL model (p all < 0.05- except pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.19 for DL model in external validation cohort). Moreover- the nomogram significantly improved radiologists' diagnostic ability. The US-based DL nomogram is promising for predicting ALN status post-NAC and could assist radiologists for better diagnostic performance.

It can easily lead to limb swelling- deformation and upper limb dysfunction- which has a serious impact on the physical and mental health and quality of life of patients. Previous studies have mostly used statistical methods such as linear regression and logistic regression to analyze the influencing factors- but all of them have certain limitations. Machine learning (ML) is an important branch of artificial intelligence- which can effectively overcome the problems of multivariate interaction and collinearity. This study aimed to explore the influencing factors for the occurrence of BCRL in breast cancer patients- and construct a predictive model with ML algorithms and validate its predictive value on this basis. Clinical data of breast cancer patients admitted to Hainan Cancer Hospital from September 2018 to May 2024 were retrospectively collected. BCRL was considered as the outcome measurement- and the data were divided into training and validation sets in a ratio of 7:3. In the training set- random forest (RF)- support vector machine (SVM)- and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithms were used to construct predictive models. The discrimination accuracy of the models was evaluated with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis- sensitivity- specificity- and F1 score. The calibration of the models was assessed using calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) Chi-squared test. Two hundred and forty patients who met the inclusion criteria were screened- and they were randomly divided into a training set (168 patients) and a validation set (72 patients) in a 7:3 ratio. In the training set- 44 cases developed BCRL- while 124 did not. There were statistically significant differences (P<0.05) in hypertension history- number of dissected lymph nodes- postoperative complications- postoperative functional exercises- chemotherapy- radiotherapy- tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage- and level of axillary lymph node dissection between the BCRL and non-BCRL groups. Among the four models- the XGBoost model showed the best predictive performance- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.99 in the training set and 0.89 in the validation set. The XGBoost model demonstrated good calibration in both the training and validation sets- showing good consistency with the ideal model. The ML-based XGBoost model for predicting BCRL exhibits excellent performance and assists healthcare professionals in rapidly and accurately assessing the risk of BCRL occurrence.

This study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models to analyze radiomic features from Automated Breast Volume Scanning (ABVS) images of different peritumoral region sizes to identify the optimal size for accurate preoperative Ki-67 prediction. A total of 668 breast cancer patients were enrolled and divided into training (486) and testing (182) cohorts. In the training cohort- ML models were developed for intratumoral and peritumoral regions (2- 4- 6- 8- and 10Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm). Relevant Ki-67 features for each ROI were identified- and different models were compared to determine the optimal one. These models were validated using a testing cohort to find the most accurate peritumoral region for Ki-67 prediction. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis was performed to identify key radiomic features from the optimal model. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for the intratumoral region combined with the 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral region achieved the highest predictive accuracy- with an AUC of 0.957 in the training cohort and 0.920 in the testing cohort. Calibration curves confirmed reliability- and decision curve analysis demonstrated the highest net benefit. SHAP indicated that 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral radiomic features are more significant than intratumoral features. The XGBoost model using ABVS-derived radiomic features from both the intratumoral and 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral regions provides the most accurate preoperative Ki-67 prediction.

The objective of this study is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in breast cancer diagnosis- highlighting the potential of a range of classifier algorithms- soft and hard voting ensemble approaches- and neural networks as potent tools in medical applications. These models were utilized to assess the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository- consisting of 569 samples and 30 features. Besides- we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) techniques to perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction on the standardized and original features respectively. After conducting PCA analysis- a variety of classifier models- including k-nearest neighbors (KNN)- Lo-gistic Regression (LR)- Decision Tree (DT)- LightGBM (LGBM)- XGBoost (XGB)- Random Forest (RF)- and Naive Bayes (NB)- were employed. Moreover- after the VIF analysis- these classifier models and a Neural Network (NN) model were put into action. Subsequently- the best three and best five classifier algorithms were determined using accuracy metrics- then both soft and hard voting ensemble were executed on these algorithms. The neural network (NN) model underwent training for 500 epochs since beyond that point- the loss curves displayed nearly constant values. This model (NN) were compiled with â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´adamâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ optimizer along with binary crossentropy as loss function.

YOLOv9- a new real-time object-detection model- is ideal for cancer screening. A customized YOLOv9 model with enhancements for detecting breast cancer on the basis of species and morphological diversity has potential clinical significance. The internal dataset consisted of 687 cases split 3:1 for cross-validation. Additionally- 98 cases from external datasets were used for testing. We developed an FS-YOLOv9 model customized for breast cancer detection that incorporated an extra max-pooling layer before the Conv1 of the Adown to enhance high-brightness features. The Adown of the P3 in the backbone was replaced with a high-frequency Haar wavelet convolution kernel- which ignored the low-frequency components during down-sampling to enhance morphology and texture features. The reliability and robustness of our model was determined by measuring the F1 score- the area under curve of free-response receiver operating characteristic (FAUC)- mean average precision (mAP)- recall- and precision- and comparing them with the findings for the official YOLOv9- YOLOv8- YOLOv5 models. In comparison with the official YOLOv9 model- FS-YOLOv9 showed a higher average F1 score (0.700 vs. 0.669)- FAUC (0.695 vs. 0.662)- and mAP50 (0.713 vs. 0.679) in the internal dataset; in the external testing dataset- the FS-YOLOv9 improved the average F1 score- FAUC- and mAP50 by 4.58%- 5.78%- and 4.41% respectively. Our FS-YOLOv9 model showed significantly improved performance in detecting breast cancer- making it more practical for high-risk breast cancer diagnosis.
Ying Piao- Hongtao Chen- Shihai Wu- Xianming Li- Zihuang Li- Dong Yang,Assessing the performance of large language models (LLMs) in answering medical questions regarding breast cancer in the Chinese context,Axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) is the standard of care for breast cancer patients with positive sentinel lymph nodes (SLN)- which are the first lymph nodes that drain the breast. However- many patients with positive SLNs may not have additional positive nodes- making the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis challenging. Reliable prognostic tools are essential for accurately assessing NSLN metastasis. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram has demonstrated effectiveness in this context- but it requires further evaluation within the Iranian breast cancer population. While ALND remains the gold standard- its unnecessary application in patients without evidence of additional positive nodes raises concerns due to potential complications such as lymphedema- nerve injury- and shoulder joint dysfunction. Furthermore- integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques presents an opportunity to enhance the precision of NSLN metastasis predictions. This study conducts an extensive comparative analysis between the MSKCC nomogram and various ML models to predict NSLN metastasis- utilizing a dataset of Iranian breast cancer patients. Employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies- we analyzed 16 clinical features across a cohort of 183 patients. Our methodology includes rigorous statistical evaluations and the training and validation of ML models to assess the precision and robustness of these models compared to the MSKCC nomogram. Our analysis revealed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed the MSKCC nomogram- achieving an accuracy of 72.2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % and an AUC of 0.77- compared to the nomogram's AUC of 0.73. Logistic Regression (LR) also demonstrated competitive performance with an accuracy of 65Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % and an AUC of 0.73. The RF model exhibited high sensitivity (75Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %) and precision (73Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %)- effectively identifying critical predictors of NSLN metastasis- including the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and tumor characteristics such as type and grade. Explainable AI techniques- particularly SHAP values- provided insights into feature importance- enhancing model interpretability. Our study offers a comprehensive comparison between ML models and the MSKCC nomogram for predicting NSLN metastasis among Iranian breast cancer patients. These findings contribute valuable insights to the discourse on personalized treatment approaches- emphasizing the need for tailored prognostic tools across diverse populations. The implications of this research extend to clinical decision-making- potentially improving the accuracy and efficacy of breast cancer management within the Iranian healthcare landscape.
Aslâ€šÃ Ãœâˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±nur Albayrak- Kayhan Nuri Cengiz,Assessment of breast cancer awareness among female pharmacy students at a university in Turkey,Breast cancer remains a pressing global health concern- necessitating accurate diagnostics for effective interventions. Deep learning models (AlexNet- ResNet-50- VGG16- GoogLeNet) show remarkable microcalcification identification (>90%). However- distinct architectures and methodologies pose challenges. We propose an ensemble model- merging unique perspectives- enhancing precision- and understanding critical factors for breast cancer intervention. Evaluation favors GoogleNet and ResNet-50- driving their selection for combined functionalities- ensuring improved precision- and dependability in microcalcification detection in clinical settings. This study presents a comprehensive mammogram preprocessing framework using an optimized deep learning ensemble approach. The proposed framework begins with artifact removal using Otsu Segmentation and morphological operation. Subsequent steps include image resizing- adaptive median filtering- and deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) development via transfer learning with ResNet-50 model. Hyperparameters are optimized- and ensemble optimization (AlexNet- GoogLeNet- VGG16- ResNet-50) are constructed to identify the localized area of microcalcification. Rigorous evaluation protocol validates the efficacy of individual models- culminating in the ensemble model demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Based on our analysis- the proposed ensemble model exhibited exceptional performance in the classification of microcalcifications. This was evidenced by the model's average confidence score- which indicated a high degree of dependability and certainty in differentiating these critical characteristics. The proposed model demonstrated a noteworthy average confidence level of 0.9305 in the classification of microcalcification- outperforming alternative models and providing substantial insights into the dependability of the model. The average confidence of the ensemble model in classifying normal cases was 0.8859- which strengthened the model's consistent and dependable predictions. In addition- the ensemble models attained remarkably high performances in terms of accuracy- precision- recall- F1-score- and area under the curve (AUC). The proposed model's thorough dataset integration and focus on average confidence ratings within classes improve clinical diagnosis accuracy and effectiveness for breast cancer. This study introduces a novel methodology that takes advantage of an ensemble model and rigorous evaluation standards to substantially improve the accuracy and dependability of breast cancer diagnostics- specifically in the detection of microcalcifications.
Yutong Song- Lei Yang- Ning Kang- Ning Wang- Xi Zhang- Shuo Liu- Huichao Li- Tao Xue- Jiafu Ji,Associations of incident female breast cancer with long-term exposure to PM2.5 and its constituents: Findings from a prospective cohort study in Beijing- China,Different imaging tools- including digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT)- are frequently used for evaluating tumor response during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT). This study aimed to explore whether using artificial intelligence (AI) for serial DBT acquisitions during NACT for breast cancer can predict pathological complete response (pCR) after completion of NACT. A total of 149 women (mean age 53Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ years- pCR rate 22Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %) with breast cancer treated with NACT at Skane University Hospital- Sweden- between 2014 and 2019- were prospectively included in this observational cohort study (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02306096). DBT images from both the cancer and contralateral healthy breasts acquired at three time points: pre-NACT- after two cycles of NACT- and after the completion of six cycles of NACT (pre-surgery) were analyzed. The deep learning AI system used to predict pCR consisted of a backbone 3D ResNet and an attention and prediction module. The GradCAM method was used to obtain insights into the model decision basis through a quantitative analysis of the importance maps on the validation set. Moreover- specific model choices were motivated by ablation studies. The AI model reached an AUC of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.63-1.00) (test set). The spatial correlation of importance maps for input volumes from the same patient but at different time points was high- possibly indicating that the model focuses on the same areas during decision-making. We demonstrate a high discriminative performance of our algorithm for predicting pCR/non-pCR. Availability of larger datasets would permit more comprehensive training of the models and more rigorous evaluation of their prediction performance for future patients.
Jiadong Chen- Xiaoyan Shen- Yu Zhao- Wei Qian- He Ma- Liang Sang,Attention gate and dilation U-shaped network (GDUNet): an efficient breast ultrasound image segmentation network with multiscale information extraction,The development and optimization of metal-based anticancer drugs with novel cytotoxic mechanisms have emerged as key strategies to overcome chemotherapeutic resistance and side effects. Agents that simultaneously induce ferroptosis and autophagic death have received extensive attention as potential modalities for cancer therapy. However- only a limited set of drugs or treatment modalities can synergistically induce ferroptosis and autophagic tumor cell death. In this work- we designed and synthesized four new cycloplatinated (II) complexes harboring an isoquinoline alkaloid Câ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ„â€ â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂºN ligand. On screening the in vitro activity of these agents- we found that Pt-3 exhibited greater selectivity of cytotoxicity- decreased resistance factors- and improved anticancer activity compared to cisplatin. Furthermore- Pt-3- which we demonstrate can initiate potent ferritinophagy-dependent ferroptosis- exhibits less toxic and better therapeutic activity than cisplatin in vivo. Our results identify Pt-3 as a promising candidate or paradigm for further drug development in cancer treatment.

Every year- many BC patients die owing to delayed diagnosis and treatment. Increasing researches have indicated that aberrantly expressed circular RNAs (circRNAs) are implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of various tumors- including BC. Hence- this article provides a summary of the biogenesis and functions of circRNAs- as well as an examination of how circRNAs regulate the progression of BC. Moreover- circRNAs have aroused incremental attention as potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for BC. Exosomes enriched with circRNAs can be secreted into the tumor microenvironment to mediate intercellular communication- affecting the progression of BC. Detecting the expression levels of exosomal circRNAs may provide reference for BC diagnosis and prognosis prediction.

Yiqi Sun- Bohan Wan- Xin Liu- Jianguo Dong- Shengjie Yin- Yiqi Wu,Breast cancer and neoplasms of the thyroid gland: a bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization study,Small cohorts of certain disease states are common especially in medical imaging. Despite the growing culture of data sharing- information safety often precludes open sharing of these datasets for creating generalizable machine learning models. To overcome this barrier and maintain proper health information protection- foundational models are rapidly evolving to provide deep learning solutions that have been pretrained on the native feature spaces of the data. Although this has been optimized in Large Language Models (LLMs)- there is still a sparsity of foundational models for computer vision tasks. It is in this space that we provide an investigation into pretraining Visual Geometry Group (VGG)-16- Residual Network (ResNet)-50- and Dense Network (DenseNet)-121 on an unrelated dataset of 8500 chest CTs which was subsequently fine-tuned to classify bone mineral density (BMD) in 199 breast cancer patients using the L1 vertebra on CT. These semi-foundational models showed significant improved ternary classification into mild- moderate- and severe demineralization in comparison to ground truth Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements in trabecular bone with the semi-foundational ResNet50 architecture demonstrating the best relative performance. Specifically- the holdout testing AUC was 0.99 (p-valueâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05- ANOVA versus no pretraining versus ImageNet transfer learning) and F1-score 0.99 (p-valueâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05) for the holdout testing set.

Purpose To evaluate performance improvements of general radiologists and breast imaging specialists when interpreting a set of diverse digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) examinations with the aid of a custom-built categorical artificial intelligence (AI) system. Materials and Methods A fully balanced multireader multicase reader study was conducted to compare the performance of 18 radiologists (nine general radiologists and nine breast imaging specialists) reading 240 retrospectively collected screening DBT mammograms (mean patient age- 59.8 (SD- 11.3) years; all female)- acquired between August 2016-March 2019- with and without the aid of a custom-built categorical AI system. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)- sensitivity and specificity across general radiologists and breast imaging specialists reading with versus without AI were assessed. Reader performance was also analyzed as a function of breast cancer characteristics and patient subgroups. Results Every radiologist demonstrated improved interpretation performance when reading with versus without AI- with an average AUC of 0.93 versus 0.87- demonstrating a difference in AUC of 0.06 (95% CI: 0.04- 0.08; P < .001). Improvement in AUC was observed for both general radiologists (difference of 0.08- P < .001) and breast imaging specialists (difference of 0.05- P < .001) and across all cancer characteristics (lesion type- lesion size- and pathology) and patient subgroups (race and ethnicity- age- and breast density) examined. Conclusion A categorical AI system helped improve overall radiologist interpretation performance of DBT screening mammograms for both general radiologists and breast imaging specialists and across various patient subgroups and breast cancer characteristics.

Fifty-seven patients were enrolled over six months. Biopsies served as the diagnostic ground truth. AC- SoS- and ESD showed significant differences between benign and malignant lesions (p < 0.05)- but ESC did not. A logistic regression model was developed- demonstrating an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.78- 0.96) for distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions. In conclusion- the QUS system shows promise in enhancing diagnostic accuracy by leveraging AC- SoS- and ESD. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and optimize the system for clinical use.

Experiments are conducted utilizing the curated dataset to minimize potential biases in outcomes. Our multi-task framework exhibits superior performance in breast cancer respecting single-task approaches- achieving improvements close to 15% in segmentation and classification. Moreover- a comparative analysis against the state-of-the-art reveals statistically significant enhancements across both tasks. The experimental findings underscore the efficacy of multi-task techniques- showcasing better generalization capabilities when considering all image types: benign- malignant- and non-tumor images.

Our approach capitalizes on two whole-slide image datasets: one consisting of breast cancer cases from the Korea University Guro Hospital (KG) and the other originating from The Cancer Genomic Atlas dataset (TCGA). Furthermore- we visualized the inferred results using an attention-based heat map and reviewed the histomorphological features of the most attentive patches. The KG+TCGA-trained model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics value of 0.749. An inherent challenge lies in the imbalance among subtypes. Additionally- discrepancies between the two datasets resulted in different molecular subtype proportions. To mitigate this imbalance- we merged the two datasets- and the resulting model exhibited improved performance. The attentive patches correlated well with widely recognized histomorphologic features. The triple-negative subtype has a high incidence of high-grade nuclei- tumor necrosis- and intratumoral tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes. The luminal A subtype showed a high incidence of collagen fibers. The artificial intelligence (AI) model based on weakly supervised learning showed promising performance. A review of the most attentive patches provided insights into the predictions of the AI model. AI models can become invaluable screening tools that reduce costs and workloads in practice.
Shengting Wang- Libing Liu- Xiaoming Li- Qian Li- Yufang Wang- Xinghua Feng,cDTL contributes to breast cancer progression through regulating redox homeostasis via affecting the function of system xc,In histopathological image analysis- the feature extraction task for classification proves to be demanding. This difficulty arises from the assortment of histological features appropriate for individual problems and the intricate presence of diverse geometric structures. The method proposed in this study leverages dictionary learning and sparse coding techniques to create priors tailored to specific targets- which is essential for classification purposes. Our approach introduces Penalized Sequential Discriminative Dictionary Learning (PSDDL)- designed to integrate histopathological image features by acquiring structured- class-specific dictionaries. Initially- PSDDL constructs a dictionary from the input data- incorporating label information for each class. Subsequently- the proposed algorithm introduces a penalty and regularization term to amplify the efficacy of the acquired dictionary. Furthermore- the proposed method also tackles the class imbalance in the dataset by leveraging dictionary learning. Mainly- under-sampling is performed on the dataset- and the number of samples of fewer classes is kept for all categories and passed to the dictionary learning algorithm. Extensive experimental results highlight a notable enhancement in classification performance. The proposed structured discriminative dictionary learning technique consistently produces improved accuracies compared to other contemporary methods for classifying the BreakHis breast cancer dataset. Integrating class-specific information into the process of dictionary learning paves the way for enriching the interpretive capabilities of machine learning models while delving deeper into our comprehension of the complex and intricate structures inherent in biological tissues.

Leveraging innovative artificial intelligence (AI) tools and real-world data (RWD)- we aimed to develop a causally interpretable model to identify young BC survivors at risk of developing CVDs. Methods: We designed and trained a Bayesian network (BN)- an AI model- making use of expert knowledge and data from population-based (1036 patients) and clinical (339 patient) cohorts of female AYA (i.e.- aged 18 to 39 years) 1-year survivors of BC- diagnosed in 2009-2019. The performance achieved by the BN model was validated against standard classification metrics- and two clinical applications were proposed. Results: The model showed a very good classification performance and a clear causal semantic. According to the predictions made by the model- focusing on the 25% of AYA BC survivors at higher risk of developing CVDs- we could identify 81% of the patients who would actually develop it. Moreover- a desktop-based app was implemented to calculate the individual patient's risk. Conclusions: In this study- we developed the first causal model for predicting the CVD risk in AYA survivors of BC- also proposing an innovative AI approach that could be useful for all researchers dealing with RWD. The model could be pivotal for clinicians who aim to plan personalized follow-up strategies for AYA BC survivors.
Faris Alrumaihi,Chemoinformatics and machine learning techniques to identify novel inhibitors of the lemur tyrosine kinase-3 receptor involved in breast cancer,Breast cancer remains a leading cause of mortality among women- with molecular subtypes significantly influencing prognosis and treatment strategies. Currently- identifying the molecular subtype of cancer requires a biopsy-a specialized- expensive- and time-consuming procedure- often yielding to results that must be supported with additional biopsies due to technique errors or tumor heterogeneity. This study introduces a novel approach for predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes using mammography images and advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Using the OPTIMAM imaging database- 1397 images from 660 patients were selected. The pretrained deep learning model ResNet-101 was employed to classify tumors into five subtypes: Luminal A- Luminal B1- Luminal B2- HER2- and Triple Negative. Various classification strategies were studied: binary classifications (one vs. all others- specific combinations) and multi-class classification (evaluating all subtypes simultaneously). To address imbalanced data- strategies like oversampling- undersampling- and data augmentation were explored. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Binary classification results showed a maximum average accuracy and AUC of 79.02% and 64.69%- respectively- while multi-class classification achieved an average AUC of 60.62% with oversampling and data augmentation. The most notable binary classification was HER2 vs. non-HER2- with an accuracy of 89.79% and an AUC of 73.31%. Binary classification for specific combinations of subtypes revealed an accuracy of 76.42% for HER2 vs. Luminal A and an AUC of 73.04% for HER2 vs. Luminal B1. These findings highlight the potential of mammography-based AI for non-invasive breast cancer subtype prediction- offering a promising alternative to biopsies and paving the way for personalized treatment plans.
Takuya Nagata- Tadaaki Satou- Shinichiro Hayashi- Prabodh Satyal- Manabu Watanabe- Brannick Riggs- Yoshihisa Saida,Citral in lemon myrtle- lemongrass- litsea- and melissa essential oils suppress the growth and invasion of breast cancer cells,"The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology Artificial Intelligence System (CSCO AI) serves as a clinical decision support system developed utilizing Chinese breast cancer data. Our study delved into the congruence between breast cancer treatment recommendations provided by CSCO AI and their practical application in clinical settings. A retrospective analysis encompassed 537 breast cancer patients treated at the Second Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University between January 2017 and December 2022. Proficient senior oncology researchers manually input patient data into the CSCO AI system. ""Consistent"" and ""Inconsistent"" treatment categories were defined by aligning our treatment protocols with the classification system in the CSCO AI recommendations. Cases that initially showed inconsistency underwent a second evaluation by the Multi-Disciplinary Treatment (MDT) team at the hospital. Concordance was achieved when MDTs' treatment suggestions were in the 'Consistent' categories. An impressive 80.4% concurrence was observed between actual treatment protocols and CSCO AI recommendations across all breast cancer patients. Notably- the alignment was markedly higher for stage I (85.02%) and stage III (88.46%) patients in contrast to stage II patients (76.06%- P=0.023). Moreover- there was a significant concordance between invasive ductal carcinoma and lobular carcinoma (88.46%). Interestingly- triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) exhibited a high concordance rate (87.50%) compared to other molecular subtypes. When contrasting MDT-recommended treatments with CSCO AI decisions- an overall 92.4% agreement was established. Furthermore- a logistic multivariate analysis highlighted the statistical significance of age- menstrual status- tumor type- molecular subtype- tumor size- and TNM stage in influencing consistency. In the realm of breast cancer treatment- the alignment between recommendations offered by CSCO AI and those from MDT is predominant. CSCO AI can be a useful tool for breast cancer treatment decisions."

It is essential to develop deep learning models that are robust to adversarial data while accurate on standard- clean data. In this study- we proposed a novel adversarially robust feature learning (ARFL) method for a real-world application of breast cancer diagnosis. ARFL facilitates adversarial training using both standard data and adversarial data- where a feature correlation measure is incorporated as an objective function to encourage learning of robust features and restrain spurious features. To show the effects of ARFL in breast cancer diagnosis- we built and evaluated diagnosis models using two independent clinically collected breast imaging datasets- comprising a total of 9-548 mammogram images. We performed extensive experiments showing that our method outperformed several state-of-the-art methods and that our method can enhance safer breast cancer diagnosis against adversarial attacks in clinical settings.
Jessica Prunaretty- Fatima Mekki- Pierre-Ivan Laurent- Aurelie Morel- Pauline Hinault- Celine Bourgier- David Azria- Pascal Fenoglietto,Clinical feasibility of Ethos auto-segmentation for adaptive whole-breast cancer treatment,Identification of the molecular subtypes in breast cancer allows to optimize treatment strategies- but usually requires invasive needle biopsy. Recently- non-invasive imaging has emerged as promising means to classify them. Magnetic resonance imaging is often used for this purpose because it is three-dimensional and highly informative. Instead- only a few reports have documented the use of mammograms. Given that mammography is the first choice for breast cancer screening- using it to classify molecular subtypes would allow for early intervention on a much wider scale. Here- we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of combining global and local mammographic features by using Vision Transformer (ViT) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify molecular subtypes in breast cancer. The feature values for binary classification were calculated using the ViT and EfficientnetV2 feature extractors- followed by dimensional compression via principal component analysis. LightGBM was used to perform binary classification of each molecular subtype: triple-negative- HER2-enriched- luminal A- and luminal B. The combination of ViT and CNN achieved higher accuracy than ViT or CNN alone. The sensitivity for triple-negative subtypes was very high (0.900- with F-valueâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.818); whereas F-value and sensitivity were 0.720 and 0.750 for HER2-enriched- 0.765 and 0.867 for luminal A- and 0.614 and 0.711 for luminal B subtypes- respectively. Features obtained from mammograms by combining ViT and CNN allow the classification of molecular subtypes with high accuracy. This approach could streamline early treatment workflows and triage- especially for poor prognosis subtypes such as triple-negative breast cancer.

The potential mechanisms that drive the intrinsic heterogeneity of breast cancer (BC) via EMT transformation have not been identified- presenting a significant obstacle in clinical diagnosis and treatment. Methods: A total of 7-602 patients have been included in this study. We leveraged integrated multiomics data (epigenomic- genomic- and transcriptomic data) to delineate the comprehensive landscape of EMT in BC. Subsequently- a subtyping classifier was developed through a machine learning framework proposed by us. Results: We classified the BC samples into three methylation-driven EMT subtypes with distinct features- namely- C1 (the mammary duct development subtype with TP53 activation)- C2 (the immune infiltration subtype with high TP53 mutation)- and C3 (the ERBB2 amplification subtype with an unfavorable prognosis). Specifically- patients with the C1 subtype might respond to endocrine therapy or the p53-MDM2 antagonist nutlin-3. Patients with the C2 subtype might benefit from combined therapeutic regimens involving radiotherapy- PARP inhibitors- and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. Patients with the C3 subtype might benefit from anti-HER2 agents such as lapatinib. Notably- to increase the clinical applicability of the EMT subtypes- we devised a 96-gene panel-based classifier via a machine learning framework. Conclusions: Our study identified three methylation-driven EMT subtypes with distinct prognoses and biological traits to capture heterogeneity in BC and provided a rationale for the use of this classification as a powerful tool for developing new strategies for clinical trials.

This study identifies TSGJ's key targets and compounds for breast cancer treatment through network pharmacology- machine learning- and experimental validation. Bioactive components and targets of TSGJ were identified from the TCMSP database- and breast cancer-related targets from GeneCards- PharmGkb- and RNA-seq datasets. Intersection of these targets revealed therapeutic targets of TSGJ. PPI analysis was performed via STRING- and machine learning methods (SVM- RF- GLM- XGBoost) identified key targets- validated by GSE70905- GSE70947- GSE22820- and TCGA-BRCA datasets. Pathway analyses and molecular docking were performed. TSGJ and core compounds' effectiveness was confirmed by MTT and RT-qPCR assays. 160 common targets of TSGJ were identified- with 30Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ hub targets from PPI analysis. Five predictive targets (HIF1A- CASP8- FOS- EGFR- PPARG) were screened via SVM. Their diagnostic- biomarker- immune- and clinical values were validated. Quercetin- luteolin- and baicalein were identified as core components. Molecular docking confirmed their strong affinities with predicted targets. These compounds modulated key targets and induced cytotoxicity in breast cancer cell lines in a similar way as TSGJ. This study reveals the main active components and targets of TSGJ against breast cancer- supporting its potential for breast cancer prevention and treatment.
Yi-Ming Wang- Chi-Yuan Wang- Kuo-Ying Liu- Yung-Hui Huang- Tai-Been Chen- Kon-Ning Chiu- Chih-Yu Liang- Nan-Han Lu,CNN-Based Cross-Modality Fusion for Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammography and Ultrasound,Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer globally and is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women; therefore- early- automated- and precise detection is essential. Most AI-based techniques for breast cancer detection are complex and have high computational costs. Hence- to overcome this challenge- we have presented the innovative LightweightUNet hybrid deep learning (DL) classifier for the accurate classification of breast cancer. The proposed model boasts a low computational cost due to its smaller number of layers in its architecture- and its adaptive nature stems from its use of depth-wise separable convolution. We have employed a multimodal approach to validate the model's performance- using 13-000 images from two distinct modalities: mammogram imaging (MGI) and ultrasound imaging (USI). We collected the multimodal imaging datasets from seven different sources- including the benchmark datasets DDSM- MIAS- INbreast- BrEaST- BUSI- Thammasat- and HMSS. Since the datasets are from various sources- we have resized them to the uniform size of 256 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 256 pixels and normalized them using the Box-Cox transformation technique. Since the USI dataset is smaller- we have applied the StyleGAN3 model to generate 10-000 synthetic ultrasound images. In this work- we have performed two separate experiments: the first on a real dataset without augmentation and the second on a real + GAN-augmented dataset using our proposed method. During the experiments- we used a 5-fold cross-validation method- and our proposed model obtained good results on the real dataset (87.16% precision- 86.87% recall- 86.84% F1-score- and 86.87% accuracy) without adding any extra data. Similarly- the second experiment provides better performance on the real + GAN-augmented dataset (96.36% precision- 96.35% recall- 96.35% F1-score- and 96.35% accuracy). This multimodal approach- which utilizes LightweightUNet- enhances the performance by 9.20% in precision- 9.48% in recall- 9.51% in F1-score- and a 9.48% increase in accuracy on the combined dataset. The LightweightUNet model we proposed works very well thanks to a creative network design- adding fake images to the data- and a multimodal training method. These results show that the model has a lot of potential for use in clinical settings.
Sahel Soghrati- Jaleh Varshosaz- Mahboubeh Rostami- Mina Mirian,Co-delivery of dasatinib and miR-30a by liposomes targeting neuropilin-1 receptors for triple-negative breast cancer therapy,As per the reports of the National Cancer Institution- breast cancer is impacting 13% of womenâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s lives. Breast cancer is ranked as the second major cause of death and requires an urgent diagnosis. This research on breast cancer combines machine learning and medical informatics to precisely diagnose breast cancer. A hybrid ensemble model is proposed in this research by utilizing characteristics of Artificial Neural Network and Deep Belief Network. The breast cancer Wisconsin dataset consisting of digital breast mass aspirate images is employed in this research to address the challenge of differentiating benign cases from malignant cases. The main aim is to manage the mutual prowess of individual models within the ensemble thus increasing the classification accuracy. Artificial Neural Network catches and shows the important features of the input data whereas Deep Belief Network is utilized for unsupervised pre-training to learn the conceptual features from raw data. The proposed model outperformed various machine learning techniques and shows an accuracy rate of 98.14%. So- the proposed hybrid ensemble framework shows effectiveness in the diagnosis of breast cancer- which is a significant advancement in the merging of machine learning and medical informatics. The view of magnifying classification accuracy holds enough potential to increase survival rates and patient care.
Meiying Yan- Dilin He- Yu Sun- Long Huang- Linli Cai- Chen Wang- Jincao Yao- Xiangyang Li- Hongping Song- Chen Yang,Comparative Analysis of Nomogram and Machine Learning Models for Predicting Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Early-Stage Breast Cancer: A Study on Clinically and Ultrasound-Negative Axillary Cases Across Two Centers.,Deep-learning-based breast cancer image diagnosis is currently a prominent and growingly popular area of research. Existing convolutional-neural-network-related methods mainly capture breast cancer image features based on spatial domain characteristics for classification. However- according to digital signal processing theory- texture images usually contain repeated patterns and structures- which appear as intense energy at specific frequencies in the frequency domain. Motivated by this- we make an attempt to explore a breast cancer histopathology classification application in the frequency domain and further propose a novel multi-branch spectral channel attention network- i.e.- the MbsCANet. It expands the interaction of frequency domain attention mechanisms from a multi-branch perspective via combining the lowest frequency features with selected high frequency information from two-dimensional discrete cosine transform- thus preventing the loss of phase information and gaining richer context information for classification. We thoroughly evaluate and analyze the MbsCANet on the publicly accessible BreakHis breast cancer histopathology dataset. It respectively achieves the optimal image-level and patient-level classification results of 99.01% and 98.87%- averagely outperforming the spatial-domain-dominated models by a large margin- and visualization results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the MbsCANet for this medical image application.
Aamir Mehmood- Rongpei Li- Aman Chandra Kaushik- Dong-Qing Wei,Comparative analysis of the genomic and expression profiles of ANLN and KDR as prognostic markers in breast Cancer,Cancers are getting pretty common these days and in that the second most common cancer in the world after lung cancer is breast cancer. The primary screening techniques for early diagnosis of cancerous nodules in women breast are Ultrasound- Mammography- and MRI analysis. However- accurately identifying and outlining the boundaries of tumor regions remains challenging due to their unpredictable shapes- random variations- and blurry outlines. Currently- the CAD based image analysis systems have gained huge attention in biomedical image processing systems along with Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods. The conventional machine learning methods suffer from accuracy related issues therefore deep learning-based schemes have been adopted. Specifically- UNet based approach is widely employed for biomedical image segmentation. This research focuses on development of a UNet based deep learning architecture for breast cancer image analysis and segmentation. The proposed model improves the segmentation accuracy by adding saliency model- channel and spatial attention model to consider the low- and high-level features. These modules help to achieve the clear boundary during segmentation. The performance of proposed model is evaluated by using publicly available mammogram dataset known as DDSM dataset.
He Dou- Tian Gao- Zhaoting Li- Siyuan Jia- Danli Luo- Yuling Ba- Fucheng Li- Jianan Wang- Min Xiao,Comparison of clinical characteristics and pathologic complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women under 35 years and older women with breast cancer,In the USA over 1 million breast biopsies are performed annually. Approximately 9.6% diagnostic exams were given Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢4A- most of which are 4A/4B. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) may improve biopsy outcome prediction for this subpopulation- but machine learning-based analysis of CEM is largely unexplored. We aim to develop a machine learning-based analysis of CEM using computer-extracted radiomics and radiologist-assessed descriptors to predict breast biopsy outcomes of BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions. This HIPPA-compliant- IRB-approved study included women in a single institution who had BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions and underwent CEM imaging prior to biopsy. Logistic regression models were built to predict biopsy outcomes using radiomics features and four radiologist-assessed qualitative descriptors. A cohort of 201 patients was used for model development/training- and an independent group of 86 patients were used as an internal test set. AUC was used to measure model's performance. Positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed on subgroups of BI-RADS 4A or 4B lesions. Model AUC was 0.90 for radiomics- 0.81 for clinical descriptors and 0.88 for their combination. On patients with an initial BI-RADS 4A or 4B scores- model combining radiomics and clinical descriptors of pre-biopsy CEM increased PPV3 to 18% from the radiologist's 6% for 4A patients- and to 25% from the radiologist's 17% for 4B patients. Machine learning models combining radiomics features and clinical descriptors on CEM can predict breast biopsy outcomes on women with BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions.
Marika Franklin- Sophie Lewis- Andrea L Smith,Complexities in supportive care for people with metastatic breast cancer: a qualitative study,To validate the performance of Mirai- a mammography-based deep learning model- in predicting breast cancer risk over a 1-5-year period in Mexican women. This retrospective single-center study included mammograms in Mexican women who underwent screening mammography between January 2014 and December 2016. For women with consecutive mammograms during the study period- only the initial mammogram was included. Pathology and imaging follow-up served as the reference standard. Model performance in the entire dataset was evaluated- including the concordance index (C-Index) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Mirai's performance in terms of AUC was also evaluated between mammography systems (Hologic versus IMS). Clinical utility was evaluated by determining a cutoff point for Mirai's continuous risk index based on identifying the top 10% of patients in the high-risk category. Of 3110 patients (median age 52.6 years Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 8.9)- throughout the 5-year follow-up period- 3034 patients remained cancer-free- while 76 patients developed breast cancer. Mirai achieved a C-index of 0.63 (95% CI: 0.6-0.7) for the entire dataset. Mirai achieved a higher mean C-index in the Hologic subgroup (0.63 [95% CI: 0.5-0.7]) versus the IMS subgroup (0.55 [95% CI: 0.4-0.7]). With a Mirai index score > 0.029 (10% threshold) to identify high-risk individuals- the study revealed that individuals in the high-risk group had nearly three times the risk of developing breast cancer compared to those in the low-risk group. Mirai has a moderate performance in predicting future breast cancer among Mexican women. Prospective efforts should refine and apply the Mirai model- especially to minority populations and women aged between 30 and 40 years who are currently not targeted for routine screening. The applicability of AI models to non-White- minority populations remains understudied. The Mirai model is linked to future cancer events in Mexican women. Further research is needed to enhance model performance and establish usage guidelines.
Petru Manescu- Joseph Geradts- Delmiro Fernandez-Reyes,Computational Pathology Detection of Hypoxia-Induced Morphologic Changes in Breast Cancer,Breast cancer is a significant global health concern- and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Mammography is widely used but has limitations- particularly for younger women with denser breasts. These include reduced sensitivity- false positives- and radiation risks. This highlights the need for alternative screening methods. In this study- we assess the performance of SAFE (Scan and Find Early)- a novel microwave imaging device- in detecting breast cancer in a larger patient cohort. Unlike previous studies that predominantly relied on cross-validation- this study employs a more reliable- independent evaluation methodology to enhance generalizability. We developed an XGBoost model to classify breast cancer cases into positive (malignant) and negative (benign or healthy) groups. The model was analyzed with respect to key factors such as breast size- density- age- tumor size- and histopathological findings. This approach provides a better understanding of how these factors influence the model's performance- using an independent evaluation methodology for increased reliability. Our results demonstrate that SAFE exhibits high sensitivity- particularly in dense breasts (91%) and younger patients (83%)- suggesting its potential as a supplemental screening tool. Additionally- the system shows high detection accuracy for both small (<2 cm) and larger lesions- proving effective in early cancer detection. This study reinforces the potential of SAFE to complement existing screening methods- particularly for patients with dense breasts- where mammography's sensitivity is reduced. The promising results warrant further research to solidify SAFE's clinical application as an alternative screening tool for breast cancer detection.

However- all models faced challenges in classifying instances of class 0 accurately. The Naive Bayes algorithm was compared with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Future research will enhance prediction models with new methods and address the challenge of accurately identifying instances of class 0.

We trained and developed a deep learning model using a total of 36-995 serial mammographic examinations from 21-438 women (cancer-enriched mammograms- 17.5%). To determine the feasibility of the AI prediction model- mammograms and detailed clinical information were collected. C-indices and area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for 1-5-year outcomes were obtained. We compared the AUCs of our AI prediction model- Mirai- and clinical statistical risk models- including the Tyrer-Cuzick (TC) model and Gail model- using DeLong's test. A total of 16-894 mammograms were independently collected for external validation- of which 4002 were followed by a cancer diagnosis within 5 years. Our AI prediction model obtained a C-index of 0.76- with AUCs of 0.90- 0.84- 0.81- 0.78- and 0.81- to predict the 1-5-year risks. Our AI prediction model showed significantly higher AUCs than those of the TC model (AUC: 0.57; p < 0.001) and Gail model (AUC: 0.52; p < 0.001)- and achieved similar performance to Mirai. The deep learning AI model using mammograms and AI-powered imaging biomarkers has substantial potential to advance accurate breast cancer risk prediction.

Krause,Contemporary Analysis of Reexcision and Conversion to Mastectomy Rates and Associated Healthcare Costs for Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Surgery,We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted- and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression- independent clinical predictors- DL-Score- and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect- and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical- radiomics (Rad-Score)- and deep learning (DL-Score) models- the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895-0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838-0.973) in the validation set. Moreover- decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC- which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.

Currently- it affects more than 10% of women globally. Therefore- researchers have recently redirected their endeavors toward detecting BC at an early stage- recognizing its substantial impact on survival rates- and acknowledging its immense potential for providing effective cancer treatments at this early diagnosed disease stage. The utilization of biomarker-based diagnostic techniques significantly contributes to the advancement of early detection and precision. A wide range of biomarkers is linked to every newly diagnosed BC case. Traditionally- breast cancer was diagnosed using a variety of techniques such as mammography- molecular imaging- and ultrasonography. These techniques had several drawbacks- drawing the attention of many scientists to developing new methods and strategies. Among these strategies- electrochemical biosensors have proven to be excellent alternatives to more complex and traditional detection strategies in terms of performance- accuracy- robustness- and a tremendous range of applications. In this review- the use of conventional methods for detecting BC as well as their challenges and shortcomings have been stated. Moreover- a deep discussion was given to the newly developed nanocomposite-based electrochemical bio-sensing approaches that have been exploited for the effective detection and quantification of breast cancer biomarkers.

This study aimed to apply machine learning techniques to recognize the most important breast cancer risk factors. This case-control study included women aged 17-75 years who were referred to medical centers affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Science between March 21- 2015- and March 19- 2016. The study had two datasets: one with 516 samples (258 cases and 258 controls) and another with 606 samples (303 cases and 303 controls). Written informed consent has been observed. Decision Tree (DT)- Random Forest (RF)- Logistic Regression (LR)- and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied using R studio software. Regarding the DT and RF- the most important features that impact breast cancer were family cancer- individual history of breast cancer- biopsy sampling- rarely consumption of a dairy- fruit- and vegetable meal- while in PCA and LR these features including family cancer- pregnancy number- pregnancy tendency- abortion- first menstruation- the age of first childbirth and childbirth number. Machine learning algorithms can be used to extract the most important factors in the diagnosis of breast cancer in developing countries such as Iran.

Methods: We customize a DenseNet-based model on our exclusive dual-view breast ultrasound dataset to enhance the model's ability to differentiate between malignant and benign masses. Various assembly strategies are designed to integrate the dual views into the model input- contrasting with the use of single views alone- with a goal to maximize performance. Subsequently- we compare the model against the radiologist and quantify the improvement in key performance metrics. We further assess how the radiologist's diagnostic accuracy is enhanced with the assistance of the model. Results: Our experiments consistently found that optimal outcomes were achieved by using a channel-wise stacking approach incorporating both views- with one duplicated as the third channel. This configuration resulted in remarkable model performance with an area underthe receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.9754- specificity of 0.96- and sensitivity of 0.9263- outperforming the radiologist by 50% in specificity. With the model's guidance- the radiologist's performance improved across key metrics: accuracy by 17%- precision by 26%- and specificity by 29%. Conclusions: Our customized model- withan optimal configuration for dual-view image input- surpassed both radiologists and existing model results in the literature. Integrating the model as a standalone tool or assistive aid for radiologists can greatly enhance specificity- reduce false positives- thereby minimizing unnecessary biopsies and alleviating radiologists' workload.
Xiao Zhao- Yue-Han Dong- Li-Yu Xu- Yan-Yan Shen- Gang Qin- Zheng-Bo Zhang,Deep bone oncology Diagnostics: Computed tomography based Machine learning for detection of bone tumors from breast cancer metastasis,Tumor bed (TB) is the residual cavity of resected tumor after surgery. Delineating TB from CT is crucial in generating clinical target volume for radiotherapy. Due to multiple surgical effects and low image contrast- segmenting TB from soft tissue is challenging. In clinical practice- titanium clips were used as marks to guide the searching of TB. However- this information is limited and may cause large error. To provide more prior location information- the tumor regions on both pre-operative and post-operative CTs are both used by the deep learning model in segmenting TB from surrounding tissues. For breast cancer patient after surgery and going to be treated by radiotherapy- it is important to delineate the target volume for treatment planning. In clinical practice- the target volume is usually generated from TB by adding a certain margin. Therefore- it is crucial to identify TB from soft tissue. To facilitate this process- a deep learning model is developed to segment TB from CT with the guidance of prior tumor location. Initially- the tumor contour on the pre-operative CT is delineated by physician for surgical planning purpose. Then this contour is transformed to the post-operative CT via the deformable image registration between paired pre-operative and post-operative CTs. The original and transformed tumor regions are both used as inputs for predicting the possible region of TB by the deep-learning model. Compared to the one without prior tumor contour information- the dice similarity coefficient of the deep-learning model with the prior tumor contour information is improved significantly (0.812 vs. 0.520- Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.001). Compared to the traditional gray-level thresholding method- the dice similarity coefficient of the deep-learning model with the prior tumor contour information is improved significantly (0.812 vs.0.633- Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.0005). The prior tumor contours on both pre-operative and post-operative CTs provide valuable information in searching for the precise location of TB on post-operative CT. The proposed method provided a feasible way to assist auto-segmentation of TB in treatment planning of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery.

In this study- the authors propose the use of radiomic technology and three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology to develop an unsupervised learning model for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer (BC)- aiming to provide a new method for clinical axillary lymph node assessment in patients with this disease. In this study- we retrospectively analyzed the data of 350 patients with invasive BC who underwent lung-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and axillary lymph node dissection surgery at the Department of Breast Surgery of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The authors used 3D visualization technology to create a 3D atlas of ALNs and identified the region of interest for the lymph nodes. Radiomic features were subsequently extracted and selected- and a prediction model for ALNs was constructed using the K-means unsupervised algorithm. To validate the model- the authors prospectively collected data from 128 BC patients who were clinically evaluated as negative at our center. Using 3D visualization technology- we extracted and selected a total of 36 CT radiomics features. The unsupervised learning model categorized 1737 unlabeled lymph nodes into two groups- and the analysis of the radiomic features between these groups indicated potential differences in lymph node status. Further validation with 1397 labeled lymph nodes demonstrated that the model had good predictive ability for axillary lymph node status- with an area under the curve of 0.847 (0.825-0.869). Additionally- the model's excellent predictive performance was confirmed in the 128 axillary clinical assessment negative cohort (cN0) and the 350 clinical assessment positive (cN+) cohort- for which the correct classification rates were 86.72 and 87.43%- respectively- which were significantly greater than those of clinical assessment methods. The authors created an unsupervised learning model that accurately predicts the status of ALNs. This approach offers a novel solution for the precise assessment of ALNs in patients with BC.

However- the extraction of key information from complex medical images and the attainment of high-precision classification present a significant challenge. In the field of signal processing- texture-rich images typically exhibit periodic patterns and structures- which are manifested as significant energy concentrations at specific frequencies in the frequency domain. Given the above considerations- this study is designed to explore the application of frequency domain analysis in BC histopathological classification. This study proposes the dual-branch adaptive frequency domain fusion network (AFFNet)- designed to enable each branch to specialize in distinct frequency domain features of pathological images. Additionally- two different frequency domain approaches- namely Multi-Spectral Channel Attention (MSCA) and Fourier Filtering Enhancement Operator (FFEO)- are employed to enhance the texture features of pathological images and minimize information loss. Moreover- the contributions of the two branches at different stages are dynamically adjusted by a frequency-domain-adaptive fusion strategy to accommodate the complexity and multi-scale features of pathological images. The experimental results- based on two public BC histopathological image datasets- corroborate the idea that AFFNet outperforms 10 state-of-the-art image classification methods- underscoring its effectiveness and superiority in this domain.
Chen Cheng- Yan Wang- Jine Zhao- Di Wu- Honge Li- Hongyan Zhao,Deep Learning and Radiomics in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Predicting Long-Term Prognosis and Clinical Outcomes,INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound in conjunction with mammography imaging- plays a vital role in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However- speckle noise affects medical ultrasound images and degrades visual radiological interpretation. Speckle carries information about the interactions of the ultrasound pulse with the tissue microstructure- which generally causes several difficulties in identifying malignant and benign regions. The application of deep learning in image denoising has gained more attention in recent years. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this work is to reduce speckle noise while preserving features and details in breast ultrasound images using GAN models. METHODS: We proposed two GANs models (Conditional GAN and Wasserstein GAN) for speckle-denoising public breast ultrasound databases: BUSI- DATASET A- AND UDIAT (DATASET B). The Conditional GAN model was trained using the Unet architecture- and the WGAN model was trained using the Resnet architecture. The image quality results in both algorithms were measured by Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR- 35â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®40 dB) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM- 0.90â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.95) standard values. RESULTS: The experimental analysis clearly shows that the Conditional GAN model achieves better breast ultrasound despeckling performance over the datasets in terms of PSNR = 38.18 dB and SSIM = 0.96 with respect to the WGAN model (PSNR = 33.0068 dB and SSIM = 0.91) on the small ultrasound training datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The observed performance differences between CGAN and WGAN will help to better implement new tasks in a computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) system. In future work- these data can be used as CAD input training for image classification- reducing overfitting and improving the performance and accuracy of deep convolutional algorithms.

Yao,Deep learning combining mammography and ultrasound images to predict the malignancy of BI-RADS US 4A lesions in women with dense breasts: a diagnostic study,Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of disease among women. It has become one of the foremost causes of death among women globally. Early detection plays a significant role in administering personalized treatment and improving patient outcomes. Mammography procedures are often used to detect early-stage cancer cells. This traditional method of mammography while valuable has limitations of potential for false positives and negatives- patient discomfort- and radiation exposure. Therefore- there is a probe for more accurate techniques required in detecting breast cancer- leading to exploring the potential of machine learning in the classification of diagnostic images due to its efficiency and accuracy. This study conducted a comparative analysis of pre-trained CNNs (ResNet50 and VGG16) and Vision Transformers (ViT-Base and SWIN Transformer) with the inclusion of ViT-Base trained from scratch model architectures to effectively classify breast cancer mammographic images into benign and malignant cases. The Swin transformer exhibits superior performance with 99.8% accuracy and a precision of 99.8%. These findings demonstrate the efficiency of deep learning to accurately classify breast cancer mammographic images for the diagnosis of breast cancer- leading to improvement in patient outcomes.

A retrospective de-identified dataset was used to collect the gist of breast cancer (i.e.- gist scores) from 13 readers interpreting 1100 screening craniocaudal mammograms (659 current â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´normalâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ cancer-free images- and 441 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´priorâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ no visible signs of cancer images acquired two years before current cancer mammograms). The collected gist scores from all readers were averaged to eliminate the noise of the gist signal- giving one gist score per image. The images were grouped into high- and low-gist based on the 75th and 25th percentiles of the images containing the highest and lowest gist scores- respectively. A set of 130 handcrafted global radiomic features per image were extracted and used to construct two machine learning random forest classifiers: 1). Normal and 2). Prior based on the corresponding features computed from the â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´normalâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ and â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´priorâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ images- for distinguishing high- from low-gist images. The classifiers were trained and validated using the 10-fold cross-validation approach and their performances were measured by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The Normal and Prior classifiers resulted in AUCs of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.85) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.80-0.87) respectively- suggesting that the global mammographic radiomic features can predict the gist of breast cancer on a screening mammogram.
Tae Yong Park- Lyo Min Kwon- Jini Hyeon- Bum-Joo Cho- Bum Jun Kim,Deep Learning Prediction of Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Breast Cancer Patients Using Clinical Implication-Applied Preprocessed CT Images,The stromal microenvironment (SME) is integral to breast cancer (BC) biology- impacting metastatic proclivity and treatment response. Emerging data indicate that host factors may impact the SME- but the relationship between pre-diagnostic host factors and SME phenotype remains poorly characterized- particularly among women of African ancestry. We conducted a case-only analysis involving 792 BC patients (17-84 years) from the Ghana Breast Health Study (GBHS). High-accuracy machine-learning algorithms were applied to standard H&E-stained images to characterize SME phenotypes (including percent tumor-associated connective tissue stroma- Ta-CTS (%)- and tumor-associated stromal cellular density- Ta-SCD (%)). Associations between pre-diagnostic host factors and SME phenotypes were assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Decreasing Ta-CTS and increasing Ta-SCD were associated with aggressive- mostly high-grade tumors (p-value<0.001). Several pre-diagnostic host factors were associated with Ta-SCD independently of tumor characteristics. Compared with nulliparous women- parous women had higher levels of Ta-SCD [mean (standard deviation- SD) = 31.3% (7.6%) vs. 28.9% (7.1%); p-value=0.01]. Similarly- women with a positive family history of breast cancer had higher levels of Ta-SCD than those without family history [mean (SD) = 33.0% (7.5%)] vs. 30.9% (7.6%); p-value=0.03]. Conversely- increasing body size was associated with decreasing Ta-SCD [mean (SD) = 32.0% (7.4%)- 31.3% (7.3%)- and 29.0% (8.0%) for slight- average- and large body sizes- respectively- p-value=0.005]. Epidemiological risk factors were associated with varying degrees of stromal cellularity in tumors- independently of clinicopathological characteristics. The findings raise the possibility that epidemiological risk factors may partly influence tumor biology via the SME.
Andrew Davidson- Arthur Morley-Bunker- George Wiggins- Logan Walker- Gavin Harris- Ramakrishnan Mukundan- kConFab Investigators,Deep Learning Segmentation of Chromogenic Dye RNAscope From Breast Cancer Tissue,Breast cancer- a leading cause of mortality among women- has been recognized as requiring improved diagnostic methods. Exosome proteins- found in small extracellular vesicles- have emerged as a promising solution- reflecting the state of their cell of origin and playing key roles in cancer progression. This review examines their potential in breast cancer diagnosis- discussing advanced isolation and characterization techniques such as ultracentrifugation and microfluidic-based approaches. Various detection methods-including electrochemical- nano-based- optical- and machine learning platforms-were evaluated for their high sensitivity- specificity- and non-invasive capabilities. Electrochemical methods were used to identify unique protein signatures for rapid- cost-effective diagnosis- while machine learning enhanced the classification of exosome proteins. Nano-based techniques leveraged nanomaterials to detect low-abundance proteins- and optical methods offered real-time- label-free monitoring. Despite their promise- challenges in standardizing protocols and integrating these diagnostics into clinical practice remain. Future directions include technological advancements- personalized medicine- and exploring the therapeutic potential of exosome proteins.
Guangliang Yang- Haiqi Chen- Jinchao Yue,Deep learning to optimize radiotherapy decisions for elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer: a novel approach for personalized treatment,Accurately and swiftly segmenting breast tumors is significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasound imaging stands as one of the widely employed methods in clinical practice. However- due to challenges such as low contrast- blurred boundaries- and prevalent shadows in ultrasound images- tumor segmentation remains a daunting task. In this study- we propose BCT-Net- a network amalgamating CNN and transformer components for breast tumor segmentation. BCT-Net integrates a dual-level attention mechanism to capture more features and redefines the skip connection module. We introduce the utilization of a classification task as an auxiliary task to impart additional semantic information to the segmentation network- employing supervised contrastive learning. A hybrid objective loss function is proposed- which combines pixel-wise cross-entropy- binary cross-entropy- and supervised contrastive learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that BCT-Net achieves high precision- with Pre and DSC indices of 86.12% and 88.70%- respectively. Experiments conducted on the BUSI dataset of breast ultrasound images manifest that this approach exhibits high accuracy in breast tumor segmentation.
Xiangyu Lu- Yingying Jia- Hongjuan Zhang- Ruichao Wu- Wuyuan Zhao- Zihuan Yao- Fang Nie- Yide Ma,Deep learning-based and BI-RADS guided radiomics model for automatic tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes evaluation in breast cancer,The status of axillary lymph nodes (ALN) plays a critical role in the management of patients with breast cancer. It is an urgent demand to develop highly accurate- non-invasive methods for predicting ALN status. To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound radiofrequency (URF) time-series parameters- in combination with clinical data- in predicting ALN metastasis in patients with breast cancer. We prospectively gathered clinicopathologic and ultrasonic data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Various machine-learning (ML) models were developed using all available features to determine the most efficient diagnostic model. Subsequently- distinct prediction models were created using the optimal ML model- and their diagnostic performances were evaluated and compared. The study encompassed 240 patients- of whom 88 had lymph node metastases. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was used to split the entire dataset into training and testing subsets.

Methodologically- the fusion of multimodal ultrasound images often encounters challenges such as misalignment- limited utilization of complementary information- poor interpretability in feature fusion- and imbalances in sample categories. To solve these problems- we propose a feature alignment mutual attention fusion method (FAMF-Net)- which consists of a region awareness alignment (RAA) block- a mutual attention fusion (MAF) block- and a reinforcement learning-based dynamic optimization strategy(RDO). Specifically- RAA achieves region awareness through class activation mapping and performs translation transformation to achieve feature alignment. When MAF utilizes a mutual attention mechanism for feature interaction fusion- it mines edge and color features separately in B-mode and shear wave elastography images- enhancing the complementarity of features and improving interpretability. Finally- RDO uses the distribution of samples and prediction probabilities during training as the state of reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize the weights of the loss function- thereby solving the problem of class imbalance. The experimental results based on our clinically obtained dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our code will be available at: https://github.com/Magnety/Multi_modal_Image.

This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of CADe systems in breast MRI- focusing on the technical details of pipelines and segmentation models including classical intensity-based methods- supervised and unsupervised machine learning (ML) approaches- and the latest deep learning (DL) architectures. It highlights recent advancements from traditional algorithms to sophisticated DL models such as U-Nets- emphasizing CADe implementation of multi-parametric MRI acquisitions. Despite these advancements- CADe systems face challenges like variable false-positive and negative rates- complexity in interpreting extensive imaging data- variability in system performance- and lack of large-scale studies and multicentric models- limiting the generalizability and suitability for clinical implementation. Technical issues- including image artefacts and the need for reproducible and explainable detection algorithms- remain significant hurdles. Future directions emphasize developing more robust and generalizable algorithms- integrating explainable AI to improve transparency and trust among clinicians- developing multi-purpose AI systems- and incorporating large language models to enhance diagnostic reporting and patient management. Additionally- efforts to standardize and streamline MRI protocols aim to increase accessibility and reduce costs- optimizing the use of CADe systems in clinical practice.

S R Sannasi Chakravarthy- N Bharanidharan- V Vinoth Kumar- T R Mahesh- Mohammed S Alqahtani- Suresh Guluwadi,Deep transfer learning with fuzzy ensemble approach for the early detection of breast cancer,The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor tissue can offer valuable insights into TIME- but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultrahigh-resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However- few study pay attention to the quantitative estimation of various tumor infiltration immune cells from pathology images. In this paper- we integrated contrastive learning and weakly supervised learning to infer tumor-associated macrophages and potential immunotherapy benefit from whole slide images (WSIs) of H &E stained pathological sections. We split the high-resolution WSIs into tiles and then apply contrastive learning to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level- we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that the computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells- particularly the infiltration level of macrophages- as well as the immune subtypes and potential immunotherapy benefit. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision- establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology- thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images.
Vahab Khoshdel- Nasrin Abharian- Amir Attar- Joe LoVetri,Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Generating Tissue Type Breast Image Dataset,In medical imaging- the effective detection and classification of Breast Cancer (BC) is a current research important task because of the still existing difficulty to distinguish abnormalities from normal breast tissues due to their subtle appearance and ambiguous margins and distinguish abnormalities from the normal breast. Moreover- BC detection based on an automated detection model is needed- because manual diagnosis faces problems due to cost and shortage of skilled manpower- and also takes a very long time. Using deep learning and ensemble feature selection techniques- in this paper- a novel framework is introduced for classifying BC from histopathology images. The five primary steps of the suggested framework are as follows: 1) to make the largest original dataset and then deep learning model with data augmentation to improve the learning. 2) The best features are selected by an Ensemble Filter Feature selection Method (EFFM) which combines the best feature subsets to produce the final feature subsets. 3) Then the pruned Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model is utilized to extract the optimal features. 4) Finally- the classification is done through the Triplet Attention based Efficient Network (TAENet) classifier. The suggested model produces a 98% accuracy rate after being trained and tested on two different histopathology imaging datasets including images from four different data cohorts. Subsequently- the suggested strategy outperforms the conventional ones since the ensemble filter habitually acquires the best features- and experimental results demonstrate the importance of the proposed approach

Here- we present a method using a new model of a Q-TOF instrument equipped with a Zeno trap for intact glycopeptide identification and demonstrate its ability to analyze large-cohort glycoproteomes. From 124 clinical serum samples of breast cancer- noncancerous diseases- and nondisease controls- a total of 6901 unique site-specific glycans on 807 glycosites of proteins were detected. Much more differences of glycoproteome were observed in breast diseases than the proteome. By employing machine learning- 15 site-specific glycans were determined as potential glyco-signatures in detecting breast cancer. The results demonstrate that our method provides a powerful tool in glycoproteomic studies.
Hea Lim Choi- Su Min Jeong- Keun Hye Jeon- Bongseong Kim- Wonyoung Jung- Ansuk Jeong- Kyungdo Han- Dong Wook Shin,Depression risk among breast cancer survivors: a nationwide cohort study in South Korea,Photoacoustic tomography (PAT) has emerged as a promising imaging modality for breast cancer detection- offering unique advantages in visualizing tissue composition without ionizing radiation. However- limited-view scenarios in clinical settings present significant challenges for image reconstruction quality and computational efficiency. This paper introduces novel unrolled deep learning networks based on split Bregman total variation (SBTV) and relaxed basis pursuit alternating direction method of multipliers (rBP-ADMM) algorithms to address these challenges. Our approach combines transfer learning from full-view to limited-view scenarios with U-Net denoiser integration- achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction quality (MS-SSIM> 0.95) while reducing reconstruction time by 92% compared to traditional methods. The effectiveness of different sensor configurations is analyzed through restricted isometry property (RIP) analysis and coherence values- demonstrating that semicircular arrays achieve a RIP constant of 0.76 and coherence of 0.77- closely approximating full-view performance (RIP: 0.75- coherence: 0.78). These metrics validate the theoretical foundation for accurate sparse signal recovery in limited-view scenarios. Comprehensive evaluations across semicircular- concave- and convex sensor arrangements show that the proposed U-SBTV network consistently outperforms existing methods- particularly when combined with the U-Net denoiser. This advancement in limited-view PAT reconstruction brings the technology closer to practical clinical application- potentially improving early breast cancer detection capabilities.

Data from two medical centers were utilized- Clinical blood markers- ultrasound data- and breast biopsy pathological information were separately extracted and selected. Feature dimensionality reduction was performed using Spearman correlation and LASSO regression. Predictive models were constructed using LR and LightGBM machine learning algorithms and validated on internal and external validation sets. Feature correlation analysis was conducted for both models. The LR model achieved AUC values of 0.892- 0.816- and 0.817 for the training- internal validation- and external validation cohorts- respectively. The LightGBM model achieved AUC values of 0.971- 0.861- and 0.890 for the same cohorts- respectively. Clinical decision curve analysis showed a superior net benefit of the LightGBM model over the LR model in predicting distant metastasis in breast cancer. Key features identified included creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK-MB) and alpha-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase. This study developed an artificial intelligence model using clinical blood markers- ultrasound data- and pathological information to identify distant metastasis in breast cancer patients. The LightGBM model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy and clinical applicability- suggesting it as a promising tool for early diagnosis of distant metastasis in breast cancer.
Idan Kassis- Dror Lederman- Gal Ben-Arie- Maia Giladi Rosenthal- Ilan Shelef- Yaniv Zigel,Detection of breast cancer in digital breast tomosynthesis with vision transformers,Breast cancer remains a major public health concern- and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. Metabolomics offers the potential to develop non-invasive screening and diagnostic tools based on metabolic biomarkers. However- the inherent complexity of metabolomic datasets and the high dimensionality of biomarkers complicates the identification of diagnostically relevant features- with multiple studies demonstrating limited consensus on the specific metabolites involved. Unlike previous studies that rely on singular feature selection techniques such as Partial Least Square (PLS) or LASSO regression- this research combines supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods with random sampling strategies- offering a more robust and interpretable approach to feature selection. This study aimed to identify a parsimonious and robust set of biomarkers for breast cancer diagnosis using metabolomics data. Plasma samples from 185 breast cancer patients and 53 controls (from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network- USA) were analyzed. This study also overcomes the common issue of dataset imbalance by using propensity score matching (PSM)- which ensures reliable comparisons between cancer and control groups. We employed Univariate Naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes- L2-regularized Support Vector Classifier (SVC)- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)- and feature engineering techniques to refine and select the most informative features. Our best-performing feature set comprised 11 biomarkers- including 9 metabolites (SM(OH) C22:2- SM C18:0- C0- C3OH- C14:2OH- C16:2OH- LysoPC a C18:1- PC aa C36:0 and Asparagine)- a metabolite ratio (Kynurenine-to-Tryptophan)- and 1 demographic variable (Age)- achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 98%. These results demonstrate the potential for a robust- cost-effective- and non-invasive breast cancer screening and diagnostic tool- offering significant clinical value for early detection and personalized patient management.
Li Yang- Ling-Xia Song- Lin Zhang- Yan Yang- Yong-Mei Zhang,Determinants of Demoralization Syndrome and Social Support Among Patients with Breast Cancer: A Cross-Sectional Study,Various supervised deep learning techniques have been used to enhance microwave imaging for breast cancer detection- but such techniques require large amounts of labelled training data which remains a significant challenge. In this research- we addressed the scarcity of realistic numerical permittivity breast phantoms by developing a generative model. This model uses high-level annotations- including breast types defined by BI-RADS categories- to produce a large- labeled tissue-type breast image dataset. Our prototype model integrates a U-Net with a denoising diffusion probabilistic model to generate tissue-specific 2D sagittal cross-section images of the segmented breast. Initial results demonstrate the modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s proficiency in generating realistic images that closely resemble segmented MRI scans- with quantitative assessments through Frâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚Â¬Â¨Â¬Â©chet Inception Distance (FID) scores confirming their authenticity.

Prompt detection of breast cancer can impede its advancement to more advanced phases- thereby elevating the probability of favorable treatment consequences. Histopathological images are commonly used for breast cancer classification due to their detailed cellular information. Existing diagnostic approaches rely on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) which are limited to local context resulting in a lower classification accuracy. Therefore- we present a fusion model composed of a Vision Transformer (ViT) and custom Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) network with an attention mechanism for effectively classifying breast cancer from histopathological images. ViT enables the model to attain global features- while the ASPP network accommodates multiscale features. Fusing the features derived from the models resulted in a robust breast cancer classifier. With the help of five-stage image preprocessing technique- the proposed model achieved 100% accuracy in classifying breast cancer on the BreakHis dataset at 100X and 400X magnification factors. On 40X and 200X magnifications- the model achieved 99.25% and 98.26% classification accuracy respectively. With a commendable classification efficacy on histopathological images- the model can be considered a dependable option for proficient breast cancer classification.

There is a critical demand for a precise method to assess the axillary lymph node (ALN) status in these patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 160 BC patients undergoing NAT at Fujian Medical University Union Hospital. We analyzed baseline and two-cycle reassessment dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) images- extracting 3668 radiomic and 4096 deep learning features- and computing 1834 delta-radiomic and 2048 delta-deep learning features. Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM)- Support Vector Machine (SVM)- RandomForest- and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithms were employed to develop risk models and were evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation. Of the patients- 61 (38.13Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %) achieved ypN0 status post-NAT. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed molecular subtypes and Ki67 as pivotal predictors of achieving ypN0 post-NAT.

We chose to focus on the identification of pathologic complete response (pCR) in narrative pathology reports. This approach aims to contribute to the advancement of comprehensive reporting- health research- and public health surveillance- thereby enhancing patient care and breast cancer management strategies. The study utilized two analytical pipelines- developed with open-source LLMs within the healthcare system's computing environment. First- we extracted embeddings from pathology reports using 15 different transformer-based models and then employed logistic regression on these embeddings to classify the presence or absence of pCR. Secondly- we fine-tuned the Generative Pre-trained Transformer-2 (GPT-2) model by attaching a simple feed-forward neural network (FFNN) layer to improve the detection performance of pCR from pathology reports. In a cohort of 351 female breast cancer patients who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) and subsequent surgery between 2010 and 2017 in Calgary- the optimized method displayed a sensitivity of 95.3% (95%CI: 84.0-100.0%)- a positive predictive value of 90.9% (95%CI: 76.5-100.0%)- and an F1 score of 93.0% (95%CI: 83.7-100.0%). The results- achieved through diverse LLM integration- surpassed traditional machine learning models- underscoring the potential of LLMs in clinical pathology information extraction. The study successfully demonstrates the efficacy of LLMs in interpreting and processing digital pathology data- particularly for determining pCR in breast cancer patients post-NAC. The superior performance of LLM-based pipelines over traditional models highlights their significant potential in extracting and analyzing key clinical data from narrative reports. While promising- these findings highlight the need for future external validation to confirm the reliability and broader applicability of these methods.

A retrospective study was conducted on 167 patients. All patients underwent a breast mass biopsy for histopathological and Ki-67 analysis prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) treatment. Additionally- all patients underwent ultrasonography and MRI examinations prior to the biopsy. The recorded variables were Ki-67- apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values- Max Slope- time to peak (TTP)- signal enhancement ratio (SER)- early enhancement rate (EER)- time-signal intensity curve (TIC)- tumor maximum diameter- tumor margins and boundaries- aspect ratio- microcalcification- color Doppler flow imaging grading- resistance index (RI)- and axillary lymph node metastasis.

The dataset was randomly divided into a modeling group and a validation group following a 7:3 ratio- employing a predetermined random seed. The selection of variables was conducted using the random forest algorithm. Specifically- in the initial analysis- we trained a random forest model using all available variables. By evaluating the Gini importance scores of each variable- we identified those that contributed the most to predicting Ki-67 expression. The predictive model for Ki-67 expression was constructed using selected variables: Maximum Diameter- ADC value- SER value- Max Slope value- TTP value- and EER value. Within the validation group- the evaluation metrics demonstrated an Area under the curve of 0.961 with a 95% confidence interval ranging from 0.865 to 0.995. The model achieved a kappa score of 1.00- precision of 0.949- recall of 1- an F1 score of 0.974- sensitivity of 100%- specificity of 85.71%- a positive predictive value of 94.87%- and a negative predictive value of 100%.

Developing predictive models for TNBC treatment responses is crucial but challenging due to data scarcity and the reliance on cell line data- which limits clinical translational value. Leveraging omics data from clinical trials- particularly through auxiliary learning- offers a potential solution to enhance predictive accuracy and reduce data requirements. In this study- we propose a new approach utilizing deep auxiliary task reweighting learning methods to automatically reweight auxiliary tasks- thereby optimizing the performance of the primary task of predicting TNBC treatment responses. We benchmark various auxiliary learning methods- including ARML- AdaLoss- GradNorm- and OL AUX- against traditional supervised machine learning algorithms and single-task learning baselines. Our results characterize the performance of auxiliary learning across various contexts- including utilizing parallel treatment arms within a multi-arm clinical trial- leveraging treatment arms from different clinical trials- and integrating multiple arms with the same treatment regimens across separate clinical trials. The last scenario also provides an opportunity for validating prediction models on an independent dataset- demonstrating the superior performance of the auxiliary learning models in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) in TNBC patients treated with standardized combinational chemotherapy with Taxane- Anthracycline- and Cyclophosphamide (TAC).

Hui Liu- Linlin Ying- Xing Song- Xueping Xiang- Shumei Wei,Development of metastasis and survival prediction model of luminal and non-luminal breast cancer with weakly supervised learning based on pathomics,A standard treatment protocol for breast cancer entails administering neoadjuvant therapy followed by surgical removal of the tumor and surrounding tissue. Pathologists typically rely on cabinet X-ray radiographs- known as Faxitron- to examine the excised breast tissue and diagnose the extent of residual disease. However- accurately determining the location- size- and focality of residual cancer can be challenging- and incorrect assessments can lead to clinical consequences. The utilization of automated methods can improve the histopathology process- allowing pathologists to choose regions for sampling more effectively and precisely. Despite the recognized necessity- there are currently no such methods available. Training such automated detection models require accurate ground truth labels on ex-vivo radiology images- which can be acquired through registering Faxitron and histopathology images and mapping the extent of cancer from histopathology to x-ray images. This study introduces a deep learning-based image registration approach trained on mono-modal synthetic image pairs. The models were trained using data from 50 women who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and underwent surgery. The results demonstrate that our method is faster and yields significantly lower average landmark error ($2.1\pm1.96$ mm) over the state-of-the-art iterative ($4.43\pm4.1$ mm) and deep learning ($4.02\pm3.15$ mm) approaches. Improved performance of our approach in integrating radiology and pathology information facilitates generating large datasets- which allows training models for more accurate breast cancer detection.

TNBC represents about 15% to 20% of all breast cancers and is aggressive and highly malignant. Currently- TNBC diagnosis primarily depends on pathological examination- while treatment efficacy is assessed through imaging- biomarker detection- pathological evaluation- and clinical symptom improvement. Among these- biomarker detection and pathological assessments are invasive- time-intensive procedures that may be difficult for patients with severe comorbidities and high complication risks. Thus- there is an urgent need for new- supportive tools in TNBC diagnosis and treatment. Deep learning and radiomics techniques represent advanced machine learning methodologies and are also emerging outcomes in the medical-engineering field in recent years. They are extensions of conventional imaging diagnostic methods and have demonstrated tremendous potential in image segmentation- reconstruction- recognition- and classification. These techniques hold certain application prospects for the diagnosis of TNBC- assessment of treatment response- and long-term prognosis prediction. This article reviews recent progress in the application of deep learning- ultrasound- MRI- and radiomics for TNBC diagnosis and treatment- based on research from both domestic and international scholars.

The accuracy of diagnosis is also significantly influenced by the experience of pathologists. Many studies have been conducted on the correct diagnosis of breast cancer to help specialists and increase the accuracy of diagnosis. This study focuses on classifying breast cancer using deep learning models- including pre-trained VGG16- MobileNet- DenseNet201- and a custom-built Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)- with the final dense layer optimized via the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. The Breast Histopathology Images Dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the model- forming two datasets: one with 157-572 images at 50 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 50 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 3 (Experimental Study 1) and another with 1116 images resized to 224 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 224 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 3 (Experimental Study 2).

The highest success rate was obtained using the custom-built CNN model with an accuracy rate of 93.80% for experimental study 1. The MobileNet model yielded an accuracy of 95.54% for experimental study 2. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model exhibits promising- and superior classification accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods across varying image sizes and dataset volumes.
Adhari AlZaabi- Stephen Piccolo- Steven Graves- Marc Hansen,Differential Serum Peptidomics Reveal Multi-Marker Models That Predict Breast Cancer Progression,Breast cancer- as a malignant tumor disease- has maintained high incidence and mortality rates over the years. Ultrasonography is one of the primary methods for diagnosing early-stage breast cancer. However- correctly interpreting breast ultrasound images requires massive time from physicians with specialized knowledge and extensive experience. Recently- deep learning-based method have made significant advancements in breast tumor segmentation and classification due to their powerful fitting capabilities. However- most existing methods focus on performing one of these tasks separately- and often failing to effectively leverage information from specific tumor-related areas that hold considerable diagnostic value. In this study- we propose a multi-task network with local-global feature interaction and multiple tumoral region guidance for breast ultrasound-based tumor segmentation and classification. Specifically- we construct a dual-stream encoder- paralleling CNN and Transformer- to facilitate hierarchical interaction and fusion of local and global features. This architecture enables each stream to capitalize on the strengths of the other while preserving its unique characteristics. Moreover- we design a multi-tumoral region guidance module to explicitly learn long-range non-local dependencies within intra-tumoral and peri-tumoral regions from spatial domain- thus providing interpretable cues beneficial for classification. Experimental results on two breast ultrasound datasets show that our network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in tumor segmentation and classification tasks. Compared with the second-best competitive method- our network improves the diagnosis accuracy from 73.64% to 80.21% on a large external validation dataset- which demonstrates its superior generalization capability.

Alhussein,Discriminative Dictionary Learning Using Penalized Rank-1 Approximation for Breast Cancer Classification With Imbalanced Dataset,Analysis of histopathological images (HIs) is crucial for detecting breast cancer (BR). However- because they vary- it is still very difficult to extract well-designed elements. Deep learning (DL) is a recent development that is used to extract high-level features. However- DL techniques continue to confront several difficult problems- such as the need for sufficient training data for DL models- which reduces the classification findings. In this study- an ensemble deep transfer convolutional neural network is presented to address this problem. The pre-trained models (ResNet50 and MobileNet) are employed to extract high-level features by freezing the front layer parameters while fine-tuning the last layers. In the proposed ensemble framework- KNN- SVM- logistic regression and neural networks are used as base classifiers. The majority vote and product approaches are used to integrate the predictions of each separate classifier. In the benchmark BreaKHis dataset- the suggested ensemble model is compared to some current approaches. It demonstrates that while the ensemble model obtains a considerable accuracy of 97.72% for the multiclass classification test- it achieves an accuracy of 99.2% for the binary task.

Shihao Sun- Shuang Chen- Nan Wang- Zehao Hong- Yi Sun- Yijia Xu- Jiangrui Chi- Xinxing Wang- Lin Li,DNA methylation profiling deciphers three EMT subtypes with distinct prognoses and therapeutic vulnerabilities in breast cancer,Accurate preoperative identification of Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) low expression breast cancer (BC) is critical for clinical decision-making. Our aim was to use machine learning methods to develop and validate an ultrasound-based radiomics nomogram for predicting HER2-low expression in BC. In this retrospective study- 222 patients (108 HER2-0 expression and 114 HER2-low expression) with BC were included. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into a training cohort and a test cohort with a ratio of 8:2. The tumor region of interest was manually delineated from ultrasound image- and radiomics features were subsequently extracted. The features underwent dimension reduction using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm- and rad-score were calculated. Five machine learning algorithms were applied for training- and the algorithm demonstrating the best performance was selected to construct a radiomics (USR) model. Clinical risk factors were integrated with rad-score to construct the prediction model- and a nomogram was plotted. The performance of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis. A total of 480 radiomics features were extracted- out of which 11 were screened out. The majority of the extracted features were wavelet features. Subsequently- the USR model was established- and rad-scores were computed. The nomogram- incorporating rad-score- tumor shape- border- and microcalcification- achieved the best performance in both the training cohort (AUC 0.89; 95%CI 0.836-0.936) and the test cohort (AUC 0.84; 95%CI 0.722-0.958)- outperforming both the USR model and clinical model. The calibration curves showed satisfactory consistency- and DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram. The nomogram model based on ultrasound radiomics exhibited high prediction value for HER2-low BC.

EL Berry- Rania Sobhy El gendy- Rehab Omar Taman- Hemat Mostafa Amer,Effect of Mindfulness Based Intervention on Alopecia Distress- Body Image Changes and Health Related Quality of Life among Women with Breast Cancer,Machine learning has emerged as a promising method for predicting breast cancer using quantum computation techniques. Quantum machine learning algorithms- such as quantum support vector machines (QSVMs)- are demonstrating superior efficiency and economy in tackling complex problems compared to traditional machine learning methods. When compared with classical support vector machine- the quantum machine produces remarkably accurate results. The suggested quantum SVM model in this study effectively resolved the binary classification problem for diagnosing malignant breast cancer. This work introduces an enhanced approach to breast cancer diagnosis by integrating QSVM with elitist nonâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ‘Â¢dominated sorting genetic optimization (ENSGA)- leveraging the strengths of both techniques to achieve more accurate and efficient classification results. ENSGA plays a crucial role in optimising QSVM parameters- ensuring that the model attains the best possible classification accuracy while considering multiple objectives simultaneously. Moreover- the quantum kernel estimation method demonstrated exceptional performance by achieving high accuracy within an impressive execution time of 0.14 in the IBM QSVM simulator. The seamless integration of quantum computation techniques with optimisation strategies such as ENSGA highlights the potential of quantum machine learning in revolutionising the field of healthcare- particularly in the domain of breast cancer diagnosis.
Meenakshi Devi P- Muna A- Yasser Ali- Sumanth V,Effective BCDNet-based breast cancer classification model using hybrid deep learning with VGG16-based optimal feature extraction,The diagnosis of malignant or benign breast cancer tumors from histopathological images is challenging due to human error- which may lead to the patient undergoing additional- often painful- procedures to collect new data. Utilizing a supervised- pre-trained ResNet-50 model as a second opinion for doctors can help eliminate the need for repeated procedures. One main challenge faced by doctors and machine learning models is image blurriness.

Robert D Melara- James C Root- Jay A Edelman- Maria Camilla Estelle- Isabella Mohr- Tim A Ahles,Effects of Breast Cancer Treatment on Neural Noise: a Longitudinal Design,Breast cancer is a major health concern worldwide. Mammography- a cost-effective and accurate tool- is crucial in combating this issue. However- low contrast- noise- and artifacts can limit the diagnostic capabilities of radiologists. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems have been developed to overcome these challenges- with the accurate outlining of the breast being a critical step for further analysis. This study introduces the SAM-breast model- an adaptation of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for segmenting the breast region in mammograms. This method enhances the delineation of the breast and the exclusion of the pectoral muscle in both medio lateral-oblique (MLO) and cranio-caudal (CC) views. We trained the models using a large- multi-center proprietary dataset of 2492 mammograms. The proposed SAM-breast model achieved the highest overall Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 99.22% Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 1.13 and Intersection over Union (IoU) 98.48% Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 2.10 over independent test images from five different datasets (two proprietary and three publicly available). The results are consistent across the different datasets- regardless of the vendor or image resolution. Compared with other baseline and deep learning-based methods- the proposed method exhibits enhanced performance. The SAM-breast model demonstrates the power of the SAM to adapt when it is tailored to specific tasks- in this case- the delineation of the breast in mammograms.

Jones,Effects of plant-based diet (PBD) and exercise therapy (Ex) on weight and body composition in patients with primary hormone receptor (HR) positive breast cancer: A phase 2 randomized controlled trial.,Breast cancer (BC) is the leading cause of mortality among women across the world. Earlier screening of BC can significantly reduce the mortality rate and assist the diagnostic process to increase the survival rate. Researchers employ deep learning (DL) techniques to detect BC using mammogram images. However- these techniques are resource-intensive- leading to implementation complexities in real-life environments. The performance of convolutional neural network (CNN) models depends on the quality of mammogram images. Thus- this study aimed to build a model to detect BC using a DL technique. Image preprocessing techniques were used to enhance image quality. The authors developed a CNN model using the EfficientNet B7 modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s weights to extract the image features. Multi-class classification of BC images was performed using the LightGBM model. The Optuna algorithm was used to fine-tune LightGBM for image classification. In addition- a quantization-aware training (QAT) strategy was followed to implement the proposed model in a resource-constrained environment. The authors generalized the proposed model using the CBIS-DDSM and CMMD datasets. Additionally- they combined these two datasets to ensure the modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s generalizability to diverse images. The experimental findings revealed that the suggested BC detection model produced a promising result. The proposed BC detection model obtained an accuracy of 99.4%- 99.9%- and 97.0%- and Kappa (K) values of 96.9%- 96.9%- and 94.1% in the CBIS-DDSM- CMMD- and combined datasets. The recommended model streamlined the BC detection process in order to achieve an exceptional outcome. It can be deployed in a real-life environment to support physicians in making effective decisions. Graph convolutional networks can be used to improve the performance of the proposed model.

The primary aim was to find the best combination of preprocessing algorithms to enable more precise classification and interpretation of mammography images because the selected preprocessing algorithms significantly impact the effectiveness of later classification and segmentation processes. The study utilised the mini-MIAS database of mammography images and examined the impact of applying various preprocessing method combinations to differentiate between malignant and benign breast lesions. The preprocessing steps included removing label information and pectoral muscle- followed by applying algorithms such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalisation (CLAHE)- unsharp masking (USM)- and median filtering (MF) to enhance image resolution and visibility. After preprocessing- a k-means clustering technique was used to extract potentially suspicious regions- and features were then extracted from these regions of interest (ROIs). The extracted feature datasets were classified using various machine learning algorithms- including artificial neural networks- random forest- and support vector machines. The findings showed that the combination of CLAHE- USM- and MF preprocessing algorithms resulted in the highest classification performance- outperforming the use of CLAHE alone. The integration of advanced preprocessing techniques with machine learning significantly enhances the accuracy of mammography analysis- facilitating more precise differentiation between malignant and benign breast lesions.

The efficient isolation and analysis of EVs for early cancer diagnosis and prognosis have gained significant attention. In this study- for the first time- a rapid and visually detectable method termed freeze-thaw-induced floating patterns of gold nanoparticles (FTFPA) is proposed- which surpasses current state-of-the-art technologies by achieving a 100 fold improvement in the limit of detection of EVs. Notably- it allows for multi-dimensional visualizations of EVs through site-specific oligonucleotide incorporation. This capability empowers FTFPA to accurately identify EVs derived from subtypes of breast cancers with artificial intelligence algorithms. Intriguingly- learning the freezing-thawing-microstructures of EVs with a random forest algorithm is not only able to distinguish their original cell lines (with an accuracy of 95.56%)- but also succeed in processing clinical samples (n = 156) to identify EVs by their healthy donors- breast lump and breast cancer subtypes (Luminal A- Triple-negative breast cancer- and Luminal B) with an accuracy of 83.33%. Therefore- this AI-empowered micro-visualization method establishes a rapid and precise point-of-care platform that is applicable to both fundamental research and clinical settings.

From May to December 2020- patients with BI-RADS 4 lesions from Centre 1 and Centre 2 were retrospectively enrolled and divided into a training set (Centre 1) and an independent test set (Centre 2). All included patients underwent an ABVS examination within one week before the biopsy. A two-stage DL framework consisting of an automatic segmentation module and an automatic classification module was developed. The preprocessed ABVS images were input into the segmentation module for BI-RADS 4 lesion segmentation. The classification model was constructed to extract features and output the probability of malignancy. The diagnostic performances among different ABVS views (axial- sagittal- coronal- and multi-view) and DL architectures (Inception-v3- ResNet 50- and MobileNet) were compared. A total of 251 BI-RADS 4 lesions from 216 patients were included (178 in the training set and 73 in the independent test set). The average Dice coefficient- precision- and recall of the segmentation module in the test set were 0.817 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.142- 0.903 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.183- and 0.886 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.187- respectively. The DL model based on multiview ABVS images and Inception-v3 achieved the best performance- with an AUC- sensitivity- specificity- PPV- and NPV of 0.949 (95% CI: 0.945-0.953)- 82.14%- 95.56%- 92.00%- and 89.58%- respectively- in the test set. The developed multiview DL model enables automatic segmentation and classification of BI-RADS 4 lesions in ABVS images.

Purpose To compare workload and screening performance for two cohorts of women who underwent screening before and after AI system implementation. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 50-69-year-old women who underwent biennial mammography screening in the Capital Region of Denmark. Before AI system implementation (October 1- 2020- to November 17- 2021)- all screenings involved double reading. For screenings conducted after AI system implementation (November 18- 2021- to October 17- 2022)- likely normal screenings (AI examination score â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼5 before May 3- 2022- or â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼7 on or after May 3- 2022) were single read by one of 19 senior full-time breast radiologists. The remaining screenings were read by two radiologists with AI-assisted decision support. Biopsy and surgical outcomes were retrieved between October 1- 2020- and April 15- 2023- ensuring at least 180 days of follow-up. Screening metrics were compared using the â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬âˆž2 test. Reading workload reduction was measured as saved screening reads.

Zi-Han Yu- Yu-Ting Hong- Chen-Pin Chou,Enhancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis: A Nomogram Model Integrating AI Ultrasound and Clinical Factors,Axillary lymph node (ALN) status is a crucial prognostic indicator for breast cancer metastasis- with manual interpretation of whole slide images (WSIs) being the current standard practice. However- this method is subjective and time-consuming. Recent advancements in deep learning-based methods for medical image analysis have shown promise in improving clinical diagnosis. This study aims to leverage these technological advancements to develop a deep learning model based on features extracted from primary tumor biopsies for preoperatively identifying ALN metastasis in early-stage breast cancer patients with negative nodes. We present DLCNBC-SA- a deep learning-based network specifically tailored for core needle biopsy and clinical data feature extraction- which integrates a self-attention mechanism (CNBC-SA). The proposed model consists of a feature extractor based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and an improved self-attention mechanism module- which can preserve the independence of features in WSIs for analysis and enhancement to provide rich feature representation. To validate the performance of the proposed model- we conducted comparative experiments and ablation studies using publicly available datasets- and verification was performed through quantitative analysis. The comparative experiment illustrates the superior performance of the proposed model in the task of binary classification of ALNs- as compared to alternative methods. Our method achieved outstanding performance [area under the curve (AUC): 0.882] in this task- significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method on the same dataset (AUC: 0.862). The ablation experiment reveals that incorporating RandomRotation data augmentation technology and utilizing Adadelta optimizer can effectively enhance the performance of the proposed model. The experimental results demonstrate that the model proposed in this paper outperforms the SOTA model on the same dataset- thereby establishing its reliability as an assistant for pathologists in analyzing WSIs of breast cancer. Consequently- it significantly enhances both the efficiency and accuracy of doctors during the diagnostic process.
Rekha Baghel- Ela Kumar,Enhancing Breast Cancer Diagnosis: Stacked Neural Networks for Reducing Data Imbalance,Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) are the most common forms of breast cancer and leading causes of death among women globally. Early detection of these subtypes with the aid of routinely collected demographic and clinical data is a feasible strategy and facilitates cancer routine care. Due to its widespread use- it could potentially benefit from the use of machine learning models to aid clinicians in their diagnosis workflow. Thus- we aimed to develop ML models using data retrieved from electronic health records corresponding to 1021 patients to accurately predict and classify these subtypes. Of note- prediction models were built using decision trees- naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve bayes- logistic regression- random forest and support vector machine. The classifiers' performances were assessed using accuracy- precision- recall and area under the curve. It is worth noting that the SVM model outperformed the ILC and IDC diagnostic response with an overall accuracy of 83% (AUC score 85%- precision 88% and recall 30%) than the other models. These findings highlight that it is feasible to develop a precise prognostic model by fusing various clinical and demographic data. The positive outcomes show the promise of using machine models as diagnostic aid tools for pathologists in clinical practice.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive asymptomatic patients who underwent mammography with DBT (2019-2020). Two AI systems (Transpara 1.7.0 and ProFound AI 3.0) were used to evaluate the DBT examinations. The systems were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for detecting malignancy overall and within subgroups based on mammographic breast density. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System results obtained from standard-of-care human double-reading were compared against AI results with use of the DeLong test. Results Of 419 female patients (median age- 60 years [IQR- 52-70 years]) included- 58 had histologically proven breast cancer.

Madhumita Pal- Ganapati Panda- Ranjan K Mohapatra- Adyasha Rath- Sujata Dash- Mohd Asif Shah- Saurav Mallik,Ensemble approach of deep learning models for binary and multiclass classification of histopathological images for breast cancer,"Detecting patients at high risk of occurrence of an Invasive Disease Event after a first diagnosis of breast cancer- such as recurrence- distant metastasis- contralateral tumor and second tumor- could support clinical decision-making processes in the treatment of this malignancy. Though several machine learning models analyzing both clinical and histopathological information have been developed in literature to address this task- these approaches turned out to be unsuitable for describing this problem. In this study- we designed a novel artificial intelligence-based approach which converts clinical information into an image-form to be analyzed through Convolutional Neural Networks. Specifically- we predicted the occurrence of an Invasive Disease Event at both 5-year and 10-year follow-ups of 696 female patients with a first invasive breast cancer diagnosis enrolled at IRCCS ""Giovanni Paolo II"" in Bari- Italy. After transforming each patient- represented by a vector of clinical information- to an image form- we extracted low-level quantitative imaging features by means of a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network- namely- AlexNET. Then- we classified breast cancer patients in the two classes- namely- Invasive Disease Event and non-Invasive Disease Event- via a Support Vector Machine classifier trained on a subset of significative features previously identified. Both 5-year and 10-year models resulted particularly accurate in predicting breast cancer recurrence event- achieving an AUC value of 92.07% and 92.84%- an accuracy of 88.71% and 88.82%- a sensitivity of 86.83% and 88.06%- a specificity of 89.55% and 89.3%- a precision of 71.93% and 84.82%- respectively. This is the first study proposing an approach which converts clinical information into an image-form to develop a decision support system for identifying patients at high risk of occurrence of an Invasive Disease Event- and then defining personalized oncological therapeutic treatments for breast cancer patients."

Addressing this problem could promote understanding of the cardiovascular impact of breast cancer. Data were obtained from the UK Biobank. Information on the diagnosis of breast cancer- MI- and HF was collected at baseline and follow-ups (median = 12.8 years). The propensity score matching method and Cox proportional hazards models were employed. A total of 251-277 female participants (mean age: 56.8 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 8.0 years)- of whom 16-241 had breast cancer- were included. Among breast cancer participants- younger age at diagnosis (per 10-year decrease) was significantly associated with elevated risks of MI (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.36- 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.19-1.56- p<0.001) and HF (HR = 1.31- 95% CI 1.18-1.46- p<0.001). After propensity score matching- breast cancer patients with younger diagnosis age had significantly higher risks of MI and HF than controls without breast cancer. Younger age at diagnosis of breast cancer was associated with higher risks of incident MI and HF- underscoring the necessity to pay additional attention to the cardiovascular health of breast cancer patients diagnosed at younger age to conduct timely interventions to attenuate the subsequent risks of incident cardiovascular diseases. This study was supported by grants from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (82373665 and 81974490)- the Nonprofit Central Research Institute Fund of Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (2021-RC330-001)- and the 2022 China Medical Board-open competition research grant (22-466).
Hasna El Haji- Nada Sbihi- Bassma Guermah- Amine Souadka- Mounir Ghogho,Epidemiological breast cancer prediction by country: A novel machine learning approach,The I-SPY 2 trial is a national-wide- multi-institutional clinical trial designed to evaluate multiple new therapeutic drugs for high-risk breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that pathological complete response (pCR) is a viable indicator of long-term outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer. While pCR can be assessed during surgery after the chemotherapy- early prediction of pCR before the completion of the chemotherapy may facilitate personalized treatment management to achieve an improved outcome. Notably- the acquisition of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) images at multiple time points during the I-SPY 2 trial opens up the possibility of achieving early pCR prediction. In this study- we investigated the feasibility of the early prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using multi-time point DCEMR images and clinical data acquired in the I-SPY2 trial. The prediction uncertainty was also quantified to allow physicians to make patient-specific decisions on treatment plans based on the level of associated uncertainty. The dataset used in our study included 624 patients with DCEMR images acquired at 3 time points before the completion of the chemotherapy: pretreatment (T0)- after 3 cycles of treatment (T1)- and after 12 cycles of treatment (T2). A convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning model- which integrated multi-time point deep image representations with clinical data- including tumor subtypes- was developed to predict pCR. The performance of the model was evaluated via the method of nested 5-fold cross validation. Moreover- we also quantified prediction uncertainty for each patient through test-time augmentation. To investigate the relationship between predictive performance and uncertainty- the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed on subgroups of patients stratified by the uncertainty score. By integrating clinical data and DCEMR images obtained at three-time points before treatment completion- the AUROC reached 0.833 with a sensitivity of 0.723 and specificity of 0.800. This performance was significantly superior (pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ <Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.01) to models using only images (AUROCÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.706) or only clinical data (AUROCÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.746). After stratifying the patients into eight subgroups based on the uncertainty score- we found that group #1- with the lowest uncertainty- had a superior AUROC of 0.873. The AUROC decreased to 0.637 for group #8- which had the highest uncertainty. The results indicate that our convolutional LSTM network-based deep learning model can be used to predict pCR earlier before the completion of chemotherapy. By combining clinical data and multi-time point deep image representations- our model outperforms models built solely on clinical or image data. Estimating prediction uncertainty may enable physicians to prioritize or disregard predictions based on their associated uncertainties. This approach could potentially enhance the personalization of breast cancer therapy.

Purpose To compare workload and screening performance for two cohorts of women who underwent screening before and after AI system implementation. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included 50-69-year-old women who underwent biennial mammography screening in the Capital Region of Denmark. Before AI system implementation (October 1- 2020- to November 17- 2021)- all screenings involved double reading. For screenings conducted after AI system implementation (November 18- 2021- to October 17- 2022)- likely normal screenings (AI examination score â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼5 before May 3- 2022- or â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼7 on or after May 3- 2022) were single read by one of 19 senior full-time breast radiologists. The remaining screenings were read by two radiologists with AI-assisted decision support. Biopsy and surgical outcomes were retrieved between October 1- 2020- and April 15- 2023- ensuring at least 180 days of follow-up. Screening metrics were compared using the â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬âˆž2 test. Reading workload reduction was measured as saved screening reads. Results In total- 60â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢751 and 58â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢246 women were screened before and after AI system implementation- respectively (median age- 58 years [IQR- 54-64 years] for both cohorts)- with a median screening interval before AI of 845 days (IQR- 820-878 days) and with AI of 993 days (IQR- 968-1013 days; P < .001). After AI system implementation- the recall rate decreased by 20.5% (3.09% before AI [1875 of 60â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢751] vs 2.46% with AI [1430 of 58â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢246]; P < .001)- the cancer detection rate increased (0.70% [423 of 60â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢751] vs 0.82% [480 of 58â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢246]; P = .01)- the false-positive rate decreased (2.39% [1452 of 60â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢751] vs 1.63% [950 of 58â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢246]; P < .001)- the positive predictive value increased (22.6% [423 of 1875] vs 33.6% [480 of 1430]; P < .001)- the rate of small cancers (â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼1 cm) increased (36.6% [127 of 347] vs 44.9% [164 of 365]; P = .02)- the rate of node-negative cancers was unchanged (76.7% [253 of 330] vs 77.8% [273 of 351]; P = .73)- and the rate of invasive cancers decreased (84.9% [359 of 423] vs 79.6% [382 of 480]; P = .04). The reading workload was reduced by 33.5% (38â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢977 of 116â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢492 reads).

Shriram Ashok Rajurkar- Teerthraj Verma- Rajeev Gupta,Estimation of heart dose in left breast cancer radiotherapy: Assessment of vDIBH feasibility using the supervised machine learning algorithm,Invasive breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning require an accurate assessment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) expression levels. While immunohistochemical techniques (IHC) are the gold standard for HER2 evaluation- their implementation can be resource-intensive and costly. To reduce these obstacles and expedite the procedure- we present an efficient deep-learning model that generates high-quality IHC-stained images directly from Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images. We propose a new IHC-GAN that enhances the Pix2PixHD model into a dual generator module- improving its performance and simplifying its structure. Furthermore- to strengthen feature extraction for HE-stained image classification- we integrate MobileNetV3 as the backbone network. The extracted features are then merged with those generated by the generator to improve overall performance. Moreover- the decoder's performance is enhanced by providing the related features from the classified labels by incorporating the adaptive instance normalization technique. The proposed IHC-GAN was trained and validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 4-870 registered image pairs- encompassing a spectrum of HER2 expression levels. Our findings demonstrate promising results in translating H&E images to IHC-equivalent representations- offering a potential solution to reduce the costs associated with traditional HER2 assessment methods. We extensively validate our model and the current dataset. We compare it with state-of-the-art techniques- achieving high performance using different evaluation metrics- showing 0.0927 FID- 22.87 PSNR- and 0.3735 SSIM. The proposed approach exhibits significant enhancements over current GAN models- including an 88% reduction in Frechet Inception Distance (FID)- a 4% enhancement in Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS)- a 10% increase in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)- and a 45% reduction in Mean Squared Error (MSE). This advancement holds significant potential for enhancing efficiency- reducing manpower requirements- and facilitating timely treatment decisions in breast cancer care.

This retrospective study included 326 patients with pathologically proven breast cancer (TNBC: 129- non-TNBC: 197). The lesions were segmented using the ITK-SNAP software- and whole-volume radiomics features were extracted using a radiomics platform. Radiomics features were obtained from DCE-MRI and ADC maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was employed for feature selection. Three prediction models were constructed using a support vector machine classifier: Model A (based on the selected features of the ADC maps)- Model B (based on the selected features of DCE-MRI)- and Model C (based on the selected features of both combined). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the conventional MR image model and the 3 radiomics models in predicting TNBC. In the training dataset- the AUCs for the conventional MR image model and the 3 radiomics models were 0.749- 0.801- 0.847- and 0.896. The AUCs for the conventional MR image model and 3 radiomics models in the validation dataset were 0.693- 0.742- 0.793- and 0.876- respectively. Radiomics based on the combination of whole volume DCE-MRI and ADC maps is a promising tool for distinguishing between TNBC and non-TNBC.

Randomized clinical trials provide evidence supporting de-escalation of axillary surgery and omission of SLNB in patients at low risk. However- identifying sentinel lymph node macrometastases (macro-SLNMs) is crucial for planning treatment tailored to the individual patient. This study is the first to explore the capacity of deep learning (DL) models to identify macro-SLNMs based on preoperative clinicopathological characteristics. We trained and validated five multivariable models using a population-based cohort of 18-185 patients. DL models outperform logistic regression- with Transformer showing the strongest results- under the constraint that the sensitivity is no less than 90%- reflecting the sensitivity of SLNB. This highlights the feasibility of noninvasive macro-SLNM prediction using DL. Feature importance analysis revealed that patients with similar characteristics exhibited different nodal status predictions- indicating the need for additional predictors for further improvement.
Jihane Bouziane- Pierre Loap- Kim Cao- Lea Pauly- Alain Fourquet- Youlia Kirova,Evolution of breast cancer management after mediastinal hodgkin lymphoma: Towards a breast- conserving approach,Preoperative assessment of axillary lymph node (ALN) status is essential for breast cancer management. This study explores the use of photoacoustic (PA) imaging combined with attention-guided deep learning (DL) for precise prediction of ALN status. This retrospective study included patients with histologically confirmed early-stage breast cancer from 2022 to 2024- randomly divided (8:2) into training and test cohorts. All patients underwent preoperative dual modal photoacoustic-ultrasound (PA-US) examination- were treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection- and were pathologically examined to determine the ALN status. Attention-guided DL model was developed using PA-US images to predict ALN status. A clinical model- constructed via multivariate logistic regression- served as the baseline for comparison. Subsequently- a nomogram incorporating the DL model and independent clinical parameters was developed. The performance of the models was evaluated through discrimination- calibration- and clinical applicability. A total of 324 patients (mean age Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± standard deviation- 51.0 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 10.9 years) were included in the study and were divided into a development cohort (n = 259 [79.9%]) and a test cohort (n = 65 [20.1%]). The clinical model incorporating three independent clinical parameters yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.775 (95% confidence interval [CI]- 0.711-0.829) in the training cohort and 0.783 (95% CI- 0.654-0.897) in the test cohort for predicting ALN status. In comparison- the nomogram showed superior predictive performance- with an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI- 0.867-0.940) in the training cohort and 0.868 (95% CI- 0.769-0.954) in the test cohort. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the nomogram's clinical applicability- demonstrating a better net benefit across relevant threshold probabilities. This study highlights the effectiveness of attention-guided PA imaging in breast cancer patients- providing novel nomograms for individualized clinical decision-making in predicting ALN node status.
Md Kaderi Kibria- Md Ahad Ali- Md Nurul Haque Mollah,Exploring bacterial key genes and therapeutic agents for breast cancer among the Ghanaian female population: Insights from In Silico analyses,Toxicity to systemic cancer treatment represents a major anxiety for patients and a challenge to treatment plans. We aimed to develop machine learning algorithms for the upfront prediction of an individual's risk of experiencing treatment-relevant toxicity during the course of treatment. Clinical records were retrieved from a single-center- consecutive cohort of patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment for early breast cancer. We developed and validated machine learning algorithms to predict grade 3 or 4 toxicity (anemia- neutropenia- deviation of liver enzymes- nephrotoxicity- thrombopenia- electrolyte disturbance- or neuropathy). We used 10-fold cross-validation to develop two algorithms (logistic regression with elastic net penalty [GLM] and support vector machines [SVMs]). Algorithm predictions were compared with documented toxicity events and diagnostic performance was evaluated via area under the curve (AUROC). A total of 590 patients were identified- 432 in the development set and 158 in the validation set. The median age was 51 years- and 55.8% (329 of 590) experienced grade 3 or 4 toxicity. The performance improved significantly when adding referenced treatment information (referenced regimen- referenced summation dose intensity product) in addition to patient and tumor variables: GLM AUROC 0.59 versus 0.75- P = .02; SVM AUROC 0.64 versus 0.75- P = .01. The individual risk of treatment-relevant toxicity can be predicted using machine learning algorithms. We demonstrate a promising way to improve efficacy and facilitate proactive toxicity management of systemic cancer treatment.

Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment is recommended for evaluating treatment efficacy in elderly cancer patients based on physiological classification. However- research on molecular classification in older cancer patients remains insufficient. In this study- we identified two subgroups with distinct senescent clusters among geriatric breast cancer patients through multi-omics analysis. Using various machine learning algorithms- we developed a comprehensive scoring model called ""Sene_Signature-"" which more accurately distinguished elderly breast cancer patients compared with existing methods and better predicted their prognosis. The Sene_Signature was correlated with tumor immune cell infiltration- as supported by single-cellÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ transcriptomics- RNA sequencing- and pathological data. Furthermore- we observed increased drug responsiveness in patients with a high Sene_Signature to treatments targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor and cell-cycle pathways. We also established a user-friendly web platform to assist investigators in assessing Sene_Signature scores and predicting treatment responses for elderly breast cancer patients. In conclusion- we developed a novel model for evaluating prognosis and therapeutic responses- providing a potential molecular classification thatÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ assists in the pre-treatment assessment of geriatric breast cancer."

Maryam Behyari- Mahla Behyari,Expression of Intragenic LCAL4 Long Non-Coding RNAs as a Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Marker in Female Breast Cancer,In breast cancer treatment- accurately predicting how long a patient will survive is crucial for decision-making. This information guides treatment choices and supports patients' psychological recovery. To address this challenge- we introduce a novel predictive model to forecast breast cancer prognosis by leveraging diverse data sources- including clinical records- copy number variation- gene expressions- DNA methylation- microRNA sequencing- and whole slide image data from the TCGA Database. The methodology incorporates graph contrastive learning with cross-modality attention (CAGCL)- considering all possible combinations of the six distinct data modalities. Feature embeddings are enhanced through graph contrastive learning- which identifies subtle differences and similarities among samples. Further- to learn the complementary nature of information across multiple data modalities- a cross-attention framework is proposed and applied to the graph contrastive learning-based extracted features from various data sources for breast cancer survival prediction. It performs a binary classification to anticipate the likelihood of short- and long-term breast cancer survivors- delineated by a five-year threshold. The proposed model (CAGCL) showcases superior performance compared to baseline models and other state-of-the-art models. The model attains an accuracy of 0.932- a sensitivity of 0.954- a precision of 0.958- an F1 score of 0.956- and an AUC of 0.948- underscoring its effectiveness in predicting breast cancer survival.
Shahad Awadelkarim,Feature Selection using Extra Trees for Breast Cancer Prediction,Breast cancer continues to pose a significant global health challenge- emphasizing the need for advancements in early detection methods. This study explores the application of transfer learning techniques- specifically utilizing EfficientNet- to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection through medical imaging. Leveraging a dataset of mammography images from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)- the research implements various data preprocessing methods- including median filtering- contrast enhancement- and artifact removal- to ensure the quality of input data. The EfficientNet model- trained with these preprocessed images- is evaluated against other transfer learning architectures- such as DenseNet and ResNeXt50- using metrics like accuracy- AUC- precision- and F1-score. The results demonstrate that EfficientNet outperforms other models- achieving an accuracy of 95.23%- with a sensitivity of 96.67% and specificity of 93.82%. These findings suggest that transfer learning- particularly with EfficientNet- can significantly improve the predictive accuracy of breast cancer detection- offering a reliable tool for early diagnosis and personalized treatment planning. The study also discusses the potential integration of these models into clinical workflows- addressing challenges such as data privacy- model generalizability- and clinical applicability. Future research will focus on expanding the dataset and exploring the use of other advanced deep learning techniques to further enhance detection accuracy and robustness.
Xuelei Chen- Qilin Yan- Youjuan Tang- Jianing Zhu- Wenlu Zhang- Jingping Zhang,Financial toxicity- family resilience and negative emotions among young and middle-aged breast cancer patients: A multicentre cross-sectional study,Cancer diagnosis and classification are pivotal for effective patient management and treatment planning. In this study- a comprehensive approach is presented utilizing ensemble deep learning techniques to analyze breast cancer histopathology images. Our datasets were based on two widely employed datasets from different centers for two different tasks: BACH and BreakHis. Within the BACH dataset- a proposed ensemble strategy was employed- incorporating VGG16 and ResNet50 architectures to achieve precise classification of breast cancer histopathology images. Introducing a novel image patching technique to preprocess a high-resolution image facilitated a focused analysis of localized regions of interest. The annotated BACH dataset encompassed 400 WSIs across four distinct classes: Normal- Benign- In Situ Carcinoma- and Invasive Carcinoma. In addition- the proposed ensemble was used on the BreakHis dataset- utilizing VGG16- ResNet34- and ResNet50 models to classify microscopic images into eight distinct categories (four benign and four malignant). For both datasets- a five-fold cross-validation approach was employed for rigorous training and testing. Preliminary experimental results indicated a patch classification accuracy of 95.31% (for the BACH dataset) and WSI image classification accuracy of 98.43% (BreakHis). This research significantly contributes to ongoing endeavors in harnessing artificial intelligence to advance breast cancer diagnosis- potentially fostering improved patient outcomes and alleviating healthcare burdens.
Xinru Chen- Yingying Zhao- Yaohui Wang- Yumei Ye- Shuguang Xu- Liheng Zhou- Yanping Lin- Jingsong Lu- Wenjin Yin,Fluctuations in serum lipid levels during neoadjuvant treatment as novel predictive and prognostic biomarkers for locally advanced breast cancer: a retrospective analysis based on a prospective cohort,Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer in women- recognized as one of the most dangerous types of cancer- and is on the rise globally. Regular screenings are essential for early-stage treatment. Digital mammography (DM) is the most recognized and widely used technique for breast cancer screening. Contrast-Enhanced Spectral Mammography (CESM or CM) is used in conjunction with DM to detect and identify hidden abnormalities- particularly in dense breast tissue where DM alone might not be as effective. In this work- we explore the effectiveness of each modality (CM- DM- or both) in detecting breast cancer lesions using deep learning methods. We introduce an architecture for detecting and classifying breast cancer lesions in DM and CM images in Craniocaudal (CC) and Mediolateral Oblique (MLO) views. The proposed architecture (JointNet) consists of a convolution module for extracting local features- a transformer module for extracting long-range features- and a feature fusion layer to fuse the local features- global features- and global features weighted based on the local ones. This significantly enhances the accuracy of classifying DM and CM images into normal or abnormal categories and lesion classification into benign or malignant. Using our architecture as a backbone- three lesion classification pipelines are introduced that utilize attention mechanisms focused on lesion shape- texture- and overall breast texture- examining the critical features for effective lesion classification. The results demonstrate that our proposed methods outperform their components in classifying images as normal or abnormal and mitigate the limitations of independently using the transformer module or the convolution module. An ensemble model is also introduced to explore the effect of each modality and each view to increase our baseline architecture's accuracy. The results demonstrate superior performance compared with other similar works. The best performance on DM images was achieved with the semi-automatic AOL Lesion Classification Pipeline- yielding an accuracy of 98.85Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- AUROC of 0.9965- F1-score of 98.85Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- precision of 98.85Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- and specificity of 98.85Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %. For CM images- the highest results were obtained using the automatic AOL Lesion Classification Pipeline- with an accuracy of 97.47Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- AUROC of 0.9771- F1-score of 97.34Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- precision of 94.45Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- and specificity of 97.23Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %. The semi-automatic ensemble AOL Classification Pipeline provided the best overall performance when using both DM and CM images- with an accuracy of 94.74Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- F1-score of 97.67Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- specificity of 93.75Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- and sensitivity of 95.45Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %. Furthermore- we explore the comparative effectiveness of CM and DM images in deep learning models- indicating that while CM images offer clearer insights to the human eye- our model trained on DM images yields better results using Attention on Lesion (AOL) techniques. The research also suggests a multimodal approach using both DM and CM images and ensemble learning could provide more robust classification outcomes.
Lyudmila V Bel'skaya- Elena A Sarf- Denis V Solomatin,Free Salivary Amino Acid Profile in Breast Cancer: Clinicopathological and Molecular Biological Features,"Breast cancer significantly impacts women's health- with ultrasound being crucial for lesion assessment. To enhance diagnostic accuracy- computer-aided detection (CAD) systems have attracted considerable interest. This study introduces a prospective deep learning architecture called ""Multi-modal Multi-task Network"" (3MT-Net). 3MT-Net utilizes a combination of clinical data- B-mode- and color Doppler ultrasound. We have designed the AM-CapsNet network- specifically tailored to extract crucial tumor features from ultrasound. To combine clinical data in 3MT-Net- we have employed a cascaded cross-attention to fuse information from three distinct sources. To ensure the preservation of pertinent information during the fusion of high-dimensional and low-dimensional data- we adopt the idea of ensemble learning and design an optimization algorithm to assign weights to different modalities. Eventually- 3MT-Net performs binary classification of benign and malignant lesions as well as pathological subtype classification. In addition- we retrospectively collected data from nine medical centers. To ensure the broad applicability of the 3MT-Net- we created two separate testsets and conducted extensive experiments. Furthermore- a comparative analysis was conducted between 3MT-Net and the industrial-grade CAD product S-detect. The AUC of 3MT-Net surpasses S-Detect by 1.4% to 3.8%."
Haitian Gui- Tao Su- Xinhua Jiang- Li Li- Lang Xiong- Ji Zhou- Zhiyong Pang,FS-YOLOv9: A Frequency and Spatial Feature-Based YOLOv9 for Real-time Breast Cancer Detection,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is increasingly used in breast cancer. Predictive modeling is useful in predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) to NAC. We test machine learning (ML) models to predict pCR in breast cancer and explore methods of handling missing data. Four hundred and ninety-nine patients with breast cancer treated with NAC in two centers in Singapore (National Cancer Centre Singapore [NCCS] and KK Hospital) between January 2014 and December 2017 were included. Eleven clinical features were used to train five different ML models. Listwise deletion and imputation were evaluated on handling missing data. Model performance was evaluated by AUC and calibration (Brier score). Feature importance from the best performing model in the external testing data set was calculated using Shapley additive explanations. Seventy-two (24.6%)- 18 (24.7%)- and 31 (24.8%) patients attained pCR in NCCS training- NCCS testing- and KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) testing data sets- respectively. The random forest (RF) base and imputed models have the highest AUCs in the KKH cohort of 0.794 (95% CI- 0.709 to 0.873) and 0.795 (95% CI- 0.706 to 0.871)- respectively- and were the best calibrated with the lowest Brier score. No statistically significant difference was noted between AUCs of the base and imputed models in all data sets. The imputed model had a larger positive predictive value (PPV; 98.2% v 95.1%) and negative predictive value (NPV; 96.7% v 90.0%) than the base model in the KKH data set. Estrogen receptor intensity- human epidermal growth factor 2 intensity- and age at diagnosis were the three most important predictors. ML- particularly RF- demonstrates reasonable accuracy in pCR prediction after NAC. Imputing missing fields in the data can improve the PPV and NPV of the pCR prediction model.

Mittendorf,Generative artificial intelligence as a source of breast cancer information for patients: Proceed with caution.,<title>Abstract</title> <p>Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent causes of cancer-related death globally. Preliminary diagnosis of breast cancer increases the patient's chances of survival and healing. In this paper- we propose a hybrid deep transfer learning model integrating xception with support vector classifier (XSV) and xception with random forest (XRF) along with pre-processing technique to classify breast cancer as cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign) along comparative analysis of prominent machine learning classifiers- such as Random Forest Classifier (RFC)- Logistic Regression (LR)- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)- K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN)- and Ada-boost. In experiment all the models are implemented on two openly accessible datasets: BreakHis and Breast Histopathology Images Database (BHID) across various metrics such as accuracy- area under the receiver operating curve- precision- recall- f1-score- Matthew's correlation coefficient- classification success index- and kappa at different magnification levels of images. Our proposed model that utilized the fine tuning of xception model in conjunction with RFC and SVC- surpass existing breast cancer classification methodologies. Specifically- the XSV that achieved accuracies of 89.26%- 85.87%- 90.17%- and 88.98%- while the XRF attained accuracies of 87.78%- 84.78%- 88.98%- and 87.61% for BreakHis at 40X- 100X- 200X- and 400X magnifications- respectively. For BHID at 40X magnification- the XSV and XRF models achieved accuracies of 87.35% and 87.29%- respectively. Employing this study will aid our medical practitioners and researchers in choosing an accurate model for tumor classification and our results will help medical professionals to classify the disease with precision.</p>
Zhicheng Deng- Mengdie Ou- Yonghui Shi- Guocheng Li- Li Lv,Ginsenoside Rg3 attenuates the stemness of breast cancer stem cells by activating the hippo signaling pathway,Background Artificial intelligence (AI) systems can be used to identify interval breast cancers- although the localizations are not always accurate. Purpose To evaluate AI localizations of interval cancers (ICs) on screening mammograms by IC category and histopathologic characteristics. Materials and Methods A screening mammography data set (median patient age- 57 years [IQR- 52-64 years]) that had been assessed by two human readers from January 2011 to December 2018 was retrospectively analyzed using a commercial AI system. The AI outputs were lesion locations (heatmaps) and the highest per-lesion risk score (range- 0-100) assigned to each case. AI heatmaps were considered false positive (FP) if they occurred on normal screening mammograms or on IC screening mammograms (ie- in patients subsequently diagnosed with IC) but outside the cancer boundary. A panel of consultant radiology experts classified ICs as normal or benign (true negative [TN])- uncertain (minimal signs of malignancy [MS])- or suspicious (false negative [FN]). Several specificity and sensitivity thresholds were applied. Mann-Whitney U tests- Kruskal-Wallis tests- and â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬âˆž2 tests were used to compare groups. Results A total of 2052 screening mammograms (514 ICs and 1548 normal mammograms) were included. The median AI risk score was 50 (IQR- 32-82) for TN ICs- 76 (IQR- 41-90) for ICs with MS- and 89 (IQR- 81-95) for FN ICs (P = .005). Higher median AI scores were observed for invasive tumors (62 [IQR- 39-88]) than for noninvasive tumors (33 [IQR- 20-55]; P < .01) and for high-grade (grade 2-3) tumors (62 [IQR- 40-87]) than for low-grade (grade 0-1) tumors (45 [IQR- 26-81]; P = .02). At the 96% specificity threshold- the AI algorithm flagged 121 of 514 (23.5%) ICs and correctly localized the IC in 93 of 121 (76.9%) cases- with 48 FP heatmaps on the mammograms for ICs (rate- 0.093 per case) and 74 FP heatmaps on normal mammograms (rate- 0.048 per case). The AI algorithm correctly localized a lower proportion of TN ICs (54 of 427; 12.6%) than ICs with MS (35 of 76; 46%) and FN ICs (four of eight; 50% [95% CI: 13- 88]; P < .001). The AI algorithm localized a higher proportion of node-positive than node-negative cancers (P = .03). However- no evidence of a difference by cancer type (P = .09)- grade (P = .27)- or hormone receptor status (P = .12) was found. At 89.8% specificity and 79% sensitivity thresholds- AI detection increased to 181 (35.2%) and 256 (49.8%) of the 514 ICs- respectively- with FP heatmaps on 158 (10.2%) and 307 (19.8%) of the 1548 normal mammograms. Conclusion Use of a standalone AI system improved early cancer detection by correctly identifying some cancers missed by two human readers- with no differences based on histopathologic features except for node-positive cancers.

Previous studies have investigated estimating and predicting the proportional hazard rates and survival in breast cancer. This study deals with predicting accelerated hazards (AH) rate based on age categories in breast cancer patients using deep learning methods. The AH has a time-dependent structure whose rate changes according to time and variable effects. We have collected data related to 1225 female patients with breast cancer at the Mandarin University of Medical Sciences. The patients' demographic and clinical characteristics including family history- age- history of tobacco use- hysterectomy- first menstruation age- gravida- number of breastfeeding- disease grade- marital status- and survival status have been recorded. Initially- we dealt with predicting three age groups of patients:â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢Â¬Â¨âˆšÃ¼â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢40- 41-60- andâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢61Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ years. Then- the prediction of accelerated risk value based on age categories for each breast cancer patient through deep learning and the importance of variables using LightGBM is discussed. Improving clinical management and treatment of breast cancer requires advanced methods such as time-dependent AH calculation. When the behavioral effect is assumed as a time scale change between hazard functions- the AH model is more appropriate for randomized clinical trials. The study results demonstrate the proper performance of the proposed model for predicting AH by age categories based on breast cancer patients' demographic and clinical characteristics.
Fatma M Talaat- Samah A Gamel- Rana Mohamed El-Balka- Mohamed Shehata- Hanaa ZainEldin,Grad-CAM Enabled Breast Cancer Classification with a 3D Inception-ResNet V2: Empowering Radiologists with Explainable Insights,This study aimed to design and evaluate a prior-knowledge-guided U-Net (PK-UNet) for automatic clinical target volume (CTV) segmentation in postmastectomy radiation therapy for breast cancer. A total of 102 computed tomography (CT) scans from breast cancer patients who underwent postmastectomy were retrospectively collected. Of these- 80 scans were used for training with 5-fold cross-validation- and 22 scans for independent testing. The CTV included the chest wall- supraclavicular region- and axillary group III. The proposed PK-UNet method employs a 2-stage auto-segmentation process. Initially- the localization network categorizes CT slices based on the anatomic information of the CTV and generates prior knowledge labels. These outputs- along with the CT images- were fed into the final segmentation network. Quantitative evaluation was conducted using the mean Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)- 95% Hausdorff distance- average surface distance- and surface DSC. A four-level objective scale evaluation was performed by 2 experienced radiation oncologists in a randomized double-blind manner. Quantitative evaluations revealed that PK-UNet significantly outperformed state-of-the-art segmentation methods (P < .01)- with a mean DSC of 0.90 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.02 and a 95% Hausdorff distance of 2.82 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 1.29 mm. The mean average surface distance of PK-UNet was 0.91 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.22 mm and the surface DSC was 0.84 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.07- significantly surpassing the performance of AdwU-Net (P < .01) and showing comparable results to other models. Clinical evaluation confirmed the efficacy of PK-UNet- with 81.8% of the predicted contours being acceptable for clinical application. The advantages of the auto-segmentation capability of PK-UNet were most evident in the superior and inferior slices and slices with discontinuities at the junctions of different subregions. The average manual correction time was reduced to 1.02 min- compared with 18.20 min for manual contouring leading to a 94.4% reduction in working time. This study introduced the pioneering integration of prior medical knowledge into a deep learning framework for postmastectomy radiation therapy. This strategy addresses the challenges of CTV segmentation in postmastectomy radiation therapy and improves clinical workflow efficiency.
Fengze Li- Jieming Ma- Tianxi Wen- Zhongbei Tian- Hai-Ning Liang,HI-Net: A novel histopathologic image segmentation model for metastatic breast cancer via lightweight dataset construction,Background/Objectives: Breast cancer remains one of the biggest health challenges for women worldwide- and early detection can be truly lifesaving. Although ultrasound imaging is commonly used to detect tumors- the images are not always of sufficient quality- and- thus- traditional U-Net models often miss the finer details needed for accurate detection. This outcome can result in lower accuracy- making early and precise diagnosis more difficult. Methods: This study presents an enhanced U-Net model integrated with a Capsule Network (called UCapsNet) to overcome the limitations of conventional techniques. Our approach improves segmentation by leveraging higher filter counts and skip connections- while the capsule network enhances classification by preserving spatial hierarchies through dynamic routing. The proposed UCapsNet model operates in two stages: first- it segments tumor regions using an enhanced U-Net- followed by a classification of the segmented images with the capsule network. Results: We have tested our model against well-known pre-trained models- including VGG-19- DenseNet- MobileNet- ResNet-50- and Xception. By properly addressing the limitations found in previous studies and using a capsule network trained on the Breast Ultrasound Image (BUSI) dataset- our model resulted in top-achieving impressive precision- recall- and accuracy rates of 98.12%- 99.52%- and 99.22%- respectively. Conclusions: By combining the U-Net's powerful segmentation capabilities with the capsule network's high classification accuracy- UCapsNet boosts diagnostic precision and addresses key weaknesses in existing methods. The findings demonstrate that the proposed model is not only more effective in detecting tumors but also more reliable for practical applications in clinical settings.
Yushu Ma- Chien-Hung Shih- Jinxiong Cheng- Hsiao-Chun Chen- Li-Ju Wang- Yanhao Tan- Yu-Chiao Chiu- Yu-Chih Chen,High-Throughput Empirical and Virtual Screening to Discover Novel Inhibitors of Polyploid Giant Cancer Cells in Breast Cancer,Breast cancer (BC) is a type of cancer which progresses and spreads from breast tissues and gradually exceeds the entire body; this kind of cancer originates in both sexes. Prompt recognition of this disorder is most significant in this phase- and it is measured by providing patients with the essential treatment so their efficient lifetime can be protected. Scientists and researchers in numerous studies have initiated techniques to identify tumours in early phases. Still- misperception in classifying skeptical lesions can be due to poor image excellence and dissimilar breast density. BC is a primary health concern- requiring constant initial detection and improvement in analysis. BC analysis has made major progress recently with combining multi-modal image modalities.Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ These studies deliver an overview of the segmentation- classification- or grading of numerous cancer types- including BC- by employing conventional machine learning (ML) models over hand-engineered features. Therefore- this study uses multi-modality medical imaging to propose a Computer Vision with Fusion Joint Transfer Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis (CVFBJTL-BCD) technique. The presented CVFBJTL-BCD technique utilizes feature fusion and DL models to effectively detect and identify BC diagnoses. The CVFBJTL-BCD technique primarily employs the Gabor filtering (GF) technique for noise removal. Next- the CVFBJTL-BCD technique uses a fusion-based joint transfer learning (TL) process comprising three models- namely DenseNet201- InceptionV3- and MobileNetV2. The stacked autoencoders (SAE) model is implemented to classify BC diagnosis. Finally- the horse herd optimization algorithm (HHOA) model is utilized to select parameters involved in the SAE method optimally. To demonstrate the improved results of the CVFBJTL-BCD methodology- a comprehensive series of experimentations are performed on two benchmark datasets. The comparative analysis of the CVFBJTL-BCD technique portrayed a superior accuracy value of 98.18% and 99.15% over existing methods under Histopathological and Ultrasound datasets.

Expert physicians carefully select- verify- and categorize the dataset to guarantee its quality and dependability for use in research and teaching. The dataset- which originates from Sulaymaniyah- Iraq- provides a distinctive viewpoint on the frequency and features of breast cancer in the area. This dataset offers a wealth of information for developing and testing deep learning algorithms for identifying breast cancer- with 745 original images and 9-685 augmented images. The addition of augmented X-rays to the dataset increases its adaptability for algorithm development and instructional projects. This dataset holds immense potential for advancing medical research- aiding in the development of innovative diagnostic tools- and fostering educational opportunities for medical students interested in breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
Sahebrao B Pawar- N K Deshmukh- Sharad B Jadhav,Hybrid deep learning technique for COX-2 inhibition bioactivity detection against breast cancer disease,Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer- as many physicians may not be aware of it in terms of symptoms and diagnosis. Mammography is the first choice in breast screenings and diagnosis. Because of a lack of expertise and imaging datasets- IBC portrayal and machine learning-based diagnosis systems have not yet been studied thoroughly. Developing scanning and diagnosis tools can close the knowledge gap and barriers to a timely IBC diagnosis. The dataset includes 20 women aged 34-75- of whom 10 were clinically diagnosed with IBC and 10 with non-IBC. A breast mapping and scanning model was developed. Gray-level co-occurrence matrices were used to characterize skin thickening- edema- breast density- microcalcifications- and breast size asymmetry in bilateral mammographic images. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was performed to evaluate differences between mammogram breasts with IBC- non-IBC- and healthy breasts. Higher breast density variations were calculated in breasts with IBC in the anterior (PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.0147) and middle (PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.0026) regions. Breasts with IBC showed higher microcalcifications (PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.0472) than the other breasts- and bilateral analyses showed higher variations (PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.1367). Breast size asymmetry (PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.9833) was not significantly different between the groups. Skin thickening- edema- and breast density-related parameters were found to be associated with IBC. This study thus lays the foundation of machine learning diagnosis models for IBC.
Zhongwen Zhang- Haolong Zhang- Zheng Zhang- Doblin Sandai- Ping Lu- Haoling Zhang- Jianjun Wu,Identification and validation of mRNA profiles linked to ATP- induced cell death represent a novel prognostic model for breast cancer,Research concerning artificial intelligence in breast cancer detection has primarily focused on population screening. However- Hong Kong lacks a population-based screening programme. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis (AI-CAD) program in symptomatic clinics in Hong Kong and analyse the impact of radio-pathological breast cancer phenotype on AI-CAD performance. In total- 398 consecutive patients with 414 breast cancers were retrospectively identified from a local- prospectively maintained database managed by two tertiary referral centres between January 2020 and September 2022. The full-field digital mammography images were processed using a commercial AI-CAD algorithm. An abnormality score <30 was considered a false negative- whereas a score of â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢90 indicated a high-score tumour. Abnormality scores were analysed with respect to the clinical and radio-pathological characteristics of breast cancer- tumour-to-breast area ratio (TBAR)- and tumour distance from the chest wall for cancers presenting as a mass. The median abnormality score across the 414 breast cancers was 95.6; sensitivity was 91.5% and specificity was 96.3%. High-score cancers were more often palpable- invasive- and presented as masses or architectural distortion (P<0.001). False-negative cancers were smaller- more common in dense breast tissue- and presented as asymmetrical densities (P<0.001). Large tumours with extreme TBARs and locations near the chest wall were associated with lower abnormality scores (P<0.001). Several strengths and limitations of AI-CAD were observed and discussed in detail. Artificial intelligence-based computer-assisted diagnosis shows potential value as a tool for breast cancer detection in symptomatic setting- which could provide substantial benefits to patients.
Zhensheng Hu- Cong Lai- Hongze Liu- Jianping Man- Kai Chen- Qian Ouyang- Yi Zhou,Identification and validation of screening models for breast cancer with 3 serum miRNAs in an 11-349 samples mixed cohort,We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted- and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression- independent clinical predictors- DL-Score- and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect- and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical- radiomics (Rad-Score)- and deep learning (DL-Score) models- the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895-0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838-0.973) in the validation set. Moreover- decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC- which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.

This study focuses on the role of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in breast cancer immunotherapy response. We conducted an analysis involving 1027 patients from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital- Sun Yat-sen University- and The Cancer Genome Atlas- utilizing RNA sequencing and pathology whole-slide images. We employed unsupervised clustering to identify distinct lncRNA expression patterns and developed an AI-based pathology model using convolutional neural networks to predict immune-metabolic subtypes. Additionally- we created a multimodal model integrating lncRNA data- immune-cell scores- clinical information- and pathology images for prognostic prediction. Our findings revealed four unique immune-metabolic subtypes- and the AI model demonstrated high predictive accuracy- highlighting the significant impact of lncRNAs on antitumor immunity and metabolic states within the tumor microenvironment. The AI-based pathology model- DeepClinMed-IM- exhibited high accuracy in predicting these subtypes. Additionally- the multimodal model- DeepClinMed-PGM- integrating pathology images- lncRNA data- immune-cell scores- and clinical information- showed superior prognostic performance. In conclusion- these AI models provide a robust foundation for precise prognostication and the identification of potential candidates for immunotherapy- advancing breast cancer research and treatment strategies.
Priyanga Paranthaman- Shanthi Veerappapillai,Identification of putative Indoleamine 2-3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2-3-dioxygenase (TDO) dual inhibitors for triple-negative breast cancer therapy,Machine learning (ML) involves developing algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data without being explicitly programmed. Because of its unlimited abilities ML is gaining popularity in medical sectors; Medical Imaging- Electronic Health Records- Genomic Data Analysis- Wearable Devices- Disease Outbreak Prediction- Disease Diagnosis- etc. In the last few decades- many researchers have tried to diagnose Breast Cancer (BC) using ML- because early detection of any disease can save millions of lives. Working in this direction- the authors have proposed a hybrid ML technique RBF SVM- to predict the BC in earlier the stage. The proposed method is implemented on the Breast Cancer UCI ML dataset with 569 instances and 32 attributes. The authors recorded performance metrics of the proposed model i.e.- Accuracy 98.24%- Sensitivity 98.67%- Specificity 97.43%- F1 Score 98.67%- Precision 98.67%- and run time 0.044769 seconds.

Ultrasound imaging is a common diagnostic tool for breast cancer- but interpreting ultrasound images can be challenging due to the complexity of breast tissue and the variability of image quality. This study proposed an Attention Gated Multi ResU-Net model for medical image segmentation tasks- that has shown promising results for breast cancer ultrasound image segmentation. The model's multi-scale feature extraction and attention-gating mechanism enable it to accurately identify and segment areas of abnormality in the breast tissue- such as masses- cysts- and calcifications. The model's quantitative test showed an adequate degree of agreement with expert manual annotations- demonstrating its potential for improving early identification and diagnosis of breast cancer. The model's multi-scale feature extraction and attention-gating mechanism enable it to accurately identify and segment areas of abnormality in the breast tissue- such as masses- cysts- and calcifications- achieving a Dice coefficient of 0.93- sensitivity of 93%- and specificity of 99%. These results underscore the model's high precision and reliability in medical image analysis.

However- the plasma concentration of pyrotinb in different patients varies greatly- and in the course of treatment- if patients have intolerable adverse reactions- the drug dosage will be reduced or even stopped. This study set out to establish an ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) for the determination of pyrotinb in human plasma- analyze the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) of pyrotinib and assess the influence of patient variables on PK of pyrotinib in patients with HER2 positive breast cancer. An UPLC-MS/MS method was developed to measure pyrotinib in human plasma. Utilizing a gradient elution procedure and a Kinetex C18 column (2.1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 100Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- 1.7Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´m)- sample separation was accomplished in 5.5Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ min. Pyrotinb extraction via protein precipitation was used as a sample pre-treatment technique. In total- 50 patients provided 158 plasma samples- which were identified and used in the PPK investigation. The non-linear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM) approach was used to assess the plasma concentrations and covariates information. For the final PPK model evaluation- external evaluation- non-parametric bootstrap- visual predictive check (VPC)- and goodness-of-fit (GOF) were used. The UPLC-MS/MS method for determining plasma concentration of pyrotinib in patients had good selectivity and linearity in the range of 1-1-000Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ ng/mL. Pyrotinib concentration profile in HER2-positive breast cancer patients was well described by a single-compartment PPK model with first-order absorption and elimination. The formulas for the final estimated values of overall parameters of CL/F and Vd/F and Ka are respectively: CL/FL/h=88.8â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢eTP/67.2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢0.376 - V/FL=3940 - KAh-1=0.357FIXED . No dosage adjustment was advised- despite the possibility that the total protein levels could have a substantial impact on the apparent distribution volume of pyrotinib with limited magnitude. In this study- an UPLC-MS/MS method was established to determine the concentration of pyrotinib in human plasma. A population pharmacokinetic model of pyrotinib in HER2 positive breast cancer patients suggested that low serum total protein reduced the clearance rate of pyrotinib in patients. Clinical medical staff should pay attention to the liver function of patients with abnormal serum total protein and be alert to the occurrence of adverse drug reactions.

Early detection and proper treatment reduce mortality rates. Histopathological images provide detailed information for diagnosing and staging breast cancer disease. Methods: The BreakHis dataset- which includes histopathological images- is used in this study. Medical images are prone to problems such as different textural backgrounds and overlapping cell structures- unbalanced class distribution- and insufficiently labeled data. In addition to these- the limitations of deep learning models in overfitting and insufficient feature extraction make it extremely difficult to obtain a high-performance model in this dataset. In this study- 20 state-of-the-art models are trained to diagnose eight types of breast cancer using the fine-tuning method. In addition- a comprehensive experimental study was conducted to determine the most successful new model- with 20 different custom models reported. As a result- we propose a novel model called MultiHisNet. Results: The most effective new model- which included a pointwise convolution layer- residual link- channel- and spatial attention module- achieved 94.69% accuracy in multi-class breast cancer classification. An ensemble model was created with the best-performing transfer learning and custom models obtained in the study- and model weights were determined with an Equilibrium Optimizer. The proposed ensemble model achieved 96.71% accuracy in eight-class breast cancer detection. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed model will support pathologists in successfully diagnosing breast cancer.
Basamma Patil- Vishwanath P- Mohammed Al-Farouni- B. Sathyavani- P. Pareek,Improved Butterfly Optimization Algorithm for Automated Breast Cancer Detection and Classification using Deep Learning,Breast cancer is considered one of the most-common types of cancers among females in the world- with a high mortality rate. Medical imaging is still one of the most-reliable tools to detect breast cancer. Unfortunately- manual image detection takes much time. This paper proposes a new deep learning method based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Convolutional Neural Networks are widely used for image classification. However- the determination process for accurate hyperparameters and architectures is still a challenging task. In this work- a highly accurate CNN model to detect breast cancer by mammography was developed. The proposed method is based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in order to look for suitable hyperparameters and the architecture for the CNN model. The CNN model using PSO achieved success rates of 98.23% and 97.98% on the DDSM and MIAS datasets- respectively. The experimental results proved that the proposed CNN model gave the best accuracy values in comparison with other studies in the field. As a result- CNN models for mammography classification can now be created automatically. The proposed method can be considered as a powerful technique for breast cancer prediction.
M Ramkumar- R Sarath Kumar- R Padmapriya- S Balu Mahandiran,Improved DeTraC Binary Coyote Net-Based Multiple Instance Learning for Predicting Lymph Node Metastasis of Breast Cancer From Whole-Slide Pathological Images,With the tremendous leap of various adjuvant therapies- breast cancer (BC)-related deaths have decreased significantly. Increasing attention was focused on the effect of cardiac disease on BC survivors- while limited existing population-based studies lay emphasis on the young age population. Data of BC patients aged less than 50Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ years was collected from the SEER database. A competing risk model was introduced to analyze the effects of clinicopathology variables on the cardiac disease-specific death (CDSD) risks of these patients. Further- an XGBoost prediction model was constructed to predict the risk of CDSD. Prediction performance was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis- area under the POC curve (AUC) values- calibration curves- decision curves- and confusion matrix- and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the models. Our competing risk analysis proved that young BC patients with older age- low household income- non-metropolitan residential environment- black race- unmarried status- HRâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢subtype- higher T stage (T2-4)- receiving chemotherapy- and non-surgery are under higher risk of CDSD. Further- five machine learning models were constructed to predict the CDSD risks of young BC patients- among which the XGBoost models showed the highest AUC value (train set: AUCâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.846; test set: AUCâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.836). The confusion matrix of the XGBoost model demonstrated that the sensitivity- specificity- and correction were 0.81- 0.94- and 0.94 for the train set- and 0.82- 0.95- and 0.96 for the test set- respectively. The SHAP graph indicated that median household income- marital status- race- and age at diagnosis were the top four strongest predictors. Independent CDSD risk factors for young BC patients were identified- and machine-learning prognostic models were constructed to predict their CDSD risks. Our validation results indicated that the predicted probability of our XGBoost model agrees well with the actual CDSD risks- and it can help recognize high-risk populations and therefore develop effective cardioprotection strategies. Hopefully- our findings can support the growth of the new field of cardio-oncology.

This article will undergo copyediting- layout- and proof review before it is published in its final version. Please note that during production of the final copyedited article- errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Purpose To develop a deep learning algorithm that uses temporal information to improve the performance of a previously published framework of cancer lesion detection for digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT). Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed the current and the 1-year prior Hologic DBT screening examinations from 8 different institutions between 2016 to 2020. The dataset contained 973 cancer and 7123 noncancer cases. The front-end of this algorithm was an existing deep learning framework that performed singleview lesion detection followed by ipsilateral view matching. For this study- PriorNet was implemented as a cascaded deep learning module that used the additional growth information to refine the final probability of malignancy. Data from seven of the eight sites were used for training and validation- while the eighth site was reserved for external testing. Model performance was evaluated using localization receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results On the validation set- PriorNet showed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.931 (95% CI 0.930- 0.931)- which outperformed both baseline models using single-view detection (AUC- 0.892 (95% CI 0.891-0.892)- P < .001) and ipsilateral matching (AUC- 0.915 (95% CI 0.914-0.915)- P < .001). On the external test set- PriorNet achieved an AUC of 0.896 (95% CI 0.885-0.896)- outperforming both baselines (AUCs- 0.846 (95% CI 0.846-0.847- P < .001) and 0.865 (95% CI 0.865-0.866) P < .001- respectively). In the high sensitivity range of 0.9 to 1.0- the partial AUC of PriorNet was significantly higher (P < .001) relative to both baselines. Conclusion PriorNet using temporal information further improved the breast cancer detection performance of an existing DBT cancer detection framework. Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â©RSNA- 2024."
Zimei Lin- Libin Chen- Yunzhong Wang- Tao Zhang- Pintong Huang,Improving ultrasound diagnostic Precision for breast cancer and adenosis with modality-specific enhancement (MSE) - Breast Net,Background and objectives: Breast cancer is the most prevalent type of cancer among women. The effectiveness of anticancer pharmacological therapy may get adversely affected by tumor heterogeneity that includes genetic and transcriptomic features. This leads to clinical variability in patient response to therapeutic drugs. Anticancer drug design and cancer understanding require precise identification of cancer drug responses. The performance of drug response prediction models can be improved by integrating multi-omics data and drug structure data. Methods: In this paper- we propose an Autoencoder (AE) and Graph Convolutional Network (AGCN) for drug response prediction- which integrates multi-omics data and drug structure data. Specifically- we first converted the high dimensional representation of each omic data to a lower dimensional representation using an AE for each omic data set. Subsequently- these individual features are combined with drug structure data obtained using a Graph Convolutional Network and given to a Convolutional Neural Network to calculate IC[Formula: see text] values for every combination of cell lines and drugs. Then a threshold IC[Formula: see text] value is obtained for each drug by performing K-means clustering of their known IC[Formula: see text] values. Finally- with the help of this threshold value- cell lines are classified as either sensitive or resistant to each drug. Results: Experimental results indicate that AGCN has an accuracy of 0.82 and performs better than many existing methods. In addition to that- we have done external validation of AGCN using data taken from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) clinical database- and we got an accuracy of 0.91. Conclusion: According to the results obtained- concatenating multi-omics data with drug structure data using AGCN for drug response prediction tasks greatly improves the accuracy of the prediction task.
Marisca Evalina Gondokesumo- Muhammad Rezki Rasyak,In-silico prediction of anti-breast cancer activity of ginger (Zingiber officinale) using machine learning techniques,The study focuses on enhancing breast cancer (BC) prognosis through early detection- aiming to establish a non-invasive- clinically viable BC screening method using specific serum miRNA levels. Involving 11-349 participants across BC- 11 other cancer types- and control groups- the study identified serum biomarkers through feature selection and developed two BC screening models using six machine learning algorithms. These models underwent evaluation across test- internal- and external validation sets- assessing performance metrics like accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- and the area under the curve (AUC). Subgroup analysis was conducted to test model stability. Based on the three serum miRNA biomarkers (miR-1307-3p- miR-5100- and miR-4745-5p)- a BC screening model- SM4BC3miR model- was developed. This model achieved AUC performances of 0.986- 0.986- and 0.939 on the test- internal- and external sets- respectively. Furthermore- the SSM4BC model- utilizing ratio scores of miR-1307-3p/miR-5100 and miR-4745-5p/miR-5100- showed AUCs of 0.973- 0.980- and 0.953- respectively. Subgroup analyses underscored both models' robustness and stability. This research introduced the SM4BC3miR and SSM4BC models- leveraging three specific serum miRNA biomarkers for breast cancer screening. Demonstrating high accuracy and stability- these models present a promising approach for early detection of breast cancer. However- their practical application and effectiveness in clinical settings remain to be further validated.

Chromogenic RNAscope staining is easy to fit into existing pathology workflows- but manually analyzing the resulting tissue samples is time consuming. There is also a lack of peer-reviewed- performant solutions for automated analysis of chromogenic RNAscope staining. This paper covers the development and optimization of a novel deep learning method focused on accurate segmentation of RNAscope dots (which signify gene expression) from breast cancer tissue. The deep learning network is convolutional and uses ConvNeXt as its backbone. The upscaling portions of the network use custom- heavily regularized blocks to prevent overfitting and early convergence on suboptimal solutions. The resulting network is modest in size for a segmentation network and able to function well with little training data. This deep learning network was also able to outperform manual expert annotation at finding the positions of RNAscope dots- having a final F1 -score of 0.745. In comparison- the expert inter-rater F1 -score was 0.596.

This study involved a retrospective analysis of 120 breast cancer patients treated with VMAT at Kaohsiung Veterans General Hospital from 2018 to 2023. Patient data included CT images- radiation doses- Dose-Volume Histogram (DVH) data- and clinical information. Using a Treatment Planning System (TPS)- we segmented CT images into Regions of Interest (ROIs) to extract radiomic and dosiomic features- focusing on intensity- shape- texture- and dose distribution characteristics. Features significantly associated with the development of RD were identified using ANOVA and LASSO regression (p-valueâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05). These features were then employed to train and evaluate Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF) models- using tenfold cross-validation to ensure robust assessment of model efficacy. In this study- 102 out of 120 VMAT-treated breast cancer patients were included in the detailed analysis. Thirty-two percent of these patients developed Grade 2+ RD. Age and BMI were identified as significant clinical predictors. Through feature selection- we narrowed down the vast pool of radiomic and dosiomic data to 689 features- distributed across 10 feature subsets for model construction. In the LR model- the J subset- comprising DVH- Radiomics- and Dosiomics features- demonstrated the highest predictive performance with an AUC of 0.82. The RF model showed that subset I- which includes clinical- radiomic- and dosiomic features- achieved the best predictive accuracy with an AUC of 0.83. These results emphasize that integrating radiomic and dosiomic features significantly enhances the prediction of Grade 2+ RD. Integrating clinical- radiomic- and dosiomic characteristics into AI models significantly improves the prediction of Grade 2+ RD risk in breast cancer patients post-VMAT. The RF model analysis demonstrates that a comprehensive feature set maximizes predictive efficacy- marking a promising step towards utilizing AI in radiation therapy risk assessment and enhancing patient care outcomes.

P Manju Bala- U Palani,Innovative breast cancer detection using a segmentation-guided ensemble classification framework,Breast cancer is a type of cancer that forms in the cells of the breasts. It can occur in both men and women- but it is far more common in women with an increase likelihood of development caused by some risk factors like age- family history- gene mutations- hormonal factors- and exposure to estrogen. There are several essential methods for early diagnostic and detection- like regular breast self-examinations- clinical breast examination mammograms- etc. Breast cancer detection faces several challenges that span various stages from screening to diagnosis. It is in the light of these- that the drive to overcome these challenges faced by patients and medical experts to get timely diagnosis or detection of breast cancer that motivated this research. The work aims at developing an intelligent-based system for the early detection of breast cancer driven by machine learning algorithm using features obtained from a digitized image of the Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of breast mass. The Machine learning algorithm used was the Support Vector Machine (SVM) and was apply to the Breast Cancer dataset. Additionally- feature selection and a neural network model was applied to improve the performance of the system. This work demonstrates that SVM algorithm can be used to enhance the early detection of breast cancer. Compared with the 92% accuracy of mammography- this machine learning model achieved a higher accuracy of around 98.18% for breast cancer detection and diagnosis based on the dataset that was used.
Sameet Sreenivasan- Chao Fang- Emuella M Flood- Natasha Markuzon- Jasmine Y Y Sze,Insights Into the Patient Experience of Hormone Therapy for Early Breast Cancer Treatment Using Patient Forum Discussions and Natural Language Processing,Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. The therapy used and its success depend highly on the histology of the tumor. This study aimed to explore the potential of predicting the molecular subtype of breast cancer using radiomic features extracted from screening digital mammography (DM) images. A retrospective study was performed using the OPTIMAM Mammography Image Database (OMI-DB). Four binary classification tasks were performed: luminal A vs. non-luminal A- luminal B vs. non-luminal B- TNBC vs. non-TNBC- and HER2 vs. non-HER2. Feature selection was carried out by Pearson correlation and LASSO. The support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) ML classifiers were used- and their performance was evaluated with the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A total of 186 patients were included in the study: 58 luminal A- 35 luminal B- 52 TNBC- and 41 HER2. The SVM classifier resulted in AUCs during testing of 0.855 for luminal A- 0.812 for luminal B- 0.789 for TNBC- and 0.755 for HER2- respectively. The NB classifier showed AUCs during testing of 0.714 for luminal A- 0.746 for luminal B- 0.593 for TNBC- and 0.714 for HER2. The SVM classifier outperformed NB with statistical significance for luminal A (p = 0.0268) and TNBC (p = 0.0073). Our study showed the potential of radiomics for non-invasive breast cancer subtype classification.
Huiyan Ying- Weikaixin Kong- Xiangwei Xu,Integrated Network Pharmacology- Machine Learning and Experimental Validation to Identify the Key Targets and Compounds of TiaoShenGongJian for the Treatment of Breast Cancer,The primary objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning-based approach capable of predicting the treatment response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to enhance breast cancer treatment management. The proposed system aims to predict NAC outcomes across three categories: pathological complete response (CR)- partial response (PR)- and stable disease (SD)- by analyzing multimodal magnetic resonance images with clinical and molecular subtype markers. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our system design- texture radiomics were extracted from T1- T2- and STIR MRI modalities- along with functional radiomics from diffusion-weighted MRI at various b-values. The main rationale behind employing multiple b-values in collecting DW-MRI is to effectively capture the complexities of blood diffusion within the tumor microstructure. The proposed system comprises several key steps: (i) extracting texture and functional radiomics from T1- T2- STIR MRI- and DW-MRI data; (ii) identifying the most significant radiomics correlated with NAC treatment using a genetic algorithm; (iii) initially predicting the PR from alternative treatment responses utilizing the extracted textures and functional radiomics; and (iv) subsequently integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with imaging radiomics to differentiate between CR and SD. Our proposed system is trained and validated through the utilization of a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approach on various MRI scans from 109 subjects- of whom 27 had complete responses- 54 had partial responses- and 28 had no responses. The performance of the proposed system was assessed through the utilization of Cohenâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s Kappa and accuracy metrics- achieving 81.31% and 88.07%- respectively.

Approximately 2.3 million cases are diagnosed annually. If it is detected at an early stage- the rate of survival is significantly improved; therefore- there is an urgent need for techniques that can be used for its effective diagnosis. Method The study aimed to present a hybrid model for breast cancer classification by employing DenseNet201 as a feature extractor and Bayesian-Optimized Fast Learning Network (FLN) as a classifier. The pre-trained DenseNet201 extracts high-quality features from breast ultrasound images on large datasets- which get classified through an FLN optimized using Bayesian techniques for hyperparameter tuning. Results The model performed well by achieving an accuracy of 96.79%- 94.71% F1 score- 96.81% precision- and 93.48% recall- while the AUC for benign- malignant- and normal cases was found to be 0.96- 0.95- and 0.98- respectively. Cross-entropy loss metrics further validated the model on its robust training and validation. Conclusion There is a great potential that this proposed model could enhance breast cancer diagnosis. This indeed is a reliable and efficient clinical solution for application.</p>

We propose deep learning techniques along with image processing for the detection of tumors. The availability of online datasets and advances in graphical processing units (GPU) have promoted the application of deep learning models for the detection of breast cancer. In this paper- deep learning models using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been built to automatically classify mammograms into benign and malignant. Issues like overfitting and dataset imbalance are overcome. Experimentation has been done on two publicly available datasets- namely mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) database and digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Robustness of the models is accomplished by merging the datasets. In our experimentation- MatConvNet has achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on the merged dataset- performing the best amongst all the CNN models used individually. Hungarian optimization algorithm is employed for selection of individual CNN models to form an ensemble. Ensemble of CNN models led to an improved performance- resulting in an accuracy of 95.7%.
Guihai Pan- Zejun Pan- Wubiao Chen- Yongjun Wu- Xiaoqing Di- Fei Zhou- Yuting Liao,Integration of MRI radiomics and clinical data for preoperative prediction of vascular invasion in breast cancer: A deep learning approach,Medical imaging diagnosis increasingly relies on Machine Learning (ML) models. This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets- where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability- which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models- the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique- STEM- can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)- Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN)- and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.
Haihong Hu- Hongxia Zhu- Wendi Zhan- Bo Hao- Ting Yan- Jingdi Zhang- Siyu Wang- Xuefeng Xu- Taolan Zhang,Integration of multiomics analyses reveals unique insights into CD24-mediated immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment of breast cancer,Cancer-related cognitive impairment is a significant clinical challenge observed in patients with breast cancer- manifesting during or after treatment. This impairment leads to deteriorations in memory- processing speed- attention- and executive functioning- which profoundly impact patients' occupational performance- daily living activities- and overall quality of life. Grounded in the Symptom Science Model 2.0- this study investigates the contributing factors to Cancer-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients and develops a predictive nomogram for this demographic. Employing both univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses- this investigation delineates the predictive factors influencing outcomes in breast cancer patients. A nomogram was constructed leveraging these identified predictive factors- accompanied by internal validation through bootstrap resampling methodology (1000 bootstrap samples). The efficacy of the predictive model was assessed by employing the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and calibration curves. The prevalence of cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients was identified to be 45.83%.Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified the independent predictors of Cancer-related cognitive impairment in breast cancer patients as place of residence- educational level- chemotherapy- benefit finding- post-traumatic growth- anxiety- fear of cancer progression- and fasting blood glucose levels. these factors were integrated into the nomogram. The Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrated that the prediction model was appropriately calibrated (â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšÂ¨â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬âˆž2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢11.520- Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.174).

This study analyzed 340 breast masses identified through ultrasound in 308 patients. The masses were divided into training (n = 260) and validation (n = 80) groups. The AI-based analysis employed the Samsung Ultrasound AI system (S-detect). Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to construct nomograms using logistic regression. The AI-Nomogram was based solely on AI results- while the ClinAI- Nomogram incorporated additional clinical factors. Both nomograms underwent internal validation with 1000 bootstrap resamples and external validation using the independent validation group. Performance was evaluated by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) and calibration curves. The ClinAI-Nomogram- which incorporates patient age- AI-based mass size- and AI-based diagnosis- outperformed an existing AI-Nomogram in differentiating benign from malignant breast masses. The ClinAI-Nomogram surpassed the AI-Nomogram in predicting malignancy with significantly higher AUC scores in both training (0.873- 95% CI: 0.830-0.917 vs. 0.792- 95% CI: 0.748-0.836; p = 0.016) and validation phases (0.847- 95% CI: 0.763-0.932 vs. 0.770- 95% CI: 0.709-0.833; p < 0.001). Calibration curves further revealed excellent agreement between the ClinAI-Nomogram's predicted probabilities and actual observed risks of malignancy. The ClinAI- Nomogram- combining AI alongside clinical data- significantly enhanced the differentiation of benign and malignant breast masses in clinical AI-facilitated ultrasound examinations.

Ayman Alsabry- Malek Algabri,Iterative Tuning of Tree-Ensemble-Based Models' parameters Using Bayesian Optimization for Breast Cancer Prediction,Breast cancer- a widespread malignancy predominantly affecting women aged 40 and above- presents a significant global health challenge with high mortality rates. The scarcity of medical data underscores the need for collaborative efforts among hospitals to enhance automated breast cancer detection. This research employs decentralized Federated Learning (FL) to facilitate cooperative learning across an interconnected smart hospital network- addressing data privacy- regulatory compliance- voluminous medical image data- and the necessity for distributed machine learning. Our innovative approach integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for hyperparameter fine-tuning and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in a collaborative framework for smart hospitals linked with decentralized edge intelligent networks. This optimization strategy significantly improves the performance of our breast cancer detection system. Through a comprehensive experimental study (including diverse datasets)- we classify Normal vs. Mass and Benign vs. Malignant regions in mammograms within a decentralized- federated collaborative learning environment. Empirical results consistently highlight the superiority of models trained using our method over individual hospital client-level training. Our method yielded significant improvements across evaluation measures: for Normal vs. Mass- achieving 92.6% sensitivity- 93.0% specificity- and 93.0% accuracy; for Benign vs. Malignant- achieving 89.6% sensitivity- 91.6% specificity- and 89.7% accuracy. Moreover- it has obtained a 6% and 5% increase in accuracy for Normal vs. Mass and Benign vs. Malignant cases- respectively- compared to the PSO-based HPO method. This evidence underscores the potential of collaborative approaches- emphasizing decentralized FL as a robust paradigm in medical research. The incorporation of ACO optimization reinforces the effectiveness of the proposed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system- marking a noteworthy advancement in the ongoing fight against breast cancer.
Fanli Qu- Guanwen Wang- Ping Wen- Xiaoyu Liu- Xiaohua Zeng,Knowledge mapping of immunotherapy for breast cancer: A bibliometric analysis from 2013 to 2022,The goal is to use three different machine learning models to predict the recurrence of breast cancer across a very heterogeneous sample of patients with varying disease kinds and stages. A heterogeneous group of patients with varying cancer kinds and stages- including both triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and non-triple-negative breast cancer (non-TNBC)- was examined. Three distinct models were created using the following five machine learning techniques: Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)- Random Under-sampling Boosting (RUSBoost)- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)- support vector machines (SVM)- and Logistic Regression. The clinical model used both clinical and pathology data in conjunction with the machine learning algorithms. The machine learning algorithms were combined with dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) imaging characteristics in the radiomic model- and the merged model combined the two types of data. Each technique was evaluated using several criteria- including the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve- precision- recall- and F1 score. The results suggest that the integration of clinical and radiomic data improves the predictive accuracy in identifying instances of breast cancer recurrence. The XGBoost algorithm is widely recognized as the most effective algorithm in terms of performance. The findings presented in this study offer significant contributions to the field of breast cancer research- particularly in relation to the prediction of cancer recurrence. These insights hold great potential for informing future investigations and clinical interventions that seek to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of recurrence prediction in breast cancer patients.

A total of 378 patients with invasive BC confirmed by pathological results were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Radiomics features were extracted guided by the BI-RADS lexicon from the regions of interest(ROIs) segmented with deep learning models. After features selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO) regression- four machine learning classifiers were used to establish the radiomics signature(Rad-score). Then- the integrated model was developed on the basis of the best Rad-score incorporating the independent clinical factors for TILs levels prediction. Tumors were segmented using the deep learning models with accuracy of 97.2%- sensitivity of 93.4%- specificity of 98.1%- and the posterior areas were also obtained. Eighteen morphology and texture related features were extracted from the ROIs and fourteen features were selected to construct the Rad-score models. Combined with independent clinical characteristics- the integrated model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889(95% CI-0.739-0.990) in the validation cohort and outperformed the traditional radiomics model with AUC of 0.756(0.649-0862) depended on hundreds of feature items. This study established a promising model for TILs levels prediction with numerable interpretable features and showed great potential to help decision-making and clinical applications. Imaging-based biomarkers has provides non-invasive ways for TILs levels evaluation in BC. Our model combining the BI-RADS guided radiomics features and clinical data outperformed the traditional radiomics approaches.
Parisa Shahnazari- Kaveh Kavousi- Zarrin Minuchehr- Bahram Goliaei- Reza M Salek,Leveraging ML for profiling lipidomic alterations in breast cancer tissues: a methodological perspective,Breast cancer (BC) is caused by the uncontrolled proliferation of breast epithelial cells followed by malignant transformation- and it has the highest incidence among female malignant tumors. The metastasis of BC occurs through direct and lymphatic spread. Although ocular metastasis is relatively rare- it is a good indicator of a worse prognosis. We used machine learning (ML) to establish a model to analyze the risk factors of BC eye metastasis. The clinical data of 2225 patients with BC from 2003 to 2019 were collected and randomly classified into the training and test sets using a ratio of 7:3. Based on the presence or absence of eye metastasis- the patients with BC were classified into the ocular metastasis (OM) and non-ocular metastasis (NOM) groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were conducted. We used six ML algorithms to establish a predictive BC model and used 10-fold cross-validation for internal verification. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the model. In addition- we established a web hazard calculator depending on the best-performing model to facilitate its clinical application. Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) was used to determine the risk factors and the interpretability of the black box model. Univariate logistic regression analysis showed that histopathology (other types)- axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) (>â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢4)- Ca2+- total cholesterol (TC)- low-density lipoprotein (LDL)- apolipoprotein A (ApoA)- carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)- carbohydrate antigen (CA) 125- CA153- CA199- alkaline phosphatase (ALP)- and hemoglobin (Hb) were risk factors for BC eye metastasis. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CA153- ApoA- and LDL were hazardous components for BC eye metastasis. LASSO showed that ALNM- LDL- CA125- Hb- ALP- and CA199 were the first six key variables that were useful for the diagnosis of ocular metastasis in breast cancer. Bootstrapped aggregation (BAG) demonstrated the discriminative ability (area under ROC curve [AUC]â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.992- accuracyâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.953- sensitivityâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.987). Based on this- we applied the BAG machine learning model to build an online web computing system to help clinicians assist in determining the risk of BC eye metastasis. In addition- two typical cases are analyzed to determine the interpretability of the model. We used ML to establish a risk prediction model for BC ocular metastasis- and BAG showed the greatest performance. The model can predict the risk of OM in patients with BC- facilitate early and timely diagnosis and treatment- and reduce the burden on society.

Please note that during production of the final copyedited article- errors may be discovered which could affect the content. Purpose To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) for diagnosis of breast cancer in digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) and investigate whether it could improve diagnostic accuracy and reduce reading time of radiologists. Materials and methods A deep learning AI algorithm was developed and validated for DBT with retrospectively collected examinations (January 2010 to December 2021) from 14 institutions in the United States and South Korea. A multicenter- reader study was performed to compare the performance of 15 radiologists (7 breast specialists- 8 general radiologists) in interpreting DBT examinations from 258 women (mean- 56 years Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 13.41 [SD])- including 65 cancer cases- with and without the use of AI. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)- sensitivity- specificity- and reading time were evaluated. Results The AUC for standalone AI performance was 0.93 (95% CI: 0.92-0.94). With AI- radiologists' AUC improved from 0.90 (0.86- 0.93) to 0.92 (0.88- 0.96; P = .003) in the reader study. AI showed higher specificity (89.64% (85.34- 93.94)) than radiologists (77.34% (75.82- 78.87; P < .001)). When reading with AI- radiologists' sensitivity increased from 85.44% (83.22- 87.65) to 87.69% (85.63- 89.75; P = .04)- with no evidence of a difference in specificity. Reading time decreased from 54.41 seconds (52.56- 56.27) without AI to 48.52 seconds (46.79- 50.25) with AI (P < .001). Interreader agreement measured by Fleiss kappa increased from 0.59 to 0.62- respectively. Conclusion The AI model showed better diagnostic accuracy than radiologists in breast cancer detection and reduced reading times. The concurrent use of AI in DBT interpretation could improve both accuracy and efficiency. Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â©RSNA- 2024."

Xiao Guo- Jiaying Xing- Yuyan Cao- Wenchuang Yang- Xinlin Shi- Runhong Mu- Tao Wang,Machine learning based anoikis signature predicts personalized treatment strategy of breast cancer,The vision transformer (ViT) architecture- with its attention mechanism based on multi-head attention layers- has been widely adopted in various computer-aided diagnosis tasks due to its effectiveness in processing medical image information. ViTs are notably recognized for their complex architecture- which requires high-performance GPUs or CPUs for efficient model training and deployment in real-world medical diagnostic devices. This renders them more intricate than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This difficulty is also challenging in the context of histopathology image analysis- where the images are both limited and complex. In response to these challenges- this study proposes a TokenMixer hybrid-architecture that combines the strengths of CNNs and ViTs. This hybrid architecture aims to enhance feature extraction and classification accuracy with shorter training time and fewer parameters by minimizing the number of input patches employed during training- while incorporating tokenization of input patches using convolutional layers and encoder transformer layers to process patches across all network layers for fast and accurate breast cancer tumor subtype classification. The TokenMixer mechanism is inspired by the ConvMixer and TokenLearner models. First- the ConvMixer model dynamically generates spatial attention maps using convolutional layers- enabling the extraction of patches from input images to minimize the number of input patches used in training. Second- the TokenLearner model extracts relevant regions from the selected input patches- tokenizes them to improve feature extraction- and trains all tokenized patches in an encoder transformer network. We evaluated the TokenMixer model on the BreakHis public dataset- comparing it with ViT-based and other state-of-the-art methods. Our approach achieved impressive results for both binary and multi-classification of breast cancer subtypes across various magnification levels (40â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢- 100â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢- 200â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢- 400â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢).

Dengke Jiang- Qiuqin Qian- Xiuqi Yang- Ying Zeng- Haibo Liu,Machine learning based on optimal VOI of multi-sequence MR images to predict lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer,Breast cancer remains to be the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide thereby highlighting the critical need to find superior treatment strategies for this disease. In the current era of cancer treatment- personalized medicine is garnering much attention as this type of treatment is more selective thereby minimizing harmful side effects. Personalized medicine is dependent upon knowing the underlying genetic landscape of the initial tumor. In our study- we focused our efforts on a specific subset of breast cancer that harbors genetic alterations in the Mediator subunit 12 (MED12). Our results show that loss of MED12 leads to enhanced cellular proliferation and colony formation of breast cancer cells through a mechanism that involves activation of GLI3-dependent SHH signaling- a pathway that is central to breast development and homeostasis. To find a personalized treatment option for this subset of breast cancer- we employed a natural compound screening strategy which uncovered a total of ten compounds that selectively target MED12 knockdown breast cancer cells. Our results show that two of these ten compounds- solasonine and alisol B23-acetate- block GLI3-dependent SHH signaling which leads to a reversal of enhanced cellular proliferation and colony formation ability. Thus- our findings provide promising insight into a novel personalized treatment strategy for patients suffering from MED12-altered breast cancer.
Amin Talebi- Ahmad Bitarafan-Rajabi- Azin Alizadeh-Asl- Parisa Seilani- Benyamin Khajetash- Ghasem Hajianfar- Meysam Tavakoli,Machine learning based radiomics model to predict radiotherapy induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer,The survival rate of breast cancer for women in low- and middle-income countries is poor compared with that in high-income countries. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) combined with deep learning could potentially be a suitable solution enabling early detection of breast cancer. We aim to improve a classification network dedicated to classifying POCUS images by comparing different techniques for increasing the amount of training data. Two data sets consisting of breast tissue images were collected- one captured with POCUS and another with standard ultrasound (US). The data sets were expanded by using different techniques- including augmentation- histogram matching- histogram equalization- and cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGANs). A classification network was trained on different combinations of the original and expanded data sets. Different types of augmentation were investigated and two different CycleGAN approaches were implemented. Almost all methods for expanding the data sets significantly improved the classification results compared with solely using POCUS images during the training of the classification network. When training the classification network on POCUS and CycleGAN-generated POCUS images- it was possible to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95.3% (95% confidence interval 93.4% to 97.0%). Applying augmentation during training showed to be important and increased the performance of the classification network. Adding more data also increased the performance- but using standard US images or CycleGAN-generated POCUS images gave similar results.
Yu Du- Xuehong Diao,Machine Learning Models for Predicting Clinically and Ultrasound-Negative Axillary Lymph Node Metastasis in Early-Stage Breast Cancer,Breast cancer poses a serious threat to women's life and health. Typically- radiologists can detect early signs of breast cancer activity through breast ultrasound. However- the interpretation of breast ultrasound is time-consuming and requires physicians to possess extensive diagnostic experience. In recent years- computer aided diagnostic (CAD) technology has been introduced into breast imaging diagnosis- saving a significant amount of time for expert medical image inspection and improving diagnostic efficiency. However- current research on computer-aided diagnostic methods has mainly focused on ultrasound (US) images- with limited studies on contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) videos. To solve this challenge- we collected 332 cases of breast cancer contrast-enhanced ultrasound videos from Shengjing Hospital. We designed ResViT by combining residual neural networks with Vision Transformer to extract spatial features- and used the Temporal Segment Network (TSN) in combination with linear weights to fuse the spatio-temporal features of each frame into video-level features for classification. The experiment results show that our model achieved an accuracy of 78.79% and a sensitivity of 85% in our dataset- significantly higher than the results of current mainstream video analysis networks- proving the effectiveness of our proposed model in the task of classifying contrast-enhanced ultrasound videos.

Kong- Minjiang Chen- Min Xu- Zhiyi Peng- Jiansong Ji,Machine Learning Radiomics-Based Prediction of Non-sentinel Lymph Node Metastasis in Chinese Breast Cancer Patients with 1-2 Positive Sentinel Lymph Nodes: A Multicenter Study.,Breast cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors in women- and accurate classification of benign and malignant breast cancer histopathology images is critical for diagnosis and treatment. Knowledge distillation techniques have recently received considerable attention for enabling cost-effective image classification of breast cancer histopathology images. However- there are still challenges- including the inefficient extraction of global and local features from breast cancer histopathology images by the teacher network- and the over-prioritization of feature fusion within the same encoder layer- which tends to neglect valuable information from adjacent encoder layers during knowledge extraction. To address these challenges- we propose a method that combines multi-view augmented contrastive learning and pre-learning knowledge distillation. Multi-view augmented contrastive learning improves the ability of the teacher network to extract global and local features. Pre-learning knowledge distillation merges features from adjacent encoder layers of the teacher network- reducing feature loss between these layers. Empirical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in classifying histopathology images of benign and malignant breast cancer- achieving excellent results on the BreakHis dataset. These results confirm our method as an effective tool for the classification of benign and malignant breast cancer histopathology images.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) AI model- pre-trained on breast MRI data- was fine-tuned using a retrospective dataset of 3029 MRI scans from 910 patients. These contained 115 cancers that were diagnosed within one year of a negative MRI. The model aimed to identify these cancers- with the goal of predicting cancer development up to one year in advance. The network was fine-tuned and tested with 10-fold cross-validation. Mean age of patients was 52 years (range- 18-88 years)- with average follow-up of 4.3 years (range 1-12 years). The AI detected cancers one year earlier with an area under the ROC curve of 0.72 (0.67-0.76). Retrospective analysis by a radiologist of the top 10% highest risk MRIs as ranked by the AI could have increased early detection by up to 30%. (35/115- CI:22.2-39.7%- 30% sensitivity). A radiologist identified a visual correlate to biopsy-proven cancers in 83 of prior-year MRIs (83/115- CI: 62.1-79.4%). The AI algorithm identified the anatomic region where cancer would be detected in 66 cases (66/115- CI:47.8-66.5%); with both agreeing in 54 cases (54/115- CI:%37.5-56.4%). This novel AI-aided re-evaluation of ""benign"" breasts shows promise for improving early breast cancer detection with MRI.

To improve interobserver agreement- regulatory science experts at the US Food and Drug Administration partnered with academic pathologists internationally to create a freely available online continuing medical education (CME) course to train pathologists in assessing breast cancer stromal TILs using an interactive format with expert commentary. Here we describe and provide a user guide to this CME course- whose content was designed to improve pathologist accuracy in scoring breast cancer TILs. We also suggest subsequent steps to translate knowledge into clinical practice with proficiency testing.
Paidipati Dinesh- A. S. Vickram- P. Kalyanasundaram,Medical image prediction for diagnosis of breast cancer disease comparing the machine learning algorithms: SVM- KNN- logistic regression- random forest and decision tree to measure accuracy,Breast cancer is the most fatal womenâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s cancer- and accurate diagnosis of this disease in the initial phase is crucial to abate death rates worldwide. The demand for computer-aided disease diagnosis technologies in healthcare is growing significantly to assist physicians in ensuring the effectual treatment of critical diseases. The vital purpose of this study is to analyze and evaluate the classification efficiency of several machine learning algorithms with hyperparameter optimization techniques using grid search and random search to reveal an efficient breast cancer diagnosis approach. Choosing the optimal combination of hyperparameters using hyperparameter optimization for machine learning models has a straight influence on the performance of models. According to the findings of several evaluation studies- the k-nearest neighbor is addressed in this study for effective diagnosis of breast cancer- which got a 100.00% recall value with hyperparameters found utilizing grid search. k-nearest neighbor- logistic regression- and multilayer perceptron obtained 99.42% accuracy after utilizing hyperparameter optimization. All machine learning models showed higher efficiency in breast cancer diagnosis with grid search-based hyperparameter optimization except for XGBoost. Therefore- the evaluation outcomes strongly validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed technique for breast cancer diagnosis.
L. R. Sujithra- V. Praveena- S. Karthik- M. S. Kavitha,Membership Weight Salp Swarm Algorithm (MWSSA) based feature selection and deep learning approach for breast cancer classification of SNP genomics data,AIM To explore the actual experience of psychological distress of adult women of reproductive age at different stages after breast cancer diagnosis. DESIGN Qualitative. METHODS Eighty-one patients with breast cancer-related distress thermometer scores >4 were selected using a purposive sampling method. Patients were divided into newly diagnosed and 1-- 3-- 6-- 9- and 12-month groups according to time since diagnosis and then interviewed. A phenomenological approach was adopted to analyse interview content- and different themes were extracted. RESULTS Women exhibited different levels of psychological distress depending on the time since diagnosis- with newly diagnosed patients showing the highest distress. Within 1â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢year post-diagnosis- different events caused patients distress. Themes extracted at new diagnosis and 1-- 3-- 6-- 9- and 12â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢months post-diagnosis included sadness and disbelief- loss of control- optimistic but concerned- physical and mental exhaustion- difficulties returning to society and limited sexual intimacy- respectively; all groups expressed reproductive concerns. CONCLUSION Clinical nurses should focus on different psychologically distressing events to provide targeted interventions at distinct phases. For women of childbearing age- clinical nurses should pay particular attention to patients' marriage and reproductive concerns. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE PROFESSION AND/OR PATIENT CARE During the year after a breast cancer diagnosis- patients of childbearing age experience events that cause psychological distress that differ depending on time since diagnosis. Nurses should focus on core stressful events and perform specific nursing interventions. IMPACT To provide holistic care- nurses should consider the psychological and emotional changes patients may undergo. For women of childbearing age- clinical nurses should pay particular attention to patients' marriage and fertility concerns- and be able to provide evidence-based professional guidance on reproductive preservation techniques. REPORTING METHOD The study was reported using the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research guidelines.

Youzhao Ma- Jingyang Zhang- Dechuang Jiao- Xiuchun Chen- Zhenzhen Liu,Metabolic Syndrome Is Associated With Poor Prognosis in Patients With Breast Cancer Receiving Neoadjuvant Therapy,Doxorubicin (DOXO) is a primary treatment for breast cancer but can cause cardiotoxicity in over 25% of patients within the first year post-chemotherapy. Recognizing at-risk patients before DOXO initiation offers pathways for alternative treatments or early protective actions. We analyzed data from 78 Brazilian breast cancer patients- with 34.6% developing cardiotoxicity within a year of their final DOXO dose. To address the limited sample size- we utilized the DAS (Data Augmentation and Smoothing) method- creating 4892 synthetic samples that exhibited high statistics fidelity to the original data. By integrating routine blood biomarkers (C-Reactive protein- total cholesterol- LDL-c- HDL-c- hematocrit- and hemoglobin) and two clinical measures (weighted smoking status and body mass index)- our model achieved an AUROC of 0.85Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±0.10- a sensitivity of 0.89- and a specificity of 0.69- positioning it as a potential screening instrument. Notably- DAS outperformed the established methods- Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN)- Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE)- and Synthetic Data Vault (SDV)- underscoring its promise for medical synthetic data generation and pioneering a cardiotoxicity prediction model specifically for DOXO.

With most work done in non-human models and the heterogeneous nature of senescence- the precise role of senescent cells in the development of cancer in humans is not well understood. Furthermore- more than 1 million non-malignant breast biopsies are taken every year that could be a major resource for risk stratification. We aimed to explore the clinical relevance for breast cancer development of markers of senescence in mammary tissue from healthy female donors. In this retrospective cohort study- we applied single-cell deep learning senescence predictors- based on nuclear morphology- to histological images of haematoxylin and eosin-stained breast biopsy samples from healthy female donors at the Komen Tissue Bank (KTB) at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (Indianapolis- IN- USA). All KTB participants (aged â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢18 years) who underwent core biopsies for research purposes between 2009 and 2019 were eligible for the study. Senescence was predicted in the epithelial (terminal duct lobular units [TDLUs] and non-TDLU epithelium)- stromal- and adipose tissue compartments using validated models- previously trained on cells induced to senescence by ionising radiation (IR)- replicative exhaustion (or replicative senescence; RS)- or antimycin A- atazanavir-ritonavir- and doxorubicin (AAD) exposures. To benchmark our senescence-based cancer prediction results- we generated 5-year Gail scores-the current clinical gold standard for breast cancer risk prediction-for participants aged 35 years and older on the basis of characteristics at the time of tissue donation. The primary outcome was estimated odds of breast cancer via logistic modelling for each tissue compartment based on predicted senescence scores in cases (participants who had been diagnosed with breast cancer as of data cutoff- July 31- 2022) and controls (those who had not been diagnosed with breast cancer). 4382 female donors (median age at donation 45 years [IQR 34-57]) were eligible for the study. As of data cutoff (median follow-up of 10 years [7-11])- 86 (2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0%) had developed breast cancer a mean of 4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´8 years (SD 2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´84) after date of donation and 4296 (98Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0%) had not received a breast cancer diagnosis. Among the 86 cases- we found significant differences in adipose-specific IR and AAD senescence prediction scores compared with controls. Risk analysis showed that individuals in the upper half (above the median) of scores for the adipose tissue IR model had higher odds of developing breast cancer (odds ratio [OR] 1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´71 [95% CI 1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´10-2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´68]; p=0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´019)- whereas the adipose AAD model revealed a reduced odds of developing breast cancer (OR 0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´57 [0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´36-0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´88]; p=0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´013). For the other tissue compartments and the RS model- no significant associations were found (except for stromal tissue via the IR model- had higher odds of developing breast cancer [OR 1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´59- 1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´03-2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´49]). Individuals with both of the adipose risk factors had an OR of 3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´32 (1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´68-7Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´03; p=0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0009). Participants with 5-year Gail scores above the median had an OR for development of cancer of 2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´33 (1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´46-3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´82; p=0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0012) compared with those with scores below the median. When combining Gail scores with our adipose AAD risk model- we found that individuals with both of these predictors had an OR of 4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´70 (2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´29-10Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´90; p<0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0001). When combining the Gail score with our adipose IR model- we found that individuals with both predictors had an OR of 3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´45 (1Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´77-7Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´24; p=0Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšÂ´0002). Assessment of senescence-associated nuclear morphologies with deep learning allows prediction of future cancer risk from normal breast biopsy samples. The combination of multiple models improved prediction of future breast cancer compared with the current clinical benchmark- the Gail model. Our results suggest an important role for microscope image-based deep learning models in predicting future cancer development. Such models could be incorporated into current breast cancer risk assessment and screening protocols. Novo Nordisk Foundation- Danish Cancer Society- and the US National Institutes of Health.

Machine learning (ML) methods can help radiologists to diagnose breast cancer (BCs) barring invasive measures. Informative hand-crafted features are essential prerequisites for traditional machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate results- which are time-consuming to extract. In this paper- our deep learning algorithm is created to precisely identify breast cancers on screening mammograms- employing a training method that effectively utilizes training datasets with either full clinical annotation or solely the cancer status of the entire image. The proposed approach utilizes Lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (LWCNN) that allows automatic extraction features in an end-to-end manner. We have tested LWCNN model in two experiments. In the first experiment- the model was tested with two cases' original and enhancement datasets 1. It achieved 95Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- 93Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- 99Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % and 98Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for training and testing accuracy respectively. In the second experiment- the model has been tested with two cases' original and enhancement datasets 2. It achieved 95Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- 91Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- 99Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % and 92Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ % for training and testing accuracy respectively. Our proposed method- which uses various convolutional network to classify screening mammograms achieved exceptional performance when compared to other methods. The findings from these experiments clearly indicate that automatic deep learning techniques can be trained effectively to attain remarkable accuracy across a wide range of mammography datasets. This holds significant promise for improving clinical tools and reducing both false positive and false negative outcomes in screening mammography.

Utilizing a dataset of 5-339 mammograms from the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM)- the models were trained and tested on two classes: benign and malignant lesions. The mammograms underwent preprocessing techniques- including image quality assessment- contrast enhancement- and artifact removal- to ensure high-quality data for model training. The performance of each model was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- and ROC analysis. The results revealed that the EfficientNet model outperformed the other algorithms- achieving an accuracy of 95.23%- sensitivity of 96.67%- and specificity of 93.82%. In contrast- DenseNet exhibited the lowest performance- struggling with the correct classification of cancer cases. The comparative analysis highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each model- offering valuable insights into their potential clinical applications. This research underscores the importance of selecting the appropriate machine learning architecture to enhance the predictive accuracy of breast cancer detection and provides a foundation for integrating these models into clinical practice for personalized treatment planning. Future studies will focus on expanding the dataset and improving model generalizability to diverse patient populations.

Thus- early detection and treatment of cancer lead to a better outcome for the patient. Ultrasound (US) imaging plays a crucial role in the early detection of breast cancer- providing a cost-effective- convenient- and safe diagnostic approach. To date- much research has been conducted to facilitate reliable and effective early diagnosis of breast cancer through US image analysis. Recently- with the introduction of machine learning technologies such as deep learning (DL)- automated lesion segmentation and classification- the identification of malignant masses in US breasts has progressed- and computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technology is being applied in clinics effectively. Herein- we propose a novel deep learning-based ""segmentation + classification"" model based on B- and SE-mode images. For the segmentation task- we propose a Multi-Modal Fusion U-Net (MMF-U-Net)- which segments lesions by mixing B- and SE-mode information through fusion blocks. After segmenting- the lesion area from the B- and SE-mode images is cropped using a predicted segmentation mask. The encoder part of the pre-trained MMF-U-Net model is then used on the cropped B- and SE-mode breast US images to classify benign and malignant lesions. The experimental results using the proposed method showed good segmentation and classification scores. The dice score- intersection over union (IoU)- precision- and recall are 78.23%- 68.60%- 82.21%- and 80.58%- respectively- using the proposed MMF-U-Net on real-world clinical data. The classification accuracy is 98.46%. Our results show that the proposed method will effectively segment the breast lesion area and can reliably classify the benign from malignant lesions."

However- AI's black box nature hinders result acceptance. This study delves into Explainable AI (XAI) integration for breast cancer precision medicine recommendations. Transparent AI models- fuelled by patient data- enable personalized treatment recommendations. Techniques like feature analysis and decision trees enhance transparency- fostering trust between medical practitioners and patients. This harmonizes AI's potential with the imperative for clear medical decisions- propelling breast cancer care within the precision medicine era. This research work is dedicated to leveraging clinical and genomic data from samples of metastatic breast cancer. The primary aim is to develop a machine learning (ML) model capable of predicting optimal treatment approaches- including but not limited to hormonal therapy- chemotherapy- and anti-HER2 therapy. The objective is to enhance treatment selection by harnessing advanced computational techniques and comprehensive data analysis. A decision tree model developed here for the prediction of suitable personalized treatment for breast cancer patients achieves 99.87% overall prediction accuracy. Thus- the use of XAI in healthcare will build trust in doctors as well as patients.

Materials and Methods In this retrospective study- a biology-based mathematical model of tumor response to NAC was constructed and calibrated on a patient-specific basis using imaging data from patients enrolled in the MD Anderson A Robust TNBC Evaluation FraMework to Improve Survival trial (ARTEMIS; ClinicalTrials.gov registration no. NCT02276443) between April 2018 and May 2021. To relate the calibrated parameters in the biology-based model and pretreatment MRI data- a convolutional neural network (CNN) was employed. The CNN predictions of the calibrated model parameters were used to estimate tumor response at the end of NAC. CNN performance in the estimations of total tumor volume (TTV)- total tumor cellularity (TTC)- and tumor status was evaluated. Model-predicted TTC and TTV measurements were compared with MRI-based measurements using the concordance correlation coefficient and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (for predicting pathologic complete response at the end of NAC). Results The study included 118 female patients (median age- 51 years [range- 29-78 years]). For comparison of CNN predicted to measured change in TTC and TTV over the course of NAC- the concordance correlation coefficient values were 0.95 (95% CI: 0.90- 0.98) and 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87- 0.97)- respectively. CNN-predicted TTC and TTV had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.34- 0.94) and 0.72 (95% CI: 0.40- 0.95) for predicting tumor status at the time of surgery- respectively. Conclusion Deep learning integrated with a biology-based mathematical model showed good performance in predicting the spatial and temporal evolution of a patient's tumor during NAC using only pre-NAC MRI data.

Mustafa- Zana Baqi Najmalddin- Mohammed Fatih Rasul,Molecular Mechanisms of Breast Cancer Drug Resistance and CRISPR/Cas9 Strategies to Overcome,Introduction: As the evaluation indices- cancer grading and subtyping have diverse clinical- pathological- and molecular characteristics with prognostic and therapeutic implications. Although researchers have begun to study cancer differentiation and subtype prediction- most of relevant methods are based on traditional machine learning and rely on single omics data. It is necessary to explore a deep learning algorithm that integrates multi-omics data to achieve classification prediction of cancer differentiation and subtypes. Methods: This paper proposes a multi-omics data fusion algorithm based on a multi-view graph neural network (MVGNN) for predicting cancer differentiation and subtype classification. The model framework consists of a graph convolutional network (GCN) module for learning features from different omics data and an attention module for integrating multi-omics data. Three different types of omics data are used. For each type of omics data- feature selection is performed using methods such as the chi-square test and minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR). Weighted patient similarity networks are constructed based on the selected omics features- and GCN is trained using omics features and corresponding similarity networks. Finally- an attention module integrates different types of omics features and performs the final cancer classification prediction. Results: To validate the cancer classification predictive performance of the MVGNN model- we conducted experimental comparisons with traditional machine learning models and currently popular methods based on integrating multi-omics data using 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally- we performed comparative experiments on cancer differentiation and its subtypes based on single omics data- two omics data- and three omics data. Discussion: This paper proposed the MVGNN model and it performed well in cancer classification prediction based on multiple omics data.

Trust between health providers and patients has been shown to improve patient quality of life and may enhance clinical outcomes. This study aimed to explore the meaning of trust along the treatment pathway. The study followed a convergent mixed-methods design. We collected qualitative data longitudinally from diagnosis to follow-up using unstructured digital diaries and 45 semi-structured interviews with twelve women with breast cancer. To measure symptom burden and trust- we collected quantitative data by means of 57 questionnaires. Data analysis was based on phenomenology according to van Manen and on descriptive statistics. Data synthesis resulted in a conceptual model of trust. The women experienced trust as a dynamic phenomenon within the biomedical cancer care ""machinery"". Their trust was strongly influenced by contextual factors- professionals' expertise- and person-centeredness. The relevance of trust differed according to treatment phases. Due to a high degree of uncertainty- trust was particularly important. Professionals positively influenced the women's trust to a certain extent through a patient-centered approach and by demonstrating expertise within the biomedical cancer care ""machinery"". The conceptual model of trust should receive attention to bring care closer to the women's lived experience so that their care experience can be improved."

Non-invasive imaging methods- such as mammography and ultrasound- are critical for early detection- yet standalone modalities have limitations in regard to their diagnostic accuracy. This study aims to enhance breast cancer detection through a cross-modality fusion approach combining mammography and ultrasound imaging- using advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. Materials and Methods: Breast images were sourced from public datasets- including the RSNA- the PAS- and Kaggle- and categorized into malignant and benign groups. Data augmentation techniques were used to address imbalances in the ultrasound dataset. Three models were developed: (1) pre-trained CNNs integrated with machine learning classifiers- (2) transfer learning-based CNNs- and (3) a custom-designed 17-layer CNN for direct classification. The performance of the models was evaluated using metrics such as accuracy and the Kappa score. Results: The custom 17-layer CNN outperformed the other models- achieving an accuracy of 0.964 and a Kappa score of 0.927. The transfer learning model achieved moderate performance (accuracy 0.846- Kappa 0.694)- while the pre-trained CNNs with machine learning classifiers yielded the lowest results (accuracy 0.780- Kappa 0.559). Cross-modality fusion proved effective in leveraging the complementary strengths of mammography and ultrasound imaging. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the potential of cross-modality imaging and tailored CNN architectures to significantly improve diagnostic accuracy and reliability in breast cancer detection. The custom-designed model offers a practical solution for early detection- potentially reducing false positives and false negatives- and improving patient outcomes through timely and accurate diagnosis.

Cici Zhang- Minzhi Zhong- Zhiping Liang- Jing Zhou- Kejian Wang- Jun Bu,MRI-based radiomic and machine learning for prediction of lymphovascular invasion status in breast cancer,Early prediction of patient responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is essential for the precision treatment of early breast cancer (EBC). Therefore- this study aims to noninvasively and early predict pathological complete response (pCR). We used dynamic ultrasound (US) imaging changes acquired during NACT- along with clinicopathological features- to create a nomogram and construct a machine learning model. This retrospective study included 304 EBC patients recruited from multiple centers. All enrollees had completed NACT regimens- and underwent US examinations at baseline and at each NACT cycle. We subsequently determined that percentage reduction of tumor maximum diameter from baseline to third cycle of NACT serves to independent predictor for pCR- enabling creation of a nomogram ([Formula: see text]). Our predictive accuracy further improved ([Formula: see text]) by combining dynamic US data and clinicopathological features in a machine learning model. Such models may offer a means of accurately predicting NACT responses in this setting- helping to individualize patient therapy. Our study may provide additional insights into the US-based response prediction by focusing on the dynamic changes of the tumor in the early and full NACT cycle.

After data preprocessing and standardization, the performance of each model was comprehensively evaluated using classification and regression metrics. The results showed that the logistic regression model performed the best, with an accuracy of 0.9825, while SVM and random forest also showed good performance. The classification effects of each model were visualized through ROC curves and confusion matrices, demonstrating that logistic regression has high application value in breast cancer diagnosis."

The dynamic and transient nature of EMT-like processes challenges the investigation of cell plasticity in patient-derived breast cancer models. Here- we utilized patient-derived organoids (PDOs) as a model to study the susceptibility of primary breast cancer cells to EMT. Upon induction with TGF-â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸ- PDOs exhibited EMT-like features- including morphological changes- E-cadherin downregulation and cytoskeletal reorganization- leading to an invasive phenotype. Image analysis and the integration of deep learning algorithms enabled the implantation of microscopy-based quantifications demonstrating repetitive results between organoid lines from different breast cancer patients. Interestingly- epithelial plasticity was also expressed in terms of alterations in luminal and myoepithelial distribution upon TGF-â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÂ¢Â¬ÃŸ induction. The effective modeling of dynamic processes such as EMT in organoids and their characteristic spatial diversity highlight their potential to advance research on cancer cell plasticity in cancer patients.
Yini Li- Cao Li- Tao Yang- Lingzhi Chen- Mingquan Huang- Lu Yang- Shuxian Zhou- Huaqing Liu- Jizhu Xia- Shijie Wang,Multiview deep learning networks based on automated breast volume scanner images for identifying breast cancer in BI-RADS 4,Single-vesicle molecular profiling of cancer-associated extracellular vesicles (EVs) is increasingly being recognized as a powerful tool for cancer detection and monitoring. Mask and target dual imaging is a facile method to quantify the fraction of the molecularly targeted population of EVs in biofluids at the single-vesicle level. However- accurate and efficient dual imaging vesicle analysis has been challenging due to the interference of false signals on the mask images and the need to analyze a large number of images in clinical samples. In this work- we report a fully automatic dual imaging analysis method based on machine learning and use it with dual imaging single-vesicle technology (DISVT) to detect breast cancer at different stages. The convolutional neural network Resnet34 was used along with transfer learning to produce a suitable machine learning model that could accurately identify areas of interest in experimental data. A combination of experimental and synthetic data were used to train the model. Using DISVT and our machine learning-assisted image analysis platform- we determined the fractions of EpCAM-positive EVs and CD24-positive EVs over captured plasma EVs with CD81 marker in the blood plasma of pilot HER2-positive breast cancer patients and compared to those from healthy donors. The amount of both EpCAM-positive and CD24-positive EVs was found negligible for both healthy donors and Stage I patients. The amount of EpCAM-positive EVs (also CD81-positive) increased from 18% to 29% as the cancer progressed from Stage II to III. No significant increase was found with further progression to Stage IV. A similar trend was found for the CD24-positive EVs. Statistical analysis showed that both EpCAM and CD24 markers can detect HER2-positive breast cancer at Stages II- III- or IV. They can also differentiate individual cancer stages except those between Stage III and Stage IV. Due to the simplicity- high sensitivity- and high efficiency- the DISVT with the AI-assisted dual imaging analysis can be widely used for both basic research and clinical applications to quantitatively characterize molecularly targeted EV subtypes in biofluids.
Qiang Li- George Teodoro- Yi Jiang- Jun Kong,NACNet: A histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network for predicting treatment response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in Triple Negative Breast Cancer,Breast cancer is one of the most common causes of death in women in the modern world. Cancerous tissue detection in histopathological images relies on complex features related to tissue structure and staining properties. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models like ResNet50- Inception-V1- and VGG-16- while useful in many applications- cannot capture the patterns of cell layers and staining properties. Most previous approaches- such as stain normalization and instance-based vision transformers- either miss important features or do not process the whole image effectively. Therefore- a deep fusion-based vision Transformer model (DFViT) that combines CNNs and transformers for better feature extraction is proposed. DFViT captures local and global patterns more effectively by fusing RGB and stain-normalized images. Trained and tested on several datasets- such as BreakHis- breast cancer histology (BACH)- and UCSC cancer genomics (UC)- the results demonstrate outstanding accuracy- F1 score- precision- and recall- setting a new milestone in histopathological image analysis for diagnosing breast cancer.
Lipsa Leena Panigrahi- Pallavi Samal- Sameer Ranjan Sahoo- Banishree Sahoo- Arun Kumar Pradhan- Sailendra Mahanta- Sandip Kumar Rath- Manoranjan Arakha,Nanoparticle-mediated diagnosis- treatment- and prevention of breast cancer,"Several studies show that a significantly stronger association is obvious between increased body mass index (BMI) and higher breast cancer incidence. Additionally- obese and postmenopausal women are at higher risk of all-cause and breast cancer-specific mortality compared with non-obese women with breast cancer. In this context- increased levels of estrogens- excessive aromatization activity of the adipose tissue- overexpression of pro-inflammatory cytokines- insulin resistance- adipocyte-derived adipokines- hypercholesterolemia- and excessive oxidative stress contribute to the development of breast cancer in obese women. Genetic evaluation is an integral part of diagnosis and treatment for patients with breast cancer. Despite trimodality therapy- the four-year cumulative incidence of regional recurrence is significantly higher. Axillary lymph nodes as well as primary lesions have diagnostic- prognostic- and therapeutic significance for the management of breast cancer. In clinical setting- because of the obese population primary lesions and enlarged lymph nodes could be less palpable- the diagnosis may be challenging due to misinterpretation of physical findings. Thereby- a nomogram has been created as the ""Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System"" (BI-RADS) to increase agreement and decision-making consistency between mammography and ultrasonography (USG) experts. Additionally- the ""breast density classification system-"" ""artificial intelligence risk scores-"" ligand-targeted receptor probes-"" ""digital breast tomosynthesis-"" ""diffusion-weighted imaging-"" ""18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography-"" and ""dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)"" are important techniques for the earlier detection of breast cancers and to reduce false-positive results. A high concordance between estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) status evaluated in preoperative percutaneous core needle biopsy and surgical specimens is demonstrated. Breast cancer surgery has become increasingly conservative; however- mastectomy may be combined with any axillary procedures- such as sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) and/or axillary lymph node dissection whenever is required. As a rule- SLNB-guided axillary dissection in breast cancer patients who have clinically axillary lymph node-positive to node-negative conversion following neoadjuvant chemotherapy is recommended- because lymphedema is the most debilitating complication after any axillary surgery. There is no clear consensus on the optimal treatment of occult breast cancer- which is much discussed today. Similarly- the current trend in metastatic breast cancer is that the main palliative treatment option is systemic therapy."

Therefore- we established a multimodal deep learning model incorporating ultrasound (US) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images to predict ALN metastasis in patients with breast cancer. A retrospective cohort of patients with histologically confirmed breast cancer from two hospitals composed of the primary cohort (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 465) and the external validation cohort (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 123). All patients had undergone both preoperative US and MRI scans. After data preprocessing- three convolutional neural network models were used to analyze the US and MRI images- respectively. After integrating the US and MRI deep learning prediction results (DLUS and DLMRI- respectively)- a multimodal deep learning (DLMRI+US+Clinical parameter) model was constructed. The predictive ability of the proposed model was compared to that of the DLUS- DLMRI- combined bimodal (DLMRI+US)- and clinical parameter models. Evaluation was performed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) and decision curves. A total of 588 patients with breast cancer participated in this study. The DLMRI+US+Clinical parameter model outperformed the alternative models- achieving the highest AUCs of 0.819 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.734-0.903) and 0.809 (95% CI 0.723-0.895) on the internal and external validation sets- respectively. The decision curve analysis confirmed its clinical usefulness. The DLMRI+USâ€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ†Â¬Â¨â€šÃ Â´â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â£Clinical parameter model demonstrates the feasibility and reliability of its performance for ALN metastasis prediction in patients with breast cancer.
Qiwang Zhou- Xiaokang Gao- Hui Xu- Xuan Lu,Non-apoptotic regulatory cell death scoring system to predict the clinical outcome and drug choices in breast cancer,Given the long-term and severe distress experienced during breast cancer treatment- detecting depression among breast cancer patients is clinically crucial. This study aimed to explore a machine-learning model using self-report questionnaires to screen for depression in patients with breast cancer. A total of 327 patients who visited the breast cancer clinic were included in this study. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9)- Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)- and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The depression was evaluated according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th edition. The prediction model's performance based on supervised machine learning was conducted using MATLAB2022. The BDI showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.785 when using the logistic regression (LR) classifier. The HADS and PHQ-9 showed an AUC of 0.784 and 0.756 when using the linear discriminant analysis- respectively. The combinations of BDI and HADS showed an AUC of 0.812 when using the LR. The combinations of PHQ-9- BDI- and HADS showed an AUC of 0.807 when using LR. The combination model with BDI and HADS in breast cancer patients might be better than the method using a single scale. In future studies- it is necessary to explore strategies that can improve the performance of the model by integrating the method using questionnaires and other methods.

To address this- we developed deep-learning models using post-NAC dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and clinical data. A total of 852 women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive or triple-negative breast cancer were randomly divided into a training set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢724) and a validation set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢128). A 3D convolutional neural network model was trained on the training set and validated independently.

Vijayshri Chaurasia- Mamta Patankar- Madhu Shandilya- Vivek Patel- Ebtasam Ahmad Siddiqui- Laxmi Kumre,Nucleion Segmentation for Breast Cancer Classification,Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world- especially among women. Breast tumor segmentation is a key step in the identification and localization of the breast tumor region- which has important clinical significance. Inspired by the swin-transformer model with powerful global modeling ability- we propose a semantic segmentation framework named Swin-Net for breast ultrasound images- which combines Transformer and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to effectively improve the accuracy of breast ultrasound segmentation. Firstly- our model utilizes a swin-transformer encoder with stronger learning ability- which can extract features of images more precisely. In addition- two new modules are introduced in our method- including the feature refinement and enhancement module (RLM) and the hierarchical multi-scale feature fusion module (HFM)- given that the influence of ultrasonic image acquisition methods and the characteristics of tumor lesions is difficult to capture. Among them- the RLM module is used to further refine and enhance the feature map learned by the transformer encoder. The HFM module is used to process multi-scale high-level semantic features and low-level details- so as to achieve effective cross-layer feature fusion- suppress noise- and improve model segmentation performance. Experimental results show that Swin-Net performs significantly better than the most advanced methods on the two public benchmark datasets. In particular- it achieves an absolute improvement of 1.4â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®1.8% on Dice. Additionally- we provide a new dataset of breast ultrasound images on which we test the effect of our model- further demonstrating the validity of our method. In summary- the proposed Swin-Net framework makes significant advancements in breast ultrasound image segmentation- providing valuable exploration for research and applications in this domain.
Jung In Park- Steven Johnson- Lisiane Pruinelli,Optimizing pain management in breast cancer care: Utilizing 'All of Us' data and deep learning to identify patients at elevated risk for chronic pain,Segmentation is a technique for separating an image into discrete areas in order to separate objects of interest from their surroundings. In image analysis- segmentationâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃœwhich encompasses detection- feature extraction- classification- and treatmentâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃœis crucial. In order to plan treatments- segmentation aids doctors in measuring the amount of tissue in the breast. Categorizing the input data into two groups that are mutually exclusive is the aim of a binary classification problem. In this case- the training data is labeled in a binary format based on the problem being solved. Identifying breast lumps accurately in mammography pictures is essential for the purpose of prenatal testing for breast cancer. The proposed TLA (Transfer Learning Approach) based CNN (Convolution Neural Network) â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®TLA based CNN aims to offer binary classification for rapid and precise breast cancer diagnosis (benign and malignant). In order to predict the sub-type of cancer- this exploration as used Deep Learning techniques on the Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) - Feature extraction technique that creates a local histogram of the image to extract features from each place in the image with CNN classifier. This research work employs two well-known pre-trained models- ResNet-50 and VGG16- to extract characteristics from mammography images. The high-level features from the Mammogram dataset are extracted using a transfer learning model based on Visual Geometry Group (VGG) with 16-layer and Residual Neural Network with 50-layers deep model architecture (ResNet-50). The proposed model TLA based CNN has achieved 96.49% and 95.48% accuracy as compared to ResNet50 and VGG16 in the breast cancer classification and segmentation.
Giulia Lucrezia Baroni- Laura Rasotto- Kevin Roitero- Angelica Tulisso- Carla Di Loreto- Vincenzo Della Mea,Optimizing Vision Transformers for Histopathology: Pretraining and Normalization in Breast Cancer Classification,Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one of the subtypes of breast cancer characterized by a heterogeneous and aggressive nature. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has drawn significant attention in cancer treatment. However- solubility of photosensitizer- penetration problems into a target tissue and insufficient oxygen concentration limit the effectiveness of PDT. To overcome these limitations and to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy- combination treatment modalities play an essential role in cancer treatment. In this study- we aimed to investigate the combination efficacy of cisplatin-based chemotherapy and 5-Aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA)/PDT in TNBC cells and healthy breast cellsÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ in vitro. To determine the effect of the combination effects of cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT on TNBC cells- two treatment protocols (simultaneous and sequential combination therapy) were evaluated compared with cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT monotherapy and WST-1- Annexin V assay- acridine orange (AO) and mitochondrial staining were performed. Our findings showed that MDA-MB-231 TNBC cell viability was significantly decreased following simultaneous combination treatment compared to cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT monotherapy. Additionally- simultaneous combination treatment was more effective than sequential combination treatment. The simultaneous combination treatment of 2.5Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬ÂµM cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT at 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ J/cm2 and 9Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ J/cm2 induced 46.78% and 53.6% total apoptotic death- respectively in TNBC cells compared with monotherapies (cisplatin (37.88%) and 5-ALA/PDT (6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ J/cm2: 31.48% and 9Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ J/cm2: 37.78%). Additionally- cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT combination treatment resulted in nuclear fragmentation and mitochondrial damage due to apoptosis. Our results suggest that cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT simultaneous combination therapy could be a promising new alternative strategy for treating TNBC. However- further studies are required to assess the underlying molecular mechanisms of cisplatin and 5-ALA/PDT combination treatment at the molecular level.

Annisa Maulana Majid- Ismasari Nawangsih,Perbandingan Metode Ensemble Untuk Meningkatkan Akurasi Algoritm Machine Learning Dalam Memprediksi Penyakit Breast Cancer (Kanker Payudara),Background Mirai- a state-of-the-art deep learning-based algorithm for predicting short-term breast cancer risk- outperforms standard clinical risk models. However- Mirai is a black box- risking overreliance on the algorithm and incorrect diagnoses. Purpose To identify whether bilateral dissimilarity underpins Mirai's reasoning process; create a simplified- intelligible model- AsymMirai- using bilateral dissimilarity; and determine if AsymMirai may approximate Mirai's performance in 1-5-year breast cancer risk prediction. Materials and Methods This retrospective study involved mammograms obtained from patients in the EMory BrEast imaging Dataset- known as EMBED- from January 2013 to December 2020. To approximate 1-5-year breast cancer risk predictions from Mirai- another deep learning-based model- AsymMirai- was built with an interpretable module: local bilateral dissimilarity (localized differences between left and right breast tissue). Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between the risk scores of Mirai and those of AsymMirai. Subgroup analysis was performed in patients for whom AsymMirai's year-over-year reasoning was consistent. AsymMirai and Mirai risk scores were compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)- and 95% CIs were calculated using the DeLong method. Results Screening mammograms (n = 210â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢067) from 81â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢824 patients (mean age- 59.4 years Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 11.4 [SD]) were included in the study. Deep learning-extracted bilateral dissimilarity produced similar risk scores to those of Mirai (1-year risk prediction- r = 0.6832; 4-5-year prediction- r = 0.6988) and achieved similar performance as Mirai. For AsymMirai- the 1-year breast cancer risk AUC was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73- 0.85) (Mirai- 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79- 0.89; P = .002)- and the 5-year risk AUC was 0.66 (95% CI: 0.63- 0.69) (Mirai- 0.71; 95% CI: 0.68- 0.74; P < .001). In a subgroup of 183 patients for whom AsymMirai repeatedly highlighted the same tissue over time- AsymMirai achieved a 3-year AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.86- 0.97). Conclusion Localized bilateral dissimilarity- an imaging marker for breast cancer risk- approximated the predictive power of Mirai and was a key to Mirai's reasoning.

Oluwatosin Seyi Oyebanji- Akinkunmi Rasheed APAMPA- Olugesun Afolabi- Samson Ohikhuare Eromonsei- Akeem Babalola,Performance benchmarking of convolutional neural networks and ensemble machine learning techniques for automated mammographic breast cancer detection: A comparative study,Abstract: Invasion of neighboring tissues is a cardinal feature of malignancy- notably observed in aggressive cancers like breast cancer- where it can lead to significant morbidity. To explore cancer invasion dynamics- the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid invasion assay offers a swift approach to mimicking a tumor micro-region or micro-metastasis. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) time-lapse imaging was chosen for its fluorescence-free and non-destructive advantages in capturing live spheroid movement. However- the subsequent analysis posed challenges- including out-of-focus cells and a voluminous dataset with diverse microscope planes and time points. Our study introduces a segmentation framework featuring in-focus spatial stacking algorithm and novel training architecture that enabling in-depth automated analysis of 3D spheroid invasion behaviors within a microenvironment. Firstly- the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids were cultured in a microwell dish and then incorporated into a collagen type I matrix for the 3D spheroid invasion assay. Capturing spheroid invasion dynamics involved acquiring 15 z-plane images (spaced at 20 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Âµm intervals) per timepoint for each spheroid using DIC microscopy at 15-minute intervals over a 28-hour period- employing a 20X objective lens. We refined the Focus Stacking framework into Multiple Slices Blurry Stacking (MSB-Stack) by pre-filtering blurred areas before stacking images. This process produced 6390 slices consolidated into 426 labeled stacked images- highlighting Invasive area- Spheroid core- and Invasive cells post-invasion. We then enhanced Mask R-CNN (Region based-Convolutional Neural Networks) with a weak-to-strong augmentation mechanism- leveraging well-segmented samples from MSB-Stack for training on both fully stacked and blurred images. Blurry Consistency Mask R-CNN (BCMask R-CNN) demonstrates overall improvement across feature extractors- outperforming Mask R-CNN. Using Mean average precision (mAP) as the main metric for instance segmentation and detection- our proposed model achieves 73.0% and 65.2% on mAP @[0.5- 0.95]- showcasing robustness. Notably- our best results for mAP @0.5 reach 96.6% and 96.7% on both tasks- underscoring the effectiveness of consistency training in mitigating unclear boundary issues during preprocessing. In conclusion- our proposed method- MSB-Stack- effectively addresses the challenge of unclear boundaries in 3D breast cancer cell DIC microscopy datasets. The integration of weak-to-strong consistency training in our model- BCMask R-CNN- not only mitigates biases but also enhances performance across different backbones- setting the stage for future advancements in cell-tracking tasks and broader migratory analyses.

This study aimed to investigate the potential of ultrasound-based radiomics and clinical characteristics in non-invasively distinguishing between low tumor burden (1-2 positive nodes) and high tumor burden (more than 2 positive nodes) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. A total of 215 patients with node-positive breast cancer- who underwent preoperative ultrasound examinations- were enrolled in this study. Among these patients- 144 cases were allocated to the training set- 37 cases to the validation set- and 34 cases to the testing set. Postoperative histopathology was used to determine the status of ALN tumor burden. The region of interest for breast cancer was delineated on the ultrasound image. Nine models were developed to predict high ALN tumor burden- employing a combination of three feature screening methods and three machine learning classifiers. Ultimately- the optimal model was selected and tested on both the validation and testing sets. In addition- clinical characteristics were screened to develop a clinical model. Furthermore- Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were utilized to provide explanations for the machine learning model. During the validation and testing sets- the models demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.577 to 0.733 and 0.583 to 0.719- and accuracies ranging from 64.9% to 75.7% and 64.7% to 70.6%- respectively. Ultimately- the Boruta_XGB model- comprising five radiomics features- was selected as the final model. The AUC values of this model for distinguishing low from high tumor burden were 0.828- 0.715- and 0.719 in the training- validation- and testing sets- respectively- demonstrating its superiority over the clinical model. The developed radiomics models exhibited a significant level of predictive performance. The Boruta_XGB radiomics model outperformed other radiomics models in this study.

Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive asymptomatic patients who underwent mammography with DBT (2019-2020). Two AI systems (Transpara 1.7.0 and ProFound AI 3.0) were used to evaluate the DBT examinations. The systems were compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to calculate the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for detecting malignancy overall and within subgroups based on mammographic breast density. Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System results obtained from standard-of-care human double-reading were compared against AI results with use of the DeLong test. Results Of 419 female patients (median age- 60 years [IQR- 52-70 years]) included- 58 had histologically proven breast cancer. The AUC was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.85- 0.91)- 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90- 0.95)- and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96- 0.99) for Transpara- ProFound AI- and human double-reading- respectively. For Transpara- a rule-out criterion of score 7 or lower yielded 100% (95% CI: 94.2- 100.0) sensitivity and 60.9% (95% CI: 55.7- 66.0) specificity. The rule-in criterion of higher than score 9 yielded 96.6% sensitivity (95% CI: 88.1- 99.6) and 78.1% specificity (95% CI: 73.8- 82.5). For ProFound AI- a rule-out criterion of lower than score 51 yielded 100% sensitivity (95% CI: 93.8- 100) and 67.0% specificity (95% CI: 62.2- 72.1). The rule-in criterion of higher than score 69 yielded 93.1% (95% CI: 83.3- 98.1) sensitivity and 82.0% (95% CI: 77.9- 86.1) specificity. Conclusion Both AI systems showed high performance in breast cancer detection but lower performance compared with human double-reading.

This demonstrates the importance of early detection for the effectiveness of BC treatment. Among the new diagnostic strategies- the use of liquid biopsies is emerging as a promising alternative for early cancer detection and patient follow-up. miRNAs are small non-coding RNA molecules useful as biomarkers- since they can be found in body fluids. Oncoliqâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s approach focuses on the relative quantification of a panel of circulating miRNA biomarkers for the early detection of BC using predictive models built with machine learning techniques. Methods: The aim of this work was to identify a highly sensitive miRNA combination based on liquid biopsies together with predictive models- to generate an assay for BC early detection which we named Oncoliq breast. Human plasma samples (n=239) from BC patients and healthy donors (HD) were divided into two cohorts: exploratory (n=66) and validation (n=173). The exploratory cohort was used for the identification of miRNAs using expression microarrays and miRNA-seq. The validation cohort was used for the analytical validation of potential candidates by RT-qPCR. Results: Using ROC curve analysis- 11 miRNAs were identified as potential biomarkers. By RT-qPCR- we validated the expression of the 11 miRNAs. All of them were significantly increased in BC patient samples (n=100) compared to HD (n=73)- in accordance with expression microarrays and miRNA-seq results. Using machine learning we established 7 predictive models that combine these miRNAs. After running all the predictive models using logistic regression- the metrics associated with each one were calculated. From these- model 7 showed a sensitivity of 90%- a specificity of 73% and an accuracy of 83%. Conclusions: MiRNAs show satisfactory advantages as biomarkers as they can circulate in body fluids- such as blood and urine. In the presence of diseases such as BC- the level of some specific miRNAs might be altered and this change can be harnessed for detection- diagnosis and prognosis. Here- we generated a panel of 11 miRNAs that showed increased expression in plasma samples from women diagnosed with BC. Oncoliq breast is a promising low cost and highly sensitive novel liquid biopsy test based on circulating miRNAs for BC screening.

Patil- Anil Kumar Pujari- Umesh Singh- Vikas Rishi- Jayeeta Bhaumik,Photoarchitectonic Hydrogels for Synergistic In Vitro Chemo-Phototherapy of Breast Cancer,Breast cancer is becoming a significant global health challenge- with millions of fatalities annually. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can provide various sequences for characterizing tumor morphology and internal patterns- and becomes an effective tool for detection and diagnosis of breast tumors. However- previous deep-learning based tumor segmentation methods from multi-parametric MRI still have limitations in exploring inter-modality information and focusing task-informative modality/modalities. To address these shortcomings- we propose a Modality-Specific Information Disentanglement (MoSID) framework to extract both inter- and intra-modality attention maps as prior knowledge for guiding tumor segmentation. Specifically- by disentangling modality-specific information- the MoSID framework provides complementary clues for the segmentation task- by generating modality-specific attention maps to guide modality selection and inter-modality evaluation. Our experiments on two 3D breast datasets and one 2D prostate dataset demonstrate that the MoSID framework outperforms other state-of-the-art multi-modality segmentation methods- even in the cases of missing modalities. Based on the segmented lesions- we further train a classifier to predict the patientsâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢ response to radiotherapy. The prediction accuracy is comparable to the case of using manually-segmented tumors for treatment outcome prediction- indicating the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed segmentation method.

De Siervi,Plasma microRNA signature as a potential early detection biomarker in breast cancer.,Staining of histological slides with Hematoxylin and Eosin is widely used in clinical and laboratory settings as these dyes reveal nuclear structures as well as cytoplasm and collagen. For cancer diagnosis- these slides are used to recognize tissues and morphological changes. Tissue semantic segmentation is therefore important and at the same time a challenging and time-consuming task. This paper describes a UNet-like deep learning architecture called DRD-UNet- which adds a novel processing block called DRD (Dilation- Residual- and Dense block) to a UNet architecture. DRD is formed by the combination of dilated convolutions (D)- residual connections (R)- and dense layers (D). DRD-UNet was applied to the multi-class (tumor- stroma- inflammatory- necrosis- and other) semantic segmentation of histological images from breast cancer samples stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin. The histological images were released through the Breast Cancer Semantic Segmentation (BCSS) Challenge. DRD-UNet outperformed the original UNet architecture and 15 other UNet-based architectures on the segmentation of 12-930 image patches extracted from regions of interest that ranged in size between $1036 \times 1222$ to $6813 \times 7360$ pixels. DRD-UNet obtained the best performance as measured with Jaccard similarity index- Dice coefficient- in a per-class comparison and accuracy for overall segmentation.

Chemoresistant breast cancer stem cells (BCSCs) play a pivotal role in cancer recurrence and metastasis- however- identification and eradication of BCSC population in patients are challenging. Here- an mRNA-based BCSC signature is developed using machine learning strategy to evaluate cancer stemness in primary breast cancer patient samples. Using the BCSC signature- a critical role of polyamine anabolism in the regulation of chemotherapy-induced BCSC enrichment- is elucidated. Mechanistically- two key polyamine anabolic enzymes- ODC1 and SRM- are directly activated by transcription factor HIF-1 in response to chemotherapy. Genetic inhibition of HIF-1-controlled polyamine anabolism blocks chemotherapy-induced BCSC enrichment in vitro and in xenograft mice. A novel specific HIF-1 inhibitor britannin is identified through a natural compound library screening- and demonstrate that coadministration of britannin efficiently inhibits chemotherapy-induced HIF-1 transcriptional activity- ODC1 and SRM expression- polyamine levels- and BCSC enrichment in vitro and in xenograft and autochthonous mouse models. The findings demonstrate the key role of polyamine anabolism in BCSC regulation and provide a new strategy for breast cancer treatment.

The key enzymes involved in this tryptophan metabolism such as indoleamine 2-3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2-3-dioxygenase (TDO) are reported as promising novel targets in cancer immunotherapy. IDO1 and TDO overexpression in TNBC cells promote resistance to cell death- proliferation- invasion- and metastasis. To date- there are no clinically available small-molecule inhibitors that target these enzymes. Navoximod- a reliable dual-specific inhibitor- resulted in poor bioavailability and modest efficacy in clinical trials restricts its utility. This situation urges the development of a potent drug-like candidate against these key enzymes. A total of 1574 natural compounds were proclaimed and subjected to ADME screening. Subsequently- the resultant compounds were attributed to hierarchical molecular docking and MM-GBSA validation. Ultimately- re-scoring with the aid of combined machine learning algorithms resulted six lead compounds. Captivatingly- NPACT00380 exhibited maximum interaction among the lead compounds. In addition- the scaffold analysis also highlighted that the chromanone moiety of the hit compound boasts anti-cancer activity against breast cancer cell lines. The reliability of the results was corroborated through a rigorous 100â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢ns molecular dynamics simulation using the parameters including RMSD- PCA and FEL analysis. In light of these findings- it is presumed that the proposed compound exhibits significant inhibitory activity. As a result- we speculate that further optimisation of NPACT00380 could be beneficial for the treatment and management of TNBC.

Regrettably- treatment options for TNBC remain limited due to its clinical complexity. However- immunotherapy has emerged as a promising avenue- showing success in developing effective therapies for advanced cases and improving patient outcomes. Improving TNBC treatments involves reducing side effects- minimizing systemic toxicity- and enhancing efficacy. Unlike traditional cancer immunotherapy- engineered nonmaterial's can precisely target TNBC- facilitating immune cell access- improving antigen presentation- and triggering lasting immune responses. Nanocarriers with enhanced sensitivity and specificity- specific cellular absorption- and low toxicity are gaining attention. Nanotechnology-driven immunoengineering strategies focus on targeted delivery systems using multifunctional molecules for precise tracking- diagnosis- and therapy in TNBC. This study delves into TNBC's tumour microenvironment (TME) remodeling- therapeutic resistance- and immunoengineering strategies using nanotechnology.

This combination aims to address several challenges inherent in traditional screening while promising an improvement in healthcare delivery across multiple dimensions. For patients- this technological synergy has the potential to lower the number of unnecessary recalls and associated procedures such as biopsies- thereby reducing patient anxiety and improving overall experience without compromising diagnostic accuracy. For radiologists- the use of combined AI and DBT could significantly decrease workload and reduce fatigue by effectively highlighting breast imaging abnormalities- which is especially beneficial in high-volume clinical settings. Health systems stand to gain from streamlined workflows and the facilitated deployment of DBT- which is particularly valuable in areas with a scarcity of specialized breast radiologists. However- despite these potential benefits- substantial challenges remain. Bridging the gap between the development of complex AI algorithms and implementation into clinical practice requires ongoing research and development. This is essential to optimize the reliability of these systems and ensure they are accessible to healthcare providers and patients- who are the ultimate beneficiaries of this technological advancement. This article reviews the benefits of combined AI-DBT imaging- particularly the ability of AI to enhance the benefits of DBT and reduce its existing limitations.
Zhi-Hui Chen- Hai-Ling Zha- Qing Yao- Wen-Bo Zhang- Guang-Quan Zhou- Cui-Ying Li,Predicting Pathological Characteristics of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer from Ultrasound Images: a Deep Ensemble Approach,BACKGROUND. MRI radiomics has been explored for three-tiered classification of HER2 expression levels (i.e.- HER2-zero- HER2-low- or HER2-positive) in patients with breast cancer- although an understanding of how such models reach their predictions is lacking. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to develop and test multiparametric MRI radiomics machine learning models for differentiating three-tiered HER2 expression levels in patients with breast cancer- as well as to explain the contributions of model features through local and global interpretations with the use of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis. METHODS. This retrospective study included 737 patients (mean age- 54.1 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 10.6 [SD] years) with breast cancer from two centers (center 1 [n = 578] and center 2 [n = 159])- all of whom underwent multiparametric breast MRI and had HER2 expression determined after excisional biopsy. Analysis entailed two tasks: differentiating HER2-negative (i.e.- HER2-zero or HER2-low) tumors from HER2-positive tumors (task 1) and differentiating HER2-zero tumors from HER2-low tumors (task 2). For each task- patients from center 1 were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to a training set (task 1: n = 405; task 2: n = 284) or an internal test set (task 1: n = 173; task 2: n = 122); patients from center 2 formed an external test set (task 1: n = 159; task 2: n = 105). Radiomic features were extracted from early phase dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging- T2-weighted imaging- and DWI. For each task- a support vector machine (SVM) was used for feature selection- a multiparametric radiomics score (radscore) was computed using feature weights from SVM correlation coefficients- conventional MRI and combined models were constructed- and model performances were evaluated. SHAP analysis was used to provide local and global interpretations of the model outputs. RESULTS. In the external test set- for task 1- AUCs for the conventional MRI model- radscore- and the combined model were 0.624- 0.757- and 0.762- respectively; for task 2- the AUC for radscore was 0.754- and no conventional MRI model or combined model could be constructed. SHAP analysis identified early phase DCE imaging features as having the strongest influence for both tasks; T2-weighted imaging features also had a prominent role for task 2. CONCLUSION. The findings indicate suboptimal performance of MRI radiomics models for noninvasive characterization of HER2 expression. CLINICAL IMPACT. The study provides an example of the use of SHAP interpretation analysis to better understand predictions of imaging-based machine learning models.
Sathishkumar J- Dr. Venkatasalam K,Prediction and Classifications of Breast Cancer using Enhanced Convolutional Neural Network Approaches,Breast cancer is a deadly disease commonly affecting women. One method to avoid death from breast cancer is to obtain a diagnosis early. Breast cancer detection is a significant area that benefits from the technological advancements in artificial intelligence. A deep neural network architecture for the classification of microscopic images of breast tumor tissue acquired using excisional biopsy has been proposed. A hybrid convolutional neural network model with asymmetric convolutions and Levenbergâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®Marquardt optimization named as LMHistNet is used for the classification of breast cancer images into binary as well as eight subclasses. Convolution block attention module is incorporated for adaptive feature refining. Convergence time has been significantly reduced by normalizing the input features on models using batch normalization. Training is improved by reducing the internal covariance shift. Hinge loss function is used for better convergence. Magnification-dependent as well as independent binary and eight class classifications are efficiently performed by extracting diversified features from histopathological images. 7909 histopathological images of which 2480 were images of benign (normal) and the remaining images of malignant patients were used for the study. Further- performance evaluation on the dataset using LMHistNet has been analyzed based on the loss and accuracy curve. The experimental findings show that the proposed model obtained good performance over the various magnifications 40X- 100X- 200X and 400X. The accuracy- precision- recall and F1 score obtained are 88- 89- 88 and 88 respectively for multiclass classification into eight subtypes. The accuracy- precision- recall and f1 score are 99 each for binary classification of breast tumor tissues into benign and malignant classes.

Currently- diagnosing breast cancer and evaluating the efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy (NAIT) primarily rely on pathological identification of tumor cell morphology- count- and arrangement. However- when tumors are small- the tumors and tumor beds are difficult to detect; relying solely on tumor cell identification may lead to false negatives. In this study- we used the label-free multiphoton microscopy (MPM) method to quantitatively analyze breast tissue at the cellular- extracellular- and textural levels- and identified 11 key factors that can effectively distinguish different types of breast diseases. Key factors and clinical data are used to train a two-stage machine learning automatic diagnosis model- MINT- to accurately diagnose breast cancer. The classification capability of MINT was validated in independent cohorts (stage 1 AUC = 0.92; stage 2 AUC = 1.00). Furthermore- we also found that some factors could predict and assess the efficacy of NAIT- demonstrating the potential of label-free MPM in breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. We envision that in the future- label-free MPM can be used to complement stromal and textural information in pathological tissue- benefiting breast cancer diagnosis and neoadjuvant therapy efficacy prediction- thereby assisting clinicians in formulating personalized treatment plans.
Ha Ye Jin Kang- Minsam Ko- Kwang Sun Ryu,Prediction model for survival of younger patients with breast cancer using the breast cancer public staging database,In this study- we aimed to investigate the clinical feasibility of deep learning (DL)-based reconstruction applied to conventional diffusion-weighted imaging (cDWI) and synthetic diffusion-weighted imaging (sDWI) by comparing the DL reconstructions to cDWIs and sDWIs in patients with various breast malignancies. We retrospectively analyzed 115 patients with biopsy-proven breast malignancies who underwent breast magnetic resonance imaging from July 2022 to June 2023- including cDWI with b-value of 800Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ s/mm2 (cDWI800)- sDWI with b-value of 1500Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ s/mm2 (sDWI1500)- DWI using DL-based reconstruction (DL-DWI) with b-value of 800Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ s/mm2- and synthetic DL-DWI with b-value of 1500Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ s/mm2 (DL-DWI800 and sDL-DWI1500). Two radiologists independently performed the qualitative analyses using a 5-point Likert scale for all DWI sets. The quantitative analyses were also conducted for signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)- contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR)- and cancer-to-parenchyma contrast ratio (CPR). DL-DWI800 and sDL-DWI1500 provided better lesion conspicuity and thoracic muscle and rib delineation than cDWI800 and sDWI1500 (all P < 0.05). DL-DWI800 and sDL-DWI1500 showed comparable normal parenchymal signals to those of cDWI800 and sDWI1500 (all P > 0.05). sDL-DWI1500 and sDWI1500 showed no significant differences in SNR and CNR (P = 0.908- and PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.081- respectively). DL-DWI800 and cDWI800 were not significantly different between SNR- CNR- and CPR (all P > 0.05). DL-DWI outperformed cDWI and sDWI in both qualitative and quantitative analyses at the high b-values- while also achieving a shorter acquisition time.
Andreas Ekholm- Yinxi Wang- Johan Vallon-Christersson- Constance Boissin- Mattias Rantalainen,Prediction of gene expression-based breast cancer proliferation scores from histopathology whole slide images using deep learning,Breast cancer is a leading cause of death among women- and early detection is crucial for improving survival rates. The manual breast cancer diagnosis utilizes more time and is subjective. Also- the previous CAD models mostly depend on manmade visual details that are complex to generalize across ultrasound images utilizing distinct techniques. Distinct imaging tools have been utilized in previous works such as mammography and MRI. However- these imaging tools are costly and less portable than ultrasound imaging. Also- ultrasound imaging is a non-invasive method commonly used for breast cancer screening. Hence- the paper presents a novel deep learning model- BCDNet- for classifying breast tumors as benign or malignant using ultrasound images. The primary aim of the study is to design an effective breast cancer diagnosis model that can accurately classify tumors in their early stages- thus reducing mortality rates. The model aims to optimize the weight and parameters using the RPAOSM-ESO algorithm to enhance accuracy and minimize false negative rates. The BCDNet model utilizes transfer learning from a pre-trained VGG16 network for feature extraction and employs an AHDNAM classification approach- which includes ASPP- DTCN- 1DCNN- and an attention mechanism. The RPAOSM-ESO algorithm is used to fine-tune the weights and parameters. The RPAOSM-ESO-BCDNet-based breast cancer diagnosis model provided 94.5 accuracy rates. This value is relatively higher than the previous models such as DTCN (88.2)- 1DCNN (89.6)- MobileNet (91.3)- and ASPP-DTC-1DCNN-AM (93.8). Hence- it is guaranteed that the designed RPAOSM-ESO-BCDNet produces relatively accurate solutions for the classification than the previous models. The BCDNet model- with its sophisticated feature extraction and classification techniques optimized by the RPAOSM-ESO algorithm- shows promise in accurately classifying breast tumors using ultrasound images. The study suggests that the model could be a valuable tool in the early detection of breast cancer- potentially saving lives and reducing the burden on healthcare systems.
Chunling Zhang- Peng Zhou- Ruobing Li- Zhongyuan Li- Aimei Ouyang,Prediction of lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer based on clinical-MRI radiomics features,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information- but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning- which typically analyze small- isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients- we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs- constructs a spatial TME graph- and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models- including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy- 96.0% sensitivity- 88.0% specificity- and an AUC of 0.82- through eight-fold cross-validation- outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response- thereby helping to prevent overtreatment- improve patient quality of life- reduce treatment cost- and enhance clinical outcomes- marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.
Bowen Jing- Kai Wang- Erich Schmitz- Shanshan Tang- Yunxiang Li- You Zhang- Jing Wang,Prediction of pathological complete response to chemotherapy for breast cancer using deep neural network with uncertainty quantification,Surgery remains the primary treatment modality in the management of early-stage invasive breast cancer. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered visualization platforms offer the compelling potential to aid surgeons in evaluating the tumor's location and morphology within the breast and accordingly optimize their surgical approach. We sought to validate an AI platform that employs dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) to render three-dimensional (3D) representations of the tumor and 5 additional chest tissues- offering clear visualizations as well as functionalities for quantifying tumor morphology- tumor-to-landmark structure distances- excision volumes- and approximate surgical margins. This retrospective study assessed the visualization platform's performance on 100 cases with ground-truth labels vetted by 2 breast-specialized radiologists. We assessed features including automatic AI-generated clinical metrics (e.g.- tumor dimensions) as well as visualization tools including convex hulls at desired margins around the tumor to help visualize lumpectomy volume. The statistical performance of the platform's automated features was robust and within the range of inter-radiologist variability. These detailed 3D tumor and surrounding multi-tissue depictions offer both qualitative and quantitative comprehension of cancer topology and may aid in formulating an optimal surgical approach for breast cancer treatment. We further establish the framework for broader data integration into the platform to enhance precision cancer care.
Guobang Yu- Yi Zuo- Bin Wang- Hui Liu,Prediction of Tumor-Associated Macrophages and Immunotherapy Benefits Using Weakly Supervised Contrastive Learning in Breast Cancer Pathology Images,In this study- exhaled breath testing has been considered a promising method for the detection and monitoring of breast cancer (BC). A high-pressure photon ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPPI-TOFMS) platform was used to detect volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath samples. Then- machine learning (ML) models were constructed on VOCs for the diagnosis of BC and its progression monitoring. Ultimately- 1981 women with useable breath samples were included in the study- of whom 937 (47.3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %) had been diagnosed with BC. VOC panels were used for ML model construction for BC detection and progression monitoring. On the blinded testing cohort- this VOC-based model successfully differentiated patients with and without BC with sensitivity- specificity- and area under receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) values of 85.9Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- 90.4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ %- and 0.946. The corresponding AUC values when differentiating between patients with and without lymph node metastasis (LNM) or between patients with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage 0/I/II or III/IV disease were 0.840 and 0.708- respectively. While developed VOC-based models exhibited poor performance when attempting to differentiate between patients based on pathological patterns (Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) vs Invasive BC (IBC)) or molecular subtypes (Luminal vs Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2+) vs Triple-negative BC (TNBC)) of BC. Collectively- the HPPI-TOFMS-based breathomics approaches may offer value for the detection and progression monitoring of BC. Additional research is necessary to explore the fundamental mechanisms of the identified VOCs.

Peng Huang- Hui Yan- Jiawen Shang- Xin Xie,Prior information guided deep-learning model for tumor bed segmentation in breast cancer radiotherapy,Cardiotoxicity is one of the major concerns in breast cancer treatment- significantly affecting patient outcomes. To improve the likelihood of favorable outcomes for breast cancer survivors- it is essential to carefully balance the potential advantages of treatment methods with the risks of harm to healthy tissues- including the heart. There is currently a lack of comprehensive- data-driven evidence on effective risk stratification strategies. The aim of this study is to investigate the prediction of cardiotoxicity using machine learning methods combined with radiomics- clinical- and dosimetric features. A cohort of 83 left-sided breast cancer patients without a history of cardiac disease was examined. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and after 6 months of treatment to evaluate cardiotoxicity. Cardiac dose-volume histograms- demographic data- echocardiographic parameters- and ultrasound imaging radiomics features were collected for all patients. Toxicity modeling was developed with three feature selection methods and five classifiers in four separate groups (Dosimetric- DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Demographic- DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ DemographicÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Clinical- and DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ DemographicÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ ClinicalÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Imaging). The prediction performance of the models was validated using five-fold cross-validation and evaluated by AUCs. 58% of patients showed cardiotoxicity 6 months after treatment. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction and Global longitudinal strain decreased significantly compared to pre-treatment (p-valueÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ <Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.001).

Despite the existence of intelligent deep learning models- their efficacy is often limited due to the oversight of small-sized masses- leading to false positive and false negative outcomes. This research introduces a novel segmentation-guided classification model developed to increase BC detection accuracy. The designed model unfolds in two critical phases- each contributing to a comprehensive BC diagnostic pipeline. In Phase I- the Attention U-Net model is utilized for BC segmentation. The encoder extracts hierarchical features- while the decoder- supported by attention mechanisms- refines the segmentation- focusing on suspicious regions. In Phase II- a novel ensemble approach is introduced for BC classification- involving various feature extraction methods- base classifiers- and a meta-classifier. An ensemble of model classifiers-including support vector machine- decision trees- k-nearest neighbor and artificial neural network- captures diverse patterns within these features. The Random Forest meta-classifier amalgamates their outputs- leveraging their collective strengths. The proposed integrated model accurately identifies different breast tumor classes- including malignant- benign- and normal. The precise region-of-interest analysis from segmentation phase significantly boosted classification performance of ensemble meta-classifier. The model accomplished an overall accuracy rate of 99.57% with high segmentation performance of 95% f1-score- illustrating its high discriminative power in detecting malignant- benign- and normal cases within the ultrasound image dataset. This research contributes to reducing breast tumor morbidity and mortality by facilitating early detection and timely intervention- ultimately supporting better patient outcomes.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Clinical data- mammography- and MRI images (including T2WI- diffusion-weighted images (DWI)- apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC)- and DCE-MRI images) of 132 benign and breast cancer patients were analyzed retrospectively. The region of interest (ROI) in each image was marked and segmented using MATLAB software. The mammography- T2WI- DWI- ADC- and DCE-MRI models based on the ResNet34 network were trained. Using an integrated learning method- the five models were used as a basic model- and voting methods were used to construct a multimodal model. The dataset was divided into a training set and a prediction set. The accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- positive predictive value- and negative predictive value of the model were calculated. The diagnostic efficacy of each model was analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and an area under the curve (AUC). The diagnostic value was determined by the DeLong test with statistically significant differences set at P < 0.05. RESULTS We evaluated the ability of the model to classify benign and malignant tumors using the test set. The AUC values of the multimodal model- mammography model- T2WI model- DWI model- ADC model and DCE-MRI model were 0.943- 0.645- 0.595- 0.905- 0.900- and 0.865- respectively. The diagnostic ability of the multimodal model was significantly higher compared with that of the mammography and T2WI models. However- compared with the DWI- ADC- and DCE-MRI models- there was no significant difference in the diagnostic ability of these models. CONCLUSION Our deep learning model based on multimodal image training has practical value for the diagnosis of benign and malignant breast lesions.
Xiaoyan Wu- Wenchuan Zhang- Xunxi Lu- Xiaorong Zhong- Hong Bu,Prognostic significance of ER-to-PR difference in ER+/HER2- early breast cancer,Background/Objectives: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide- requiring strategic efforts to reduce its mortality. This study aimed to develop a predictive classification model for breast cancer mortality using real-world data- including various clinical features. Methods: A total of 11-286 patients with breast cancer from the National Cancer Center were included in this study. The mortality rate of the total sample was approximately 6.2%. Propensity score matching was used to reduce bias. Several machine learning models- including extreme gradient boosting- were applied to 31 clinical features. To enhance model interpretability- we used the SHapley Additive exPlanations method. ML analyses were also performed on the samples- excluding patients who developed other cancers after breast cancer. Results: Among the ML models- the XGB model exhibited the highest discriminatory power- with an area under the curve of 0.8722 and a specificity of 0.9472. Key predictors of the mortality classification model included occurrence in other organs- age at diagnosis- N stage- T stage- curative radiation treatment- and Ki-67(%). Even after excluding patients who developed other cancers after breast cancer- the XGB model remained the best-performing- with an AUC of 0.8518 and a specificity of 0.9766. Additionally- the top predictors from SHAP were similar to the results for the overall sample. Conclusions: Our models provided excellent predictions of breast cancer mortality using real-world data from South Korea. Explainable artificial intelligence- such as SHAP- validated the clinical applicability and interpretability of these models.
Ruoqing Chen- Hairong Zhang- Xue Zhao- Lin Zhu- XiaoYu Zhang- Yuning Ma- Lei Xia,Progress on the mechanism of action of emodin against breast cancer cells,To develop a multi-parametric MRI model for the prediction of molecular subtypes of breast cancer using five types of breast cancer preoperative MRI images. In this study- we retrospectively analyzed clinical data and five types of MRI images (FS-T1WI- T2WI- Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1-C)- DWI- and ADC) from 325 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer. Using the five types of MRI images as inputs to the ResNeXt50 model respectively- five base models were constructed- and then the outputs of the five base models were fused using an ensemble learning approach to develop a multi-parametric MRI model. Breast cancer was classified into four molecular subtypes based on immunohistochemical results: luminal A- luminal B- human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive (HER2-positive)- and triple-negative (TN). The whole dataset was randomly divided into a training set (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 260; 76 luminal A- 80 luminal B- 50 HER2-positive- 54 TN) and a testing set (nÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 65; 20 luminal A- 20 luminal B- 12 HER2-positive- 13 TN). Accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the predictive performance of the models. In the testing set- for the assessment of the four molecular subtypes of breast cancer- the multi-parametric MRI model yielded an AUC of 0.859-0.912; the AUCs based on the FS-T1WI- T2WI- T1-C- DWI- and ADC models achieved respectively 0.632-0. 814- 0.641-0.788- 0.621-0.709- 0.620-0.701and 0.611-0.785. The multi-parametric MRI model we developed outperformed the base models in predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes. Our study also showed the potential of FS-T1WI base model in predicting breast cancer molecular subtypes.
Jing Wang- Baizhou Li- Meng Luo- Jia Huang- Kun Zhang- Shu Zheng- Suzhan Zhang- Jiaojiao Zhou,Progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer: molecular features and clinical significance,This study aims to assess the diagnostic value of ultrasound habitat sub-region radiomics feature parameters using a fully connected neural networks (FCNN) combination method L2-1-norm in relation to breast cancer Ki-67 status. Ultrasound images from 528 cases of female breast cancer at the Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University and 232 cases of female breast cancer at the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of Xiangnan University were selected for this study. We utilized deep learning methods to automatically outline the gross tumor volume and perform habitat clustering. Subsequently- habitat sub-regions were extracted to identify radiomics features and underwent feature engineering using the L1-2-norm. A prediction model for the Ki-67 status of breast cancer patients was then developed using a FCNN. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy- area under the curve (AUC)- specificity (Spe)- positive predictive value (PPV)- negative predictive value (NPV)- Recall- and F1. In addition- calibration curves and clinical decision curves were plotted for the test set to visually assess the predictive accuracy and clinical benefit of the models. Based on the feature engineering using the L1-2-norm- a total of 9 core features were identified. The predictive model- constructed by the FCNN model based on these 9 features- achieved the following scores: ACC 0.856- AUC 0.915- Spe 0.843- PPV 0.920- NPV 0.747- Recall 0.974- and F1 0.890. Furthermore- calibration curves and clinical decision curves of the validation set demonstrated a high level of confidence in the model's performance and its clinical benefit. Habitat clustering of ultrasound images of breast cancer is effectively supported by the combined implementation of the L1-2-norm and FCNN algorithms- allowing for the accurate classification of the Ki-67 status in breast cancer patients.

The Jigsaw puzzle task in SSL enables models to learn both features of images and the positional relationships within images. In breast cancer diagnosis- radiologists evaluate not only lesion-specific features but also the surrounding breast structures. However- deep learning models that adopt a diagnostic approach similar to human radiologists are still limited. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the Jigsaw puzzle task in characterizing breast tissue structures for breast cancer classification on mammographic images. Using the Chinese Mammography Database (CMMD)- we compared four pre-training pipelines: (1) IN-Jig- pre-trained with both the ImageNet classification task and the Jigsaw puzzle task- (2) Scratch-Jig- pre-trained only with the Jigsaw puzzle task- (3) IN- pre-trained only with the ImageNet classification task- and (4) Scratch- that is trained from random initialization without any pre-training tasks. All pipelines were fine-tuned using binary classification to distinguish between the presence or absence of breast cancer. Performance was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)- sensitivity- and specificity. Additionally- detailed analysis was conducted for performance across different radiological findings- breast density- and regions of interest were visualized using gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM). The AUC for the four models were 0.925- 0.921- 0.918- 0.909- respectively. Our results suggest the Jigsaw puzzle task is an effective pre-training method for breast cancer classification- with the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy with limited data.
Takahiro Ochiya- Kazuki Hashimoto- Akihiko Shimomura,Prospects for liquid biopsy using microRNA and extracellular vesicles in breast cancer,Breast cancer is the second deadliest cancer (after lung cancer) globally among women- with high incidence and mortality rates. Its early diagnosis is pivotal for improving the cure rate. With the continuous development and maturity of deep learning technologies- traditional classification models have been widely applied for automated classification of pathological images. However- several challenges still persist. For instance- traditional classification models typically perform well in processing images with clear distinctions between target objects and backgrounds- but struggle to accurately classify pathological images due to the lack of clear distinctions between tumor lesion areas and background areas. In the light of this- we propose a two-stage breast tumor pathological classification model based on weakly supervised target localization- named ST-Double-Net. In the proposed model- precise lesion localization and classification are achieved in two stages. In the first stage- a set of global feature maps is obtained by utilizing the Swin Transformer. These feature maps are then input into a newly designed heatmap cropping (HMC) module- which forces the model to focus on discriminative features of lesion areas through heatmap-guided cropping- without requiring bounding boxes or relevant annotation information. This gradual refinement of target localization facilitates the extraction of useful global features- from coarse to fine. The images with discriminative features generated in the first stage serve as inputs for the second stage- where another Swin Transformer extracts local features from the magnified lesion region images. Finally- the global and local features extracted in the first and second stage- respectively- are fused to emphasize subtle differences in the images- thereby enhancing the modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s classification ability. The proposed ST-Double-Net model is evaluated on the BreaKHis and BACH public datasets- demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models.
Lin Tao- Qiu Wang- Xiaohong Zeng- Lan Fu- Junying Li- Hong Chen,Psychological distress in adult women of reproductive age at different stages after breast cancer diagnosis: A qualitative study.,Accurately estimating the breast muscle weight of broilers is important for poultry production. However- existing related methods are plagued by cumbersome processes and limited automation. To address these issues- this study proposed an efficient method for predicting the breast muscle weight of broilers. First- because existing deep learning models struggle to strike a balance between accuracy and memory consumption- this study designed a multistage attention enhancement fusion segmentation network (MAEFNet) to automatically acquire pectoral muscle mask images from X-ray images. MAEFNet employs the pruned MobileNetV3 as the encoder to efficiently capture features and adopts a novel decoder to enhance and fuse the effective features at various stages. Next- the selected shape features were automatically extracted from the mask images. Finally- these features- including live weight- were input to the SVR (Support Vector Regression) model to predict breast muscle weight. MAEFNet achieved the highest intersection over union (96.35%) with the lowest parameter count (1.51 M) compared to the other segmentation models. The SVR model performed best (R2 = 0.8810) compared to the other prediction models in the five-fold cross-validation. The research findings can be applied to broiler production and breeding- reducing measurement costs- and enhancing breeding efficiency.
Zulfikar Ali Ansari- Manish Madhava Tripathi- Rafeeq Ahmed,Quantifying Breast Cancer: Radiomics- Machine Learning- and Dimensionality Reduction for Enhanced Image-Based Diagnosis,The association between genetics and lifestyle factors is crucial when determining breast cancer susceptibility- a leading cause of deaths globally. This research aimed to compare the body mass index- smoking behavior- hormonal influences- and BRCA gene mutations between affected patients and healthy individuals- all with a family history of cancer. All these factors were then utilized as features to train a machine learning (ML) model to predict the risk of breast cancer development. Between 2020 and 2023- a total of 1389 women provided detailed lifestyle and risk factor data during visits to a familial cancer center in Italy. Descriptive and inferential statistics were assessed to explore the differences between the groups. Among the various classifiers used- the ensemble of decision trees was the best performer- with a 10-fold cross-validation scheme for training after normalizing the features. The performance of the model was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its area under the curve (AUC)- alongside the accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- precision- and F1 score. Analysis revealed that individuals in the tumor group exhibited a higher risk profile when compared to their healthy counterparts- particularly in terms of the lifestyle and genetic markers. The ML model demonstrated predictive power- with an AUC of 81%- 88% sensitivity- 57% specificity- 78% accuracy- 80% precision- and an F1 score of 0.84. These metrics significantly outperformed traditional statistical prediction models- including the BOADICEA and BCRAT- which showed an AUC below 0.65. This study demonstrated the efficacy of an ML approach in identifying women at higher risk of breast cancer- leveraging lifestyle and genetic factors- with an improved predictive performance over traditional methods.

Intrinsic heterogeneity especially characterizes breast tumors with a triple negative phenotype- often leading to the failure of even the most advanced therapeutic strategies. To improve breast cancer treatment- the use of natural agents to integrate conventional therapies is the subject of ever-increasing attention. In this context- garlic (Allium sativum) shows anti-cancerous potential- interfering with the proliferation- motility- and malignant progression of both non-invasive and invasive breast tumor cells. As heterogeneity could be at the basis of variable effects- the main objective of our study was to evaluate the anti-tumoral activity of a garlic extract in breast cancer cells with a triple negative phenotype. Established triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) were used- revealing subtype-dependent effects on morphology- cell cycle- and invasive potential- correlated with the peculiar down-modulation of Akt signaling- a crucial regulator in solid tumors. Our results first demonstrate that the effects of garlic on TNBC breast cancer are not unique and suggest that only more precise knowledge of the mechanisms activated by this natural compound in each tumor will allow for the inclusion of garlic in personalized therapeutic approaches to breast cancer.
Yi Yang- Dan Zhao- Ji Luo- Ling Lin- Yuxiang Lin- Baozhen Shan- Hongxu Chen- Liang Qiao,Quantitative Site-Specific Glycoproteomics Reveals Glyco-Signatures for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,Young breast cancer (YBC) patients often face a poor prognosis- hence it's necessary to construct a model that can accurately predict their long-term survival in early stage. To realize this goal- we utilized data from the Surveillance- Epidemiology- and End Results (SEER) databases between January 2010 and December 2020- and meanwhile- enrolled an independent external cohort from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. The study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model constructed using the Random Survival Forest (RSF) machine learning algorithm. By applying the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis- we pinpointed key prognostic factors for YBC patients- which were used to create a prediction model capable of forecasting the 3-year- 5-year- 7-year- and 10-year survival rates of YBC patients. The RSF model constructed in the study demonstrated exceptional performance- achieving C-index values of 0.920 in the training set- 0.789 in the internal validation set- and 0.701 in the external validation set- outperforming the Cox regression model. The model's calibration was confirmed by Brier scores at various time points- showcasing its excellent accuracy in prediction. Decision curve analysis (DCA) underscored the model's importance in clinical application- and the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) plots highlighted the importance of key variables. The RSF model also proved valuable in risk stratification- which has effectively categorized patients based on their survival risks. In summary- this study has constructed a well-performed prediction model for the evaluation of prognostic factors influencing the long-term survival of early-stage YBC patients- which is significant in risk stratification when physicians handle YBC patients in clinical settings.
Bin Hu- Yanjun Xu- Huiling Gong- Lang Tang- Hongchang Li,Radiomics Analysis of Intratumoral and Various Peritumoral Regions From Automated Breast Volume Scanning for Accurate Ki-67 Prediction in Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning,Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with various biological and clinical subtypes. HER2 status (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a crucial biomarker- associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Advanced algorithmic models can aid in predicting cancer growth and metastasis- serving as valuable clinical tools for classification and treatment. Effective treatment strategies in oncology rely on accurate decision-making and early identification of factors associated with positive outcomes. Breast cancer (BC) presents challenges in understanding its contributing factors and establishing precise diagnostic methods. Our research introduces a novel method utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to explore the relationship between various clinical and molecular variables focusing on predicting the status of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- a key aggressiveness biomarker in BC. This objective aligns with leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to support decision-making and address diagnostic considerations during treatment. Four ML models- namely logistic regression- random forest- LightGBM- and CatBoost- were implemented and evaluated using Python. The dataset was compiled by extracting medical records of BC patients- covering the period from 2018 to 2020. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using accuracy- precision- recall- and F1-score as performance metrics. The models achieved varying accuracies between 86.36 and 95.45%. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 90.90% while the random forest and LightGBM models achieved an accuracy of 86.36%. The CatBoost model outperformed others with a greater accuracy of 95.45%- indicating its superior predictive capabilities for HER2 status. The ML models demonstrated potential in predicting HER2 status- enabling early detection and facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Our findings emphasize the significance of AI and ML techniques in improving BC outcomes and guiding decision-making. Further research is required to explore the broader applications of ML in predicting comprehensive BC outcomes in diverse healthcare settings and among heterogeneous populations.
Ruth Moulson- Guillaume Feugâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚Â¬Â¨âˆšÃœre- Tracy S Moreira-Lucas- Florence Dequen- Jessica Weiss- Janet Smith- Christine Brezden-Masley,Real-World Treatment Patterns and Clinical Outcomes among Patients Receiving CDK4/6 Inhibitors for Metastatic Breast Cancer in a Canadian Setting Using AI-Extracted Data,The study aimed to develop natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to automate extracting patient-centred breast cancer treatment outcomes from clinical notes in electronic health records (EHRs)- particularly for women from under-represented populations. The study used clinical notes from 2010 to 2021 from a tertiary hospital in the USA. The notes were processed through various NLP techniques- including vectorisation methods (term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)- Word2Vec- Doc2Vec) and classification models (support vector classification- K-nearest neighbours (KNN)- random forest (RF)). Feature selection and optimisation through random search and fivefold cross-validation were also conducted. The study annotated 100 out of 1000 clinical notes- using 970 notes to build the text corpus. TF-IDF and Doc2Vec combined with RF showed the highest performance- while Word2Vec was less effective. RF classifier demonstrated the best performance- although with lower recall rates- suggesting more false negatives. KNN showed lower recall due to its sensitivity to data noise. The study highlights the significance of using NLP in analysing clinical notes to understand breast cancer treatment outcomes in under-represented populations. The TF-IDF and Doc2Vec models were more effective in capturing relevant information than Word2Vec. The study observed lower recall rates in RF models- attributed to the dataset's imbalanced nature and the complexity of clinical notes. The study developed high-performing NLP pipeline to capture treatment outcomes for breast cancer in under-represented populations- demonstrating the importance of document-level vectorisation and ensemble methods in clinical notes analysis. The findings provide insights for more equitable healthcare strategies and show the potential for broader NLP applications in clinical settings.
Debanjan Mukherjee- Sarjana Raikwar,Recent Update on Nanocarrier(s) as the Targeted Therapy for Breast Cancer,The objective is to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing ultrasound images in identifying critical prognostic biomarkers for HER2-positive breast cancer (HER2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢+â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢BC). This study enrolled 512 female patients diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer through pathological validation at our institution from January 2016 to December 2021. Five distinct deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a deep ensemble (DE) approach were trained to classify axillary lymph node involvement (ALNM)- lymphovascular invasion (LVI)- and histological grade (HG). The efficacy of the models was evaluated based on accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- positive predictive value (PPV)- negative predictive value (NPV)- receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves- areas under the ROC curve (AUCs)- and heat maps. DeLong test was applied to compare differences in AUC among different models. The deep ensemble approach- as the most effective model- demonstrated AUCs and accuracy of 0.869 (95% CI: 0.802-0.936) and 69.7% in LVI- 0.973 (95% CI: 0.949-0.998) and 73.8% in HG- thus providing superior classification performance in the context of imbalanced data (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05 by the DeLong test). On ALNM- AUC and accuracy were 0.780 (95% CI: 0.688-0.873) and 77.5%- which were comparable to other single models. The pretreatment US-based DE model could hold promise as a clinical guidance for predicting pathological characteristics of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer- thereby providing benefit of facilitating timely adjustments in treatment strategies.
Manar Aljabri- Manal Al Ghamdi- F. Collado-Mesa- Mohamed Abdel-Mottaleb,Recurrent attention U-Net for segmentation and quantification of breast arterial calcifications on synthesized 2D mammograms,Breast cancer is the most common cancer diagnosed in women and causes over 40-000 deaths annually in the United States. In early-stage- HR+- HER2- invasive breast cancer- the Oncotype DX (ODX) Breast Cancer Recurrence Score Test predicts the risk of recurrence and the benefit of chemotherapy. However- this gene assay is costly and time-consuming- making it inaccessible to many patients. This study proposes a novel deep-learning approach- Deep-ODX- which performs ODX recurrence risk prediction based on routine H&E histopathology images. Deep-ODX is a multiple-instance learning model that leverages a cross-attention neural network- for instance- aggregation. We train and evaluate Deep-ODX on a whole slide image dataset collected from 151 breast cancer patients. As a result- Deep-ODX achieves 0.862 AUC on our dataset- outperforming the existing deep learning models. This study indicates that deep learning methods can predict ODX results from histopathology images- offering a potentially cost-effective prognostic solution with broader accessibility.

Desh Deepak Singh- Shafiul Haque- Youngsun Kim- Ihn Han- Dharmendra Kumar Yadav,Remodeling of tumour microenvironment: strategies to overcome therapeutic resistance and innovate immunoengineering in triple-negative breast cancer,Breast cancer ranks as the most prevalent cancer among women globally. Histopathological image analysis stands as one of the most reliable methods for tumor detection. This study aims to utilize deep learning to extract histopathological features and automatically identify tumor information- thereby assisting doctors in high-precision pathological diagnosis. This study proposes a dual-stream global-local network (DSGLNet) for breast cancer histopathological image classification. The proposed DSGLNet employs a dual-stream feature extraction architecture that leverages a convolutional network to extract local image features and employs graph convolutional mapping to construct a global feature interaction space for capturing global information. By deeply integrating both local and global features- the network achieves precise image classification. Additionally- image preprocessing through feature engineering normalizes image colors and enhances the details of tissue cell boundaries. The proposed DSGLNet model was thoroughly evaluated on the publicly available BreakHis dataset- encompassing different magnification levels for the identification of tumor nature and tumor types. The 40 magnification histopathological images achieved the best diagnostic results- with the identification of tumor nature reaching 0.966 accuracy and 0.973 precision- outperforming other advanced methods.
Faten Essam Hussain Aldoghachi- Amjad Oraibi- Noor Hamid Mohsen- Sara Salah Hassan,Repurposing Phytochemicals against Breast Cancer (MCF-7) using Classical Structure-Based Drug Design,Imaging features (radiomics) have potential for predicting Triple Negative Breast Cancer and other subtypes using magnetic resonance images (MRI). This work uses 244 images from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset to investigate the complex interplay between radiomics feature stability- with respect to segmentation variability- and prediction results of machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that features demonstrating high stability across different segmentations tend to enhance model performance- whereas unstable features sensitive to small segmentation changes degrade predictive accuracy. This exploration underscores the importance of feature stability in the development of reliable models for breast cancer subtype classification.
Zhidong Huang- Kaixin Lou- Mengyang Qi- Jinhui Wang- Linwei Li- Bo Sun- Chen Wang- Xirui Zhou- Debo Chen- Hong Liu,RERE-AS1 enhances the effect of CDK4/6 inhibitor Ribociclib and suppresses malignant phenotype in breast cancer via MEK/ERK pathway,Molecular profiling of estrogen receptor (ER)- progesterone receptor (PR)- and ERBB2 (also known as Her2) is essential for breast cancer diagnosis and treatment planning. Nevertheless- current methods rely on the qualitative interpretation of immunohistochemistry and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)- which can be costly- time-consuming- and inconsistent. Here we explore the clinical utility of predicting receptor status from digitized hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) slides using machine learning trained and evaluated on a multi-institutional dataset. We developed a deep learning system to predict ER- PR- and ERBB2 statuses from digitized H&E slides and evaluated its utility in three clinical applications: identifying hormone receptor-positive patients- serving as a second-read tool for quality assurance- and addressing intratumor heterogeneity. For development and validation- we collected 19-845 slides from 7-950 patients across six independent cohorts representative of diverse clinical settings. Here we show that the system identifies 30.5% of patients as hormone receptor-positive- achieving a specificity of 0.9982 and a positive predictive value of 0.9992- demonstrating its ability to determine eligibility for hormone therapy without immunohistochemistry. By restaining and reassessing samples flagged as potential false negatives- we discover 31 cases of misdiagnosed ER- PR- and ERBB2 statuses. These findings demonstrate the utility of the system in diverse clinical settings and its potential to improve breast cancer diagnosis. Given the substantial focus of current guidelines on reducing false negative diagnoses- this study supports the integration of H&E-based machine learning tools into workflows for quality assurance.
Rashed Al Amin- Roman Obermaisser,Resource-Efficient FPGA Implementation for Real-Time Breast Cancer Classification Using Custom CNNs,BACKGROUND This study evaluated the accuracy- clinical concordance- and readability of the chatbot interface generative pretrained transformer (ChatGPT) 3.5 as a source of breast cancer information for patients. METHODS Twenty questions that patients are likely to ask ChatGPT were identified by breast cancer advocates. These were posed to ChatGPT 3.5 in July 2023 and were repeated three times. Responses were graded in two domains: accuracy (4-point Likert scale- 4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ worst) and clinical concordance (information is clinically similar to physician response; 5-point Likert scale- 5Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ not similar at all). The concordance of responses with repetition was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of word counts. Response readability was calculated using the Flesch Kincaid readability scale. References were requested and verified. RESULTS The overall average accuracy was 1.88 (range 1.0-3.0; 95% confidence interval [CI]- 1.42-1.94)- and clinical concordance was 2.79 (range 1.0-5.0; 95% CI- 1.94-3.64). The average word count was 310 words per response (range- 146-441 words per response) with high concordance (ICC- 0.75; 95% CI- 0.59-0.91; pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ <Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ .001). The average readability was poor at 37.9 (range- 18.0-60.5) with high concordance (ICC- 0.73; 95% CI- 0.57-0.90; pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ <Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ .001). There was a weak correlation between ease of readability and better clinical concordance (-0.15; pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ .025). Accuracy did not correlate with readability (0.05; pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ .079). The average number of references was 1.97 (range- 1-4; total- 119). ChatGPT cited peer-reviewed articles only once and often referenced nonexistent websites (41%). CONCLUSIONS Because ChatGPT 3.5 responses were incorrect 24% of the time and did not provide real references 41% of the time- patients should be cautioned about using ChatGPT for medical information.
BioMed Research International,Retracted: Detection of Breast Cancer Using Histopathological Image Classification Dataset with Deep Learning Techniques,Of patients with early-stage breast cancer- 60% to 75% undergo breast-conserving surgery. Of those- 20% or more need a second surgery because of an incomplete tumor resection only discovered days after surgery. An intraoperative imaging technology allowing cancer detection on the margins of breast specimens could reduce re-excision procedure rates and improve patient survival. We aimed to develop an experimental protocol using hyperspectral line-scanning Raman spectroscopy to image fresh breast specimens from cancer patients. Our objective was to determine whether macroscopic specimen images could be produced to distinguish invasive breast cancer from normal tissue structures. A hyperspectral inelastic scattering imaging instrument was used to interrogate eight specimens from six patients undergoing breast cancer surgery. Machine learning models trained with a different system to distinguish cancer from normal breast structures were used to produce tissue maps with a field-of-view of 1â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢cm2 classifying each pixel as either cancer- adipose- or other normal tissues. The predictive model results were compared with spatially correlated histology maps of the specimens. A total of eight specimens from six patients were imaged. Four of the hyperspectral images were associated with specimens containing cancer cells that were correctly identified by the new ex vivo pathology technique. The images associated with the remaining four specimens had no histologically detectable cancer cells- and this was also correctly predicted by the instrument. We showed the potential of hyperspectral Raman imaging as an intraoperative breast cancer margin assessment technique that could help surgeons improve cosmesis and reduce the number of repeat procedures in breast cancer surgery.

This study aims to identify novel BC subtypes based on PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) and construct a robust prognostic model to guide individualized treatment strategies. The transcriptome data along with clinical data of BC patients were sourced from the TCGA and GEO databases. Consensus clustering was performed on 12 PRGs to ascertain potential BC subtypes- and variances in survival- infiltration of immune cells- and functional pathways among them were examined. A prognostic model was generated through 101 combinations of machine learning algorithms and validated across multiple cohorts. The response of patients towards immunotherapy were analyzed using multiple frameworks. Consensus clustering of 12 PRGs identified two distinct BC subtypes- with subtype B exhibiting significantly lower overall survival (OS) rates compared to subtype A. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed higher immune activity in subtype A. Functional pathway analysis revealed that subtype A exhibited a significant enrichment in immune-related pathways- while subtype B was associated with cell cycle and metabolic processes. An integrated machine learning framework integrating CoxBoost and Random Survival Forest (RSF) algorithms was developed- demonstrating high predictive performance across multiple cohorts. A nomogram combining age and risk score was constructed- showing excellent predictive performance. Immune landscape analysis revealed that the high-risk group exhibited a suppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). Immunotherapy response prediction suggested that low-risk patients were more likely to benefit from PD-1 and CTLA-4 inhibitors. Our study provides a comprehensive framework for BC subtype classification and prognostic prediction- offering valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies.
Yanfeng Li- Wengxing Long- Hongda Zhou- Tao Tan- Hui Xie,Revolutionizing breast cancer Ki-67 diagnosis: ultrasound radiomics and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) combination method,High breast density found using mammographs (MGs) reduces positivity rates and is considered a risk factor for breast cancer. Research on the relationship between Volpara density grade (VDG) and compressed breast thickness (CBT) in the Japanese population is still lacking. Moreover- little attention has been paid to pseudo-dense breasts with CBT < 30 mm among high-density breasts. We investigated VDG- CBT- and apparent high breast density in patients with breast cancer. Women who underwent MG and breast cancer surgery at our institution were included. VDG and CBT were measured. VDG was divided into a non-dense group (NDG) and a dense group (DG). This study included 419 patients. VDG was negatively correlated with CBT. The DG included younger patients with lower body mass index (BMI) and thinner CBT. In the DG- patients with CBT < 30 mm had lower BMI and higher VDG; however- no significant difference was noted in the positivity rate of the two groups. Younger women tend to have higher breast density- resulting in thinner CBT- which may pose challenges in detecting breast cancer on MGs. However- there was no significant difference in the breast cancer detection rate between CBT < 30 mm and CBT â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 30 mm.
Qingmei Huang- Xuqian Zong- Changrong Yuan- Meimei Shang- Rong Yan- Yeping Zheng- Meie Niu- Yang Yang- Fulei Wu,Risk factors for self-reported high symptom cluster burdens in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in China: A cross-sectional study,To develop machine learning models based on preoperative dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) radiomics and to explore their potential prognostic value in the differential diagnosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low from HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). A total of 233 patients with pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer admitted to our hospital between January 2018 and December 2022 were included in this retrospective analysis. Of these- 103 cases were diagnosed as HER2-positive and 130 cases were HER2 low-expression BC. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is employed to address the class imbalance problem. Patients were randomly split into a training set (163 cases) and a validation set (70 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features from DCE-MRI second-phase imaging were extracted. Z-score normalization was used to standardize the radiomics features- and Pearson's correlation coefficient and recursive feature elimination were used to explore the significant features. Prediction models were constructed using 6 machine learning algorithms: logistic regression- random forest- support vector machine- AdaBoost- decision tree- and auto-encoder. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed- and predictive models were evaluated according to the area under the curve (AUC)- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity. In the training set- the AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity of all models were 1.000. However- in the validation set- the auto-encoder model's AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity were 0.994- 0.976- 0.972- and 0.978- respectively. The remaining models' AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity were 1.000. The DeLong test showed no statistically significant differences between the machine learning models in the training and validation sets (Zâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±0- Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±1). Our study investigated the feasibility of using DCE-MRI-based radiomics features to predict HER2-low BC. Certain radiomics features showed associations with HER2-low BC and may have predictive value. Machine learning prediction models developed using these radiomics features could be beneficial for distinguishing between HER2-low and HER2-positive BC. These noninvasive preoperative models have the potential to assist in clinical decision-making for HER2-low breast cancer- thereby advancing personalized clinical precision.
Arezou Ashari- Neda SoleimanvandiAzar- Marzieh Nojomi- Hadi Ranjbar- Kamran Mirzaei- Nahid Nafissi- Mahshid Roohravan Benis- Zahra Rampisheh,Risk perception regarding social determinants of health among women with breast cancer in Iran: a qualitative study,Early screening of breast cancer through image recognition technology can significantly increase the survival rate of patients. Therefore- breast cancer pathological image is of great significance for medical diagnosis and clinical research. In recent years- numerous deep learning models have been applied to breast cancer image classification- with deep CNN being a typical representative. Due to the use of multi-depth small convolutional kernels in mainstream CNN architectures such as VGG and Inception- the obtained image features often have high dimensionality. Although high dimensionality can bring more fine-grained features- it also increases the computational complexity of subsequent classifiers and may even lead to the curse of dimensionality and overfitting. To address these issues- a novel embedded kernel CNN principal component feature fusion (CNN-PCFF) algorithm is proposed. The constructed kernel function is embedded in the principal component analysis to form the multi-kernel principal component. Multi-kernel principal component analysis is used to fuse the high dimensional features obtained from the convolution base into some representative comprehensive variables- which are called kernel principal components- so as to achieve the purpose of dimensionality reduction. Any type of classifier can be added based on multi-kernel principal components. Through experimental analysis on two public breast cancer image datasets- the results show that the proposed algorithm can improve the performance of the current mainstream CNN architecture and subsequent classifiers. Therefore- the proposed algorithm in this paper is an effective tool for the classification of breast cancer pathological images.
Sicheng Zhou- Anne Blaes- Chetan Shenoy- Ju Sun- Rui Zhang,Risk prediction of heart diseases in patients with breast cancer: A deep learning approach with longitudinal electronic health records data,Breast cancer is a common disease that causes great health concerns to women worldwide. During the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer- medical imaging plays an essential role- but its interpretation relies on radiologists or clinical doctors. Radiomics can extract high-throughput quantitative imaging features from images of various modalities via traditional machine learning or deep learning methods following a series of standard processes. Hopefully- radiomic models may aid various processes in clinical practice. In this review- we summarize the current utilization of radiomics for predicting clinicopathological indices and clinical outcomes. We also focus on radio-multi-omics studies that bridge the gap between phenotypic and microscopic scale information. Acknowledging the deficiencies that currently hinder the clinical adoption of radiomic models- we discuss the underlying causes of this situation and propose future directions for advancing radiomics in breast cancer research.
Muhammad Usman Tariq- Muhammad Afnan Siddiqui- Nasir Ud Din- Naila Kayani,Role of SOX10 Immunohistochemical Expression in Diagnosing Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Its Correlation With Clinicopathological Features,The objective of this study was to develop a deep learning-and-radiomics-based ultrasound nomogram for the evaluation of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis risk in breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years. The study enrolled breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years who underwent either sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. DenseNet-201 was employed as the base model- and it was trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function to extract deep learning (DL) features from ultrasound images. Additionally- radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images utilizing the Pyradiomics tool- and a Rad-Score (RS) was calculated employing the Lasso regression algorithm. A stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted in the training set to establish a prediction model for lymph node metastasis- which was subsequently validated in the validation set. Evaluation metrics included area under the curve (AUC)- accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- positive predictive value- negative predictive value- and F1-score. The calibration of the model's performance and its clinical prediction accuracy were assessed using calibration curves and decision curves respectively. Furthermore- integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement were utilized to quantify enhancements in RS. Histological grade- axillary ultrasound- and RS were identified as independent risk factors for predicting lymph node metastasis. The integration of the RS into the clinical prediction model significantly improved its predictive performance- with an AUC of 0.937 in the training set- surpassing both the clinical model and the RS model alone. In the validation set- the integrated model also outperformed other models with AUCs of 0.906- 0.744- and 0.890 for the integrated model- clinical model- and RS model respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that this study's integrated prediction model could enhance both accuracy and generalizability. The DL and radiomics-based model exhibited remarkable accuracy and reliability in predicting ALN status among breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years- thereby contributing to the enhancement of personalized treatment strategies' efficacy and improvement of patients' quality of life.

In this study- we propose an advanced Computer-Aided Detection (CAD) system that harnesses the power of vision transformers to augment DBT's diagnostic efficiency. This scheme uses a neural network to glean attributes from the 2D slices of DBT followed by post-processing that considers features from neighboring slices to categorize the entire 3D scan. By leveraging a transfer learning technique- we trained and validated our CAD framework on a unique dataset consisting of 3-831 DBT scans and subsequently tested it on 685 scans. Of the architectures tested- the Swin Transformer outperformed the ResNet101 and vanilla Vision Transformer. It achieved an impressive AUC score of 0.934 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 0.026 at a resolution of 384 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 384. Increasing the image resolution from 224 to 384 not only maintained vital image attributes but also led to a marked improvement in performance (p-value = 0.0003). The Mean Teacher algorithm- a semi-supervised method using both labeled and unlabeled DBT slices- showed no significant improvement over the supervised approach. Comprehensive analyses across different lesion types- sizes- and patient ages revealed consistent performance. The integration of attention mechanisms yielded a visual narrative of the model's decision-making process that highlighted the prioritized regions during assessments. These findings should significantly propel the methodologies employed in DBT image analysis by setting a new benchmark for breast cancer diagnostic precision.

This study retrospectively included 541 patients (mean age- 51 years; range- 26-82) who underwent a screening breast MRI between November 2016 and September 2018 and who were subsequently diagnosed with biopsy-confirmed- treatment-naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve breast cancer. Patients were divided into training (n = 250) and validation (n = 291) sets. In the training set- 132 radiomic features were extracted using the open-source CERR platform. Following feature selection- the final prediction model was created- based on a support vector machine with a polynomial kernel of order 2. In the validation set- the final prediction model- which included four radiomic features- achieved an F1 score of 0.66- an area under the curve of 0.71- a sensitivity of 54% [47-60%]- a specificity of 74% [65-84%]- a positive predictive value of 84% [78-90%]- and a negative predictive value of 39% [31-47%]. TNBC can be predicted based on radiomic features extracted from the FGT of the contralateral unaffected breast of patients- suggesting the potential for risk prediction specific to TNBC.

Methods: This multi-center retrospective study included pre-NAC clinical pathology data from 698 LABC patients. Post-operative pathological outcomes divided patients into tpCR and non-tpCR groups. Data from 586 patients at Shanghai Ruijin Hospital were randomly assigned to a training set (80%) and a test set (20%). In comparison- data from our hospital's remaining 112 patients were used for external validation. Variable selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression analysis. Predictive models were constructed using six ML algorithms: decision trees- K-nearest neighbors (KNN)- support vector machine- light gradient boosting machine- and extreme gradient boosting. Model efficacy was assessed through various metrics- including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves- precision-recall (PR) curves- confusion matrices- calibration plots- and decision curve analysis (DCA). The best-performing model was selected by comparing the performance of different algorithms. Moreover- variable relevance was ranked using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) technique to improve the interpretability of the model and solve the ""black box"" problem. Results: A total of 191 patients (32.59%) achieved tpCR following NAC. Through LASSO regression analysis- five variables were identified as predictive factors for model construction- including tumor size- Ki-67- molecular subtype- targeted therapy- and chemotherapy regimen. The KNN model outperformed the other five classifier algorithms- achieving area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.847 (95% CI: 0.809-0.883) in the training set- 0.763 (95% CI: 0.670-0.856) in the test set- and 0.665 (95% CI: 0.555-0.776) in the external validation set. DCA demonstrated that the KNN model yielded the highest net advantage through a wide range of threshold probabilities in both the training and test sets. Furthermore- the analysis of the KNN model utilizing SHAP technology demonstrated that targeted therapy is the most crucial factor in predicting tpCR. Conclusion: An ML prediction model using clinical and pathological data collected before NAC was developed and verified. This model accurately predicted the probability of achieving a tpCR in patients with LABC after receiving NAC. SHAP technology enhanced the interpretability of the model and assisted in clinical decision-making and therapy optimization."

In the present study- an integrated metaheuristic machine learning approach-based predictive model was developed that can classify breast cancer into subgroups using clinicopathological data acquired from tertiary care hospitals or oncological institutes. Monkey king evolution (MKE) was utilized to refine the hyperparameters of the support vector machine to achieve optimal settings- and genetic algorithm (GA) was used to choose the pertinent clinical and pathological attributes involved in classification before being applied to the support vector machine (SVM) classifier for prediction. A comparison was conducted between the results of the integrated MKE-GA-SVM model and those derived from conventional feature selection and hyperparameter tuning models such as GA-SVM- grid search-SVM- and SVM-recursive feature elimination (RFE). The effectiveness of the results was evaluated by applying the 10-fold cross-validation technique to the three multicentre datasets across all models. The integrated machine learning (ML) model achieved classification accuracies of 91.4%- 86.6%- and 75.5% across three clinicopathological breast cancer datasets- outperforming the existing models. The generated model performance was also assessed with notable metrics- namely F1-score- precision-recall curve- area under the ROC curve- mean square error and logarithmic loss. Thus- the newly developed bio-inspired integrated metaheuristic model may be deployed as a surrogate diagnostic tool that allows clinicians to offer patients with better therapeutic outcomes.

However- the opacity surrounding private datasets and the unclear methodology behind the selection of subset images from publicly available databases for model training and testing- coupled with the arbitrary incompleteness or inaccessibility of code- markedly intensifies the obstacles in replicating and validating the model's efficacy. These challenges- in turn- erect barriers for subsequent researchers striving to learn and advance this field. To address these limitations- we provide a pilot codebase covering the entire process from image preprocessing to model development and evaluation pipeline- utilizing the publicly available Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) mass subset- including both full images and regions of interests (ROIs). We have identified that increasing the input size could improve the detection accuracy of malignant cases within each set of models. Collectively- our efforts hold promise in accelerating global software development for breast cancer diagnosis by leveraging our codebase and structure- while also integrating other advancements in the field.
Matthias Hans Belau- Lisa Jung- Tabea Maurer- Nadia Obi- Sabine Behrens- Petra Seibold- Heiko Becher- Jenny Chang-Claude,Social relationships and their impact on health-related quality of life in a long-term breast cancer survivor cohort,Machine learning classifiers are increasingly used to create predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Few studies have compared the effectiveness of different ML classifiers. This study evaluated radiomics models based on pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1 weighted images (T1WI) in predicting breast cancer pCR after NAT and compared the performance of ML classifiers. This retrospective study enrolled 281 patients undergoing NAT from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset. Radiomic features were extracted from pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1WI images. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied- then the dataset was randomly divided into training and validation groups (7:3). The radiomics model was built using selected optimal features. Support vector machine (SVM)- random forest (RF)- decision tree (DT)- k-nearest neighbor (KNN)- extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)- and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were classifiers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive performance. LightGBM performed best in predicting pCR [area under the curve (AUC): 0.823- 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.743-0.902]- accuracy 74.0%- sensitivity 85.0%- specificity 67.2%]. During subgroup analysis- RF was most effective in pCR prediction in luminal breast cancers (AUC: 0.914- 95% CI [0.847-0.981]- accuracy 87.0%- sensitivity 85.2%- specificity 88.1%). In triple-negative breast cancers- LightGBM performed best (AUC: 0.836- 95% CI [0.708-0.965]- accuracy 78.6%- sensitivity 68.2%- specificity 90.0%). The LightGBM-based radiomics model performed best in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer. RF and LightGBM showed promising results for luminal and triple-negative breast cancers- respectively.

Materials and Methods The BMMR2 computational challenge opened on May 28- 2021- and closed on December 21- 2021. The goal of the challenge was to identify image-based markers derived from multiparametric breast MRI- including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI- along with clinical data for predicting pathologic complete response (pCR) following neoadjuvant treatment. Data included 573 breast MRI studies from 191 women (mean age [Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±SD]- 48.9 years Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 10.56) in the I-SPY 2/American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN) 6698 trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01042379). The challenge cohort was split into training (60%) and test (40%) sets- with teams blinded to test set pCR outcomes. Prediction performance was evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and compared with the benchmark established from the ACRIN 6698 primary analysis. Results Eight teams submitted final predictions. Entries from three teams had point estimators of AUC that were higher than the benchmark performance (AUC- 0.782 [95% CI: 0.670- 0.893]- with AUCs of 0.803 [95% CI: 0.702- 0.904]- 0.838 [95% CI: 0.748- 0.928]- and 0.840 [95% CI: 0.748- 0.932]). A variety of approaches were used- ranging from extraction of individual features to deep learning and artificial intelligence methods- incorporating DCE and DWI alone or in combination. Conclusion The BMMR2 challenge identified several models with high predictive performance- which may further expand the value of multiparametric breast MRI as an early marker of treatment response.

However- current detection methods- such as X-rays- ultrasound- CT scans- MRI- and mammography- have their limitations. Recently- with the advancements in precision medicine and technologies like artificial intelligence- liquid biopsy- specifically utilizing Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS)- has emerged as a promising approach to detect breast cancer. Liquid biopsy- as a minimally invasive technique- can provide a temporal reflection of breast cancer occurrence and progression- along with a spatial representation of overall tumor information. SERS has been extensively employed for biomarker detection- owing to its numerous advantages such as high sensitivity- minimal sample requirements- strong multi-detection ability- and controllable background interference. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the latest research on the application of SERS in the detection of breast cancer biomarkers- including exosomes- circulating tumor cells (CTCs)- miRNA- proteins and others. The aim of this review is to provide valuable insights into the potential of SERS technology for early breast cancer diagnosis.

Purpose To assess whether AISmartDensity-an AI-based score integrating cancer signs- masking- and risk-surpasses measurements of mammographic density in identifying patients for supplemental breast imaging after a negative screening mammogram. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included randomly selected individuals who underwent screening mammography at Karolinska University Hospital between January 2008 and December 2015. The models in AISmartDensity were trained and validated using nonoverlapping data. The ability of AISmartDensity to identify future cancer in patients with a negative screening mammogram was evaluated and compared with that of mammographic density models. Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for the top 8% of scores- mimicking the proportion of patients in the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System ""extremely dense"" category. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and was compared using the DeLong test.

Bakitas,Telephone-Based Rehabilitation Intervention to Optimize Activity Participation After Breast Cancer,A novel you only look once (YOLO)-based gated attention deep convolution network (GADCN) classification algorithm is developed and utilized in this present study for the detection of breast cancer. In this framework- contrast enhancement-based histogram equalization is applied initially to produce the normalized breast image with reduced noise artifacts. Then- the breast region is accurately segmented from the preprocessed images with low complexity and segmentation error using the YOLO-based attention network model. To diagnose breast cancer with better accuracy- the GADCN model is used to predict the exact class of image (i.e.- benign or malignant). During classification- the activation function is optimally computed with the use of the Lichtenberg optimization algorithm (LOA). It aids in achieving improved classification performance with little complexity in training and assessment. The significance of the present study includes the use of a unique- YOLO-based GADCN-LOA model that helps in the prediction of breast cancer with higher accuracy. It was observed that the model exhibited 99% accuracy for the datasets utilized. In addition- the selected model outperforms well with sensitivity- specificity- precision- and F1-score. Hence the proposed model could be exploited for the diagnosis of breast cancer at an early stage to enable preventive care.

However- the heterogeneous form of data and uneven distribution of targets make drug discovery and precision medicine a non-trivial task. This study takes pyroptosis therapy for triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) as a paradigm and uses data mining of a large TNBC cohort and drug databases to establish a biofactor-regulated neural network for rapidly screening and optimizing compound pyroptosis drug pairs. Subsequently- biomimetic nanococrystals are prepared using the preferred combination of mitoxantrone and gambogic acid for rational drug delivery. The unique mechanism of obtained nanococrystals regulating pyroptosis genes through ribosomal stress and triggering pyroptosis cascade immune effects are revealed in TNBC models. In this work- a target omics-based intelligent compound drug discovery framework explores an innovative drug development paradigm- which repurposes existing drugs and enables precise treatment of refractory diseases.

Radiomics and artificial intelligence can be of great help here. Quantitative and qualitative assessments obtained in this way act as decision support for the physician. The aim of the study is to enhance the ability of quantitative and qualitative assessment of metastatic spinal lesions in breast cancer- to better evaluate the nature of changes under the influence of therapy- in addition to MDA. We used MRI data in sagittal projection for a patient diagnosed with T2N3M1 breast cancer when treated according to accepted clinical protocols. Metastases to the spine were assessed by a radiologist and by machine analysis using the described software: image internal structure extraction operators and recognition based on traditional neural networks. Fragments of the program codes used are also given. The structure of metastatically changed vertebrae in sagittal projection was analysed using machine operators of image analysis. Subtle changes in structure such as several types of ""calderas"" and the pattern of change in image complexity as treatment with CDK 4/6 inhibitors were detected. Measurements were supported by metastasis recognition using neural networks- to increase the reliability of the estimates. In addition to the ability to record response to therapy- a fundamental ability to assess the degree of action compared to previous therapy was identified. The study showed high efficiency of using image structure analysis algorithms- good correlation of the results obtained with the radiologist's opinion and with clinical and laboratory data- and allowed to approach the analysis of subtle effects to obtain not only quantitative characteristics in addition to MDA- but also to obtain new qualitative results."

Fujima- Kenji Hirata- Takeshi Nakaura- U. Tateishi- Shinji Naganawa,The Evolution and Clinical Impact of Deep Learning Technologies in Breast MRI.,The Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2 (HER2) is one of the aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. The HER2 status decides the requirement of breast cancer patients to receive HER2-targeted therapy. The HER2 testing involves combining Immunohistochemistry (IHC) screening- followed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for cases where IHC results are equivocal. These tests may involve multiple trials- are time intensive- and tend to be more expensive for certain classes of people. Hematoxylin and Eosin (HE) staining is employed for visualizing general tissue morphology and is a routine- cost-effective method. In this study- we introduce a novel automated class-wise weighted average ensemble deep learning algorithm at the decision level. The proposed algorithm fuses three pre-trained deep-learning models at the decision level by assigning a weight to each class based on their performance of the model to classify the HE-stained breast histopathology images into multi-class HER2 statuses as HER2-0+- HER2-1+- HER2-2+- and HER2-3+. The class-wise weight allocation to the base classifiers is one of the key features of the proposed algorithm. The presented framework surpasses all the existing methods currently employed on the Breast Cancer Immunohistochemistry (BCI) dataset- establishing itself as a dependable approach for detecting HER2 status from HE-stained images. This study highlights the robustness of the proposed algorithm as well as the sufficient information encapsulated within HE-stained images for the effective detection of the HER2 protein present in breast cancer. Therefore- the proposed method possesses the potential to sideline the need for IHC laboratory tests- which hoard time and money.
Olya Rezaeian- Onur Asan- A. E. Bayrak,The Impact of AI Explanations on Clinicians Trust and Diagnostic Accuracy in Breast Cancer,Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) is the most prevalent form of breast cancer. Breast tissue histopathological examination is critical in diagnosing and classifying breast cancer. Although existing methods have shown promising results- there is still room for improvement in the classification accuracy and generalization of IDC using histopathology images. We present a novel approach- Supervised Contrastive Vision Transformer (SupCon-ViT)- for improving the classification of invasive ductal carcinoma in terms of accuracy and generalization by leveraging the inherent strengths and advantages of both transfer learning- i.e.- pre-trained vision transformer- and supervised contrastive learning. Our results on a benchmark breast cancer dataset demonstrate that SupCon-ViT achieves state-of-the-art performance in IDC classification- with an F1-score of 0.8188- precision of 0.7692- and specificity of 0.8971- outperforming existing methods. In addition- the proposed model demonstrates resilience in scenarios with minimal labeled data- making it highly efficient in real-world clinical settings where labeled data is limited. Our findings suggest that supervised contrastive learning in conjunction with pre-trained vision transformers appears to be a viable strategy for an accurate classification of IDC- thus paving the way for a more efficient and reliable diagnosis of breast cancer through histopathological image analysis.
Chengdong Yu- Jiawei Xu- Siyi Xu- Lei Tang- Xiaofang Zhang- Wen Chen- Ting Yu,The impacts of noise and air pollution on breast cancer risk in European and East Asian populations: Insights from genetic evidence,Advances in machine learning have created new opportunities to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based clinical decision support systems using past clinical data and improve diagnosis decisions in life-threatening illnesses such breast cancer. Providing explanations for AI recommendations is a possible way to address trust and usability issues in black-box AI systems. This paper presents the results of an experiment to assess the impact of varying levels of AI explanations on clinicians' trust and diagnosis accuracy in a breast cancer application and the impact of demographics on the findings. The study includes 28 clinicians with varying medical roles related to breast cancer diagnosis. The results show that increasing levels of explanations do not always improve trust or diagnosis performance. The results also show that while some of the self-reported measures such as AI familiarity depend on gender- age and experience- the behavioral assessments of trust and performance are independent of those variables.

This study developed and evaluated predictive models for six heart diseases using real-world electronic health records (EHRs) data. We incorporated a trainable decay mechanism to handle missing values in the long short-term memory (LSTM) model- creating LSTM-D models to predict heart disease risk based on longitudinal EHRs data. Additionally- we deployed NLP methods to extract breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts- integrating unstructured and structured data to enhance predictions. Our LSTM-D models outperformed baseline models in predicting congestive heart failure- coronary artery disease- cardiomyopathy- myocardial infarction- transient ischemic attack- and aortic regurgitation- with AUC scores ranging from 0.7189 to 0.9548. Observation windows of 12-24Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ months were found optimal for model performance.

The objective of this study is to present an automated analysis and classification system for breast cancer using clinical markers such as tumor shape- orientation- margin- and surrounding tissue. The novelty and uniqueness of the study lie in the approach of considering medical features based on the diagnosis of radiologists. Methods Using clinical markers- a graph is generated where each feature is represented by a node- and the connection between them is represented by an edge which is derived through Pearson's correlation method. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model is proposed to classify breast tumors into benign and malignant- using the graph data. Several statistical tests are performed to assess the importance of the proposed features. The performance of the proposed GCN model is improved by experimenting with different layer configurations and hyper-parameter settings. Results Results show that the proposed model has a 98.73% test accuracy. The performance of the model is compared with a graph attention network- a one-dimensional convolutional neural network- and five transfer learning models- ten machine learning models- and three ensemble learning models. The performance of the model was further assessed with three supplementary breast cancer ultrasound image datasets- where the accuracies are 91.03%- 94.37%- and 89.62% for Dataset A- Dataset B- and Dataset C (combining Dataset A and Dataset B) respectively. Overfitting issues are assessed through k-fold cross-validation. Conclusion Several variants are utilized to present a more rigorous and fair evaluation of our work- especially the importance of extracting clinically relevant features. Moreover- a GCN model using graph data can be a promising solution for an automated feature-based breast image classification system.
Wenjuan Gao- Qian Zhang- Dan Wang- Xiaoxu Li- Linping Zhang- Mengjiao Xu- Jing Han,The role expectations of young women as wives after breast cancer treatment: A qualitative study,The objective of this study is to develop a novel diagnostic tool using deep learning and radiomics to distinguish bone tumors on CT images as metastases from breast cancer. By providing a more accurate and reliable method for identifying metastatic bone tumors- this approach aims to significantly improve clinical decision-making and patient management in the context of breast cancer. This study utilized CT images of bone tumors from 178 patients- including 78 cases of breast cancer bone metastases and 100 cases of non-breast cancer bone metastases. The dataset was processed using the Medical Image Segmentation via Self-distilling TransUNet (MISSU) model for automated segmentation. Radiomics features were extracted from the segmented tumor regions using the Pyradiomics library- capturing various aspects of tumor phenotype. Feature selection was conducted using LASSO regression to identify the most predictive features. The model's performance was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation- with metrics including accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- and the Dice similarity coefficient. The developed radiomics model using the SVM algorithm achieved high discriminatory power- with an AUC of 0.936 on the training set and 0.953 on the test set. The model's performance metrics demonstrated strong accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity. Specifically- the accuracy was 0.864 for the training set and 0.853 for the test set. Sensitivity values were 0.838 and 0.789 for the training and test sets- respectively- while specificity values were 0.896 and 0.933 for the training and test sets- respectively. These results indicate that the SVM model effectively distinguishes between bone metastases originating from breast cancer and other origins. Additionally- the average Dice similarity coefficient for the automated segmentation was 0.915- demonstrating a high level of agreement with manual segmentations. This study demonstrates the potential of combining CT-based radiomics and deep learning for the accurate detection of bone metastases from breast cancer. The high-performance metrics indicate that this approach can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy- aiding in early detection and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on validating these findings on larger datasets- integrating the model into clinical workflows- and exploring its use in personalized treatment planning.
Beyzanur Erk- Ali Furkan Kamanli- Gamze Guney Eskiler,The therapeutic efficacy of 5-ALA based photodynamic therapy and chemotherapy combination in triple negative breast cancer cells,"Tumors are an important health concern in modern times. Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent causes of death for women. Breast cancer is rapidly becoming the leading cause of mortality among women globally. Early detection of breast cancer allows patients to obtain appropriate therapy- increasing their probability of survival. The adoption of 3-Dimensional (3D) mammography for the medical identification of abnormalities in the breast reduced the number of deaths dramatically. Classification and accurate detection of lumps in the breast in 3D mammography is especially difficult due to factors such as inadequate contrast and normal fluctuations in tissue density. Several Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) solutions are under development to help radiologists accurately classify abnormalities in the breast. In this paper- a breast cancer diagnosis model is implemented to detect breast cancer in cancer patients to prevent death rates. The 3D mammogram images are gathered from the internet. Then- the gathered images are given to the preprocessing phase. The preprocessing is done using a median filter and image scaling method. The purpose of the preprocessing phase is to enhance the quality of the images and remove any noise or artifacts that may interfere with the detection of abnormalities. The median filter helps to smooth out any irregularities in the images- while the image scaling method adjusts the size and resolution of the images for better analysis. Once the preprocessing is complete- the preprocessed image is given to the segmentation phase. The segmentation phase is crucial in medical image analysis as it helps to identify and separate different structures within the image- such as organs or tumors. This process involves dividing the preprocessed image into meaningful regions or segments based on intensity- color- texture- or other features. The segmentation process is done using Adaptive Thresholding with Region Growing Fusion Model (AT-RGFM)"". This model combines the advantages of both thresholding and region-growing techniques to accurately identify and delineate specific structures within the image. By utilizing AT-RGFM- the segmentation phase can effectively differentiate between different parts of the image- allowing for more precise analysis and diagnosis. It plays a vital role in the medical image analysis process- providing crucial insights for healthcare professionals. Here- the Modified Garter Snake Optimization Algorithm (MGSOA) is used to optimize the parameters. It helps to optimize parameters for accurately identifying and delineating specific structures within medical images and also helps healthcare professionals in providing more precise analysis and diagnosis- ultimately playing a vital role in the medical image analysis process. MGSOA enhances the segmentation phase by effectively differentiating between different parts of the image- leading to more accurate results. Then- the segmented image is fed into the detection phase. The tumor detection is performed by the Vision Transformer-based Multiscale Adaptive EfficientNetB7 (ViT-MAENB7) model. This model utilizes a combination of advanced algorithms and deep learning techniques to accurately identify and locate tumors within the segmented medical image. By incorporating a multiscale adaptive approach- the ViT-MAENB7 model can analyze the image at various levels of detail- improving the overall accuracy of tumor detection. This crucial step in the medical image analysis process allows healthcare professionals to make more informed decisions regarding patient treatment and care. Here- the created MGSOA algorithm is used to optimize the parameters for enhancing the performance of the model. The suggested breast cancer diagnosis performance is compared to conventional cancer diagnosis models and it showed high accuracy. The accuracy of the developed MGSOA-ViT-MAENB7 is 96.6 %- and others model like RNN- LSTM- EffNet- and ViT-MAENet given the accuracy to be 90.31 %- 92.79 %- 94.46 % and 94.75 %. The developed model's ability to analyze images at multiple scales- combined with the optimization provided by the MGSOA algorithm- results in a highly accurate and efficient system for detecting tumors in medical images. This cutting-edge technology not only improves the accuracy of diagnosis but also helps healthcare professionals tailor treatment plans to individual patients- ultimately leading to better outcomes. By outperforming traditional cancer diagnosis models- the proposed model is revolutionizing the field of medical imaging and setting a new standard for precision and effectiveness in healthcare."
Vivianne Freitas- Sandeep Ghai- Frederick Au- Derek Muradali- Supriya Kulkarni,The Transformative Power of Digital Breast Tomosynthesis and Artificial Intelligence in Breast Cancer Diagnosis,CYP2D6 plays a critical role in metabolizing tamoxifen into its active metabolite- endoxifen- which is crucial for its therapeutic effect in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CYP2D6 gene can affect enzyme activity and thus impact tamoxifen efficacy. This study aimed to use machine learning algorithms (MLAs) to identify significant predictors of Breast Cancer-Free Interval (BCFI) and to apply bioinformatics tools to investigate the structural and functional implications of CYP2D6 SNPs. The study utilized data from 4-974 breast cancer patients recruited by the International Tamoxifen Pharmacogenomics Consortium (ITPC)- focusing on 898 patients with available BCFI data. Predictors included age- ethnicity- menopausal status- breast cancer grade- CYP2D6 genotype- and BCFI. An ensemble MLA model was developed- incorporating regression- CHAID- artificial neural networks (ANN)- and classification and regression trees (CART). Bioinformatics tools- such as STRING-DB and GEPIA2- were used to analyze protein-protein interactions and survival data related to CYP2D6. The ensemble model identified age and CYP2D6 genotypes as significant predictors of BCFI. The mean prediction error for the training and testing cohorts was 13.8 and 40.2 days- respectively. Bioinformatics analysis revealed reduced CYP2D6 functional activity associated with decreased survival- and Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that lower CYP2D6 expression significantly reduced survival rates. This study highlights the utility of MLAs in identifying key predictors of tamoxifen response and the value of bioinformatics in understanding CYP2D6's role in breast cancer outcomes. Personalized treatment approaches based on CYP2D6 metabolizer status could enhance tamoxifen therapy effectiveness.
Chao Hua- Chen Wenwen- Rui Huijuan- Pan Ting- Zhang Jin,The value of the malignant subregion-based texture analysis in predicting the Ki-67 status in breast cancer,Manual detection and scoring of Ki67 hotspots is difficult and prone to variability- limiting its clinical utility. Automated hotspot detection and scoring by digital image analysis (DIA) could improve the assessment of the Ki67 hotspot proliferation index (PI). This study compared the clinical performance of Ki67 hotspot detection and scoring DIA algorithms based on virtual dual staining (VDS) and deep learning (DL) with manual Ki67 hotspot PI assessment. Tissue sections of 135 consecutive invasive breast carcinomas were immunohistochemically stained for Ki67. Two DIA algorithms- based on VDS and DL- automatically determined the Ki67 hotspot PI. For manual assessment; two independent observers detected hotspots and calculated scores using a validated scoring protocol. Automated hotspot detection and assessment by VDS and DL could be performed in 73% and 100% of the cases- respectively. Automated hotspot detection by VDS and DL led to higher Ki67 hotspot PIs (mean 39.6% and 38.3%- respectively) compared to manual consensus Ki67 PIs (mean 28.8%). Comparing manual consensus Ki67 PIs with VDS Ki67 PIs revealed substantial correlation (râ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.90)- while manual consensus versus DL Ki67 PIs demonstrated high correlation (râ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.95). Automated Ki67 hotspot detection and analysis correlated strongly with manual Ki67 assessment and provided higher PIs compared to manual assessment. The DL-based algorithm outperformed the VDS-based algorithm in clinical applicability- because it did not depend on virtual alignment of slides and correlated stronger with manual scores. Use of a DL-based algorithm may allow clearer Ki67 PI cutoff values- thereby improving the clinical usability of Ki67.

This paper presents a method designed to detect and localize breast cancer using deep learning- specifically convolutional neural networks. The approach classifies histological images of breast tissue as either tumor-positive or tumor-negative. We utilize several deep learning models- including a custom-built CNN- EfficientNet- ResNet50- VGG-16- VGG-19- and MobileNet. Fine-tuning was also applied to VGG-16- VGG-19- and MobileNet to enhance performance. Additionally- we introduce a novel deep learning model called MR_Net- aimed at providing a more accurate network for breast cancer detection and localization- potentially assisting clinicians in making informed decisions. This model could also accelerate the diagnostic process- enabling early detection of the disease. Furthermore- we propose a method for explainable predictions by generating heatmaps that highlight the regions within tissue images that the model focuses on when predicting a label- revealing the detection of benign- atypical- and malignant tumors. We evaluate both the quantitative and qualitative performance of MR_Net and the other models- also presenting explainable results that allow visualization of the tissue areas identified by the model as relevant to the presence of breast cancer.
Pritpal Singh- Rakesh Kumar- Meenu Gupta- Ahmed J. Obaid,Transfer Learning based Breast Cancer Classification using Histopathology Images,BACKGROUND The aim of this study is an improved understanding of drug distribution in brain metastases. Rather than single point snapshots- we analyzed the time course and route of drug/probe elimination (clearance)- focusing on the Intramural Periarterial Drainage (IPAD) pathway. METHODS Mice with JIMT1-BR HER2+ experimental brain metastases were injected with biocytin-TMR and either trastuzumab or human IgG. Drugs/probes circulated for 5 min-48h- followed by perfusion. Brain sections were stained for human IgG- vascular basement membrane proteins laminin or collagen IV- and periarterial â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±-SMA. A machine learning algorithm was developed to identify metastases- metastatic microenvironment- and uninvolved brain in confocally scanned brain sections. Drug/probe intensity over time and total imaged drug exposure (iAUC) were calculated for 27-249 lesions and co-immunofluorescence with IPAD- vascular matrix analyzed in 11-668 metastases. RESULTS In metastases- peak trastuzumab levels were 5-fold higher than human IgG but 4-fold less than biocytin-TMR. The elimination phase constituted 85-93% of total iAUC for all drugs/probes tested. For trastuzumab- total iAUC during uptake was similar to the small molecule drug probe biocytin-TMR- but slower trastuzumab elimination resulted in a 1.7-fold higher total iAUC. During elimination trastuzumab and IgG were preferentially enriched in the â€šÃ¢Ã âˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±-SMA+ periarterial vascular matrix- consistent with the IPAD clearance route; biocytin-TMR showed heterogeneous elimination pathways. CONCLUSIONS Drug/probe elimination is an important component of drug development for brain metastases. We identified a prolonged elimination pathway for systemically administered antibodies through the periarterial vascular matrix that may contribute to the sustained presence and efficacy of large antibody therapeutics.
Reena R Lokare- Jyoti Wadmare- Sunita Patil- G. Wadmare- Darshan Patil,Transparent precision: Explainable AI empowered breast cancer recommendations for personalized treatment,Breast cancer is a prevalent form of cancer worldwide- and the current standard screening method- mammography- often requires invasive biopsy procedures for further assessment. Recent research has explored microRNAs (miRNAs) in circulating blood as potential biomarkers for early breast cancer diagnosis. In this study- we employed a multi-modal spectroscopy approach- combining attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) to comprehensively characterize the full-spectrum fingerprints of RNA biomarkers in the blood serum of breast cancer patients. The sensitivity of conventional FTIR and Raman spectroscopy was enhanced by ATR-FTIR and SERS through the utilization of a diamond ATR crystal and silver-coated silicon nanopillars- respectively. Moreover- a wider measurement wavelength range was achieved with the multi-modal approach than with a single spectroscopic method alone. We have shown the results on 91 clinical samples- which comprised 44 malignant and 47 benign cases. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on the ATR-FTIR- SERS- and multi-modal data. From the peak analysis- we gained insights into biomolecular absorption and scattering-related features- which aid in the differentiation of malignant and benign samples. Applying 32 machine learning algorithms to the PCA results- we identified key molecular fingerprints and demonstrated that the multi-modal approach outperforms individual techniques- achieving higher average validation accuracy (95.1%)- blind test accuracy (91.6%)- specificity (94.7%)- sensitivity (95.5%)- and F-score (94.8%). The support vector machine (SVM) model showed the best area under the curve (AUC) characterization value of 0.9979- indicating excellent performance. These findings highlight the potential of the multi-modal spectroscopy approach as an accurate- reliable- and rapid method for distinguishing between malignant and benign breast tumors in women. Such a label-free approach holds promise for improving early breast cancer diagnosis and patient outcomes.
A. Tien- M. Sadar,Treatments Targeting the Androgen Receptor and Its Splice Variants in Breast Cancer,Cytological evaluation through microscopic image analysis of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is pivotal in the initial screening of breast cancer. The sensitivity of FNAC as a screening tool relies on both image quality and the pathologistâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s expertise. To enhance diagnostic accuracy and alleviate the pathologistâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s workload- a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system was developed. A comparative study was conducted- assessing twelve candidate pre-trained models. Utilizing a locally gathered FNAC image dataset- three superior models-MobileNet-V2- DenseNet-121- and Inception-V3-were selected based on their training- validation- and testing accuracies. Further- these models underwent evaluation in four transfer learning scenarios to enhance testing accuracy. While the outcomes were promising- they left room for improvement- motivating us to create a novel deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The newly proposed model exhibited robust performance with testing accuracy at 85%. Our research concludes that the most lightweight- high-accuracy model is the one we propose. Weâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢ve integrated it into our user-friendly Android App- â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´Breast Cancer Detection System-â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ in TensorFlow Lite format- with cloud database support- showcasing its effectiveness.

Between October 2018 and February 2024- 671 breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven LN metastasis who received NAC followed by axillary LN dissection were enrolled in this prospective- multicenter study. Preoperative ultrasound (US) images- including B-mode ultrasound (BUS) and shear wave elastography (SWE)- were obtained. The included patients were randomly divided at a ratio of 8:2 into a training set and an independent test set- with five-fold cross-validation applied to training set. We first identified clinicopathological characteristics and conventional US features significantly associated with the axillary LN response and developed corresponding prediction models. We then constructed deep learning radiomics (DLR) models based on BUS and SWE data. Models performances were compared- and a combination model was developed using significant clinicopathological data and interpreted US features with the SWE-based DLR model. Discrimination- calibration and clinical utility of this model were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve- calibration curve and decision curve- respectively. Axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved in 52.41% of patients. In the test cohort- the clinicopathologic model had an accuracy of 71.30%- while radiologists' diagnoses ranged from 64.26% to 71.11%- indicating limited to moderate predictive ability for the axillary response to NAC. The SWE-based DLR model- with an accuracy of 80.81%- significantly outperformed the BUS-based DLR model- which scored 59.57%. The combination DLR model boasted an accuracy of 88.70% and a false-negative rate of 8.82%. It demonstrated strong discriminatory ability (AUC- 0.95)- precise calibration (p value obtained by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test- 0.68)- and practical clinical utility (probability threshold- 2.5-97.5%). The combination SWE-based DLR model can predict the axillary status after NAC in patients with node-positive breast cancer- and thus- may inform clinical decision-making to help avoid unnecessary axillary LN dissection.
Ya-Yu Sun- Xiao-Tong Shi- Li-Long Xu,Ultrasound for breast cancer detection: A bibliometric analysis of global trends between 2004 and 2024,Breast cancer has been one of the main causes of death among women recently- and it has been the focus of attention of many specialists and researchers in the health field. Because of its seriousness and spread speed- breast cancer-resisting methods- early diagnosis- diagnosis- and treatment have been the points of research discussion. Many computers-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems have been proposed to reduce the load on physicians and increase the accuracy of breast tumor diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge- combining patient information- including medical history- breast density- age- and other factors- with mammogram features from both breasts in craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral oblique (MLO) views has not been previously investigated for breast tumor classification. In this paper- we investigated the effectiveness of using those inputs by comparing two combination approaches. The soft voting approach- produced from statistical information-based models (decision tree- random forest- K-nearest neighbor- Gaussian naive Bayes- gradient boosting- and MLP) and an image-based model (CNN)- achieved 90% accuracy. Additionally- concatenating statistical and image-based features in a deep learning model achieved 93% accuracy. We found that it produced promising results that would enhance the CAD systems. As a result- this study finds that using both sides of mammograms outperformed the result of using only the infected side. In addition- integrating the mammogram features with statistical information enhanced the accuracy of the tumor classification. Our findings- based on a novel dataset- incorporate both patient information and four-view mammogram images- covering multiple classes: normal- benign- and malignant.

However- human interpretation of mammograms is often prone to diagnostic errors. This study addresses the challenge of improving the accuracy of breast cancer detection by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Methods: We propose an extended ensemble deep learning model that integrates three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG16- DenseNet121- and InceptionV3. The model utilizes multi-scale feature extraction to enhance the detection of both benign and malignant masses in mammograms. This ensemble approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets: INbreast and CBIS-DDSM. Results: The proposed ensemble model achieved significant performance improvements. On the INbreast dataset- the ensemble model attained an accuracy of 90.1%- recall of 88.3%- and an F1-score of 89.1%. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset- the model reached 89.5% accuracy and 90.2% specificity. The ensemble method outperformed each individual CNN model- reducing both false positives and false negatives- thereby providing more reliable diagnostic results. Conclusions: The ensemble deep learning model demonstrated strong potential as a decision support tool for radiologists- offering more accurate and earlier detection of breast cancer. By leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple CNN architectures- this approach can improve clinical decision making and enhance the accessibility of high-quality breast cancer screening.
Alexander S Millar- John Arnn- Sam Himes- Julio C. Facelli,Uncertainty in Breast Cancer Risk Prediction: A Conformal Prediction Study of Race Stratification,Breast cancer (BC) is one of the most fatal forms of cancer- making it a significant contributor to mortality rates worldwide. Early detection and timely treatment of breast cancer are crucial in reducing its mortality rate. To ensure a healthy lifestyle- it is essential to develop systems that can accurately diagnose breast cancer. Recent advances in modern computing and information technologies have enabled significant progress in the early detection and prediction of diseases within healthcare systems. This study proposes a method for precise and automatic breast cancer prediction using deep-modified transfer learning-based Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The CNN architectures employed include ResNet50- MobileNetV2- DenseNet121- and Xception- which serve as feature extractors to capture the most relevant features of breast Ultrasound images (BUSI). These extracted features are then accurately classified as benign or malignant using various high-performance classifiers- including Support Vector Machine (SVM)- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)- XGBoost- and Softmax. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed deep modified DenseNet121 network with the Softmax classifier outperformed other models and existing techniques. This latter achieved remarkable performance metrics- including an accuracy of 95.34%- a precision of 90.90%- and an F1 score of 93.02%. These results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the accuracy of breast cancer prediction. The superior performance of the proposed method provides significant improvements in decision-making speed and reduces the time- effort- and laboratory resources required for healthcare services. Consequently- this method has the potential to significantly enhance early diagnosis and enable more tailored treatment plans- ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes and reducing the overall mortality rates associated with breast cancer.

Additionally- the absence of a large patch-level whole slide imaging (WSI) dataset of breast cancer with annotated cell types hinders the ability of artificial intelligence to evaluate cell density in breast cancer WSI. We first employed Lasso-Cox regression to build a breast cancer prognosis assessment model based on cell density in a population study. Pathology experts manually annotated a dataset containing over 70-000 patches and used transfer learning based on ResNet152 to develop an artificial intelligence model for identifying different cell types in these patches. The results showed that significant prognostic differences were observed among breast cancer patients stratified by cell density score (P = 0.0018)- with the cell density score identified as an independent prognostic factor for breast cancer patients (P < 0.05). In the validation cohort- the predictive performance for overall survival (OS) was satisfactory- with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.893 (OS) at 1-year- 0.823 (OS) at 3-year- and 0.861 (OS) at 5-year intervals. We trained a robust model based on ResNet152- achieving over 99% classification accuracy for different cell types in patches. These achievements offer new public resources and tools for personalized treatment and prognosis assessment.
Xin Yu- Yushuai Yu- Xiewei Huang- Zirong Jiang- Qing Wang- Xiaoqin Yu- Chuangui Song,Unraveling the causal links and novel molecular classification of Crohn's disease in breast Cancer: a two-sample mendelian randomization and transcriptome analysis with prognostic modeling,Breast cancer remains a major global health concern. This study aimed to develop a deep-learning-based artificial intelligence (AI) model that predicts the malignancy of mammographic lesions and reduces unnecessary biopsies in patients with breast cancer. In this retrospective study- we used deep-learning-based AI to predict whether lesions in mammographic images are malignant. The AI model learned the malignancy as well as margins and shapes of mass lesions through multi-label training- similar to the diagnostic process of a radiologist. We used the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography. This dataset includes annotations for mass lesions- and we developed an algorithm to determine the exact location of the lesions for accurate classification. A multi-label classification approach enabled the model to recognize malignancy and lesion attributes. Our multi-label classification model- trained on both lesion shape and margin- demonstrated superior performance compared with models trained solely on malignancy. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping analysis revealed that by considering the margin and shape- the model assigned higher importance to border areas and analyzed pixels more uniformly when classifying malignant lesions. This approach improved diagnostic accuracy- particularly in challenging cases- such as American College of Radiology Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System categories 3 and 4- where the breast density exceeded 50%. This study highlights the potential of AI in improving the diagnosis of breast cancer. By integrating advanced techniques and modern neural network designs- we developed an AI model with enhanced accuracy for mammographic image analysis.
Shiping Li- Yihao Lin- Guangyu Liu- Zhimin Shao- Yinlong Yang,Unveiling the potential of breast MRI: a game changer for BI-RADS 4A microcalcifications.,Breast cancer can progress silently in its early stages and frequently without noticeable symptoms. However- it poses a serious risk to women. It is imperative to recognize this potential health concern to mitigate it early. In the last few years- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have advanced significantly in their ability to classify images of breast cancer. Their capacity to automatically extract discriminant features from images has enhanced the performances and accuracy of image classification tasks. They outperform state-of-the-art techniques in this area. Furthermore- complicated models that were first learned for certain tasks can be easily adapted to complete new tasks by using transfer-learning approaches. However- deep learning-based categorization techniques could experience overfitting issues- particularly in cases where the dataset is small. The primary goal of this work is to investigate the performances of certain deep learning models to classify breast cancer images and to study the effects of data augmentation techniques- such as image rotation or displacement when utilizing a transfer learning approach. Using certain image datasets- the ResNet18- Resnet50- and VGG16 models demonstrated accuracy improvements- according to our experimental results.
Yudong Zhang- Deguang Kong- Juanjuan Li- Tao Yang- Feng Yao- Ge Yang,Using Segment-Level Attention to Guide Breast Ultrasound Video Classification,Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)- notably deep learning- have sparked widespread curiosity with bioinformatics- particularly the challenges presented by medical imaging. Itâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s been really helpful in enabling the Computer Aided Diagnosis CAD system to provide precise outcomes. Nonetheless- it is still a difficult task to identify breast cancer in mammography images. The purpose of this effort is to lower False Positive Rate FPR and False Negative Rate FNR and increase Matthewsâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s correlation coefficient MCC value. Two highly tailored object detection models- YOLOv5 and Mask R-CNN- are utilized to get the job done. YOLOv5 is able to detect the mass and determine whether it is benign or malignant. However- YOLOV5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s limited real estate necessitates certain tweaks to the original model in order to get the desired effects. Tumor borders and size are both identified by Mask RCNN as it traverses breast parenchyma in search of malignancies. Stages of cancer are based on the magnitude of the patientsâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢ tumours. This model employs YOLOv5+Mask RCNN and is trained on the INbreast- CBIS-DDSM- and BNS dataset. The proposed model is compared against the baseline version of YOLOv5 to determine how well it performs. The proposed method improves performance- with an FPR of 0.049%- a FNR of 0.029%- and a high MCC value of 92.02%. Based on the results of the studies- combining YOLOv5 with Mask RCNN improves accuracy by 0.06 percentage points compared to using either method alone. Furthermore- this effort may aid in determining the patientâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s prognosis and allowing clinicians to be more accurate and predictable in the diagnosing process at an early stage.
Ken Cheligeer- Guosong Wu- Alison Laws- May Lynn Quan- Andrea Li- Anne-Marie Brisson- Jason Xie- Yuan Xu,Validation of large language models for detecting pathologic complete response in breast cancer using population-based pathology reports,The early prediction of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) will aid in the development of personalized treatments for patients with breast cancer. This study investigated the value of longitudinal multimodal deep learning (DL) based on breast MR and ultrasound (US) in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after NAC. We retrospectively reviewed the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and/or US images of 448 patients enrolled from three centers and extracted DL features from the largest section of the breast tumour using ResNet50. T test- Pearson correlation analysis and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were used to select the most significant DL features for the pre-NAC and post-2nd-NAC MR and US DL models. The stacking model integrates different single-modality DL models and meaningful clinical data. The diagnostic performance of the models was evaluated. In all the patients- the pCR rate was 36.65%. There was no significant difference in diagnostic performance between the different single-modality DL models (DeLong test- pÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ >Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.05). The stacking model integrating the above four DL models with HER2 status yielded areas under the curves of 0.951-0.979- accuracies of 91.55%-92.65%- sensitivities of 90.63%-93.94%- and specificities of 89.47%-94.44% in the cohorts. Longitudinal multimodal DL can be useful in predicting pCR. The stacking model can be used as a new tool for the early noninvasive prediction of the response to NAC- as evidenced by its excellent performance- and therefore aid the development of personalized treatment strategies for patients with breast cancer.

This work introduces an innovative non-invasive breast cancer classification model designed to improve the identification of cancer metastases. While this study marks the initial exploration into predicting MBC- additional investigations are essential to validate the occurrence of MBC. Our approach combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs)- specifically the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) model- with the powerful capabilities of graph neural networks (GNNs) to predict MBC patients based on their histopathology reports. This paper introduces a BERT-GNN approach for metastatic breast cancer prediction (BG-MBC) that integrates graph information derived from the BERT model. In this model- nodes are constructed from patient medical records- while BERT embeddings are employed to vectorise representations of the words in histopathology reports- thereby capturing semantic information crucial for classification by employing three distinct approaches (namely univariate selection- extra trees classifier for feature importance- and Shapley values to identify the features that have the most significant impact). Identifying the most crucial 30 features out of 676 generated as embeddings during model training- our model further enhances its predictive capabilities. The BG-MBC model achieves outstanding accuracy- with a detection rate of 0.98 and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.98- in identifying MBC patients. This remarkable performance is credited to the model's utilisation of attention scores generated by the LLM from histopathology reports- effectively capturing pertinent features for classification.
Thippaluru Umamaheswari- Y Murali Mohan Babu,ViT-MAENB7: An innovative breast cancer diagnosis model from 3D mammograms using advanced segmentation and classification process,Microwave imaging presents several potential advantages including its non-ionising and harmless nature. This open- multicentric- interventional- prospective- non-randomised trial aims to validate MammoWave's artificial intelligence (AI)-based classification algorithm- leveraging microwave imaging- to achieve a sensitivity exceeding 75% and a specificity exceeding 90% in breast screening. 10â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢000 volunteers undergoing regular mammographic breast cancer screening will be recruited across 9 European centres and invited to participate in the clinical study- involving MammoWave testing on both breasts. MammoWave results will be checked against the reference standard- to be intended as the output of conventional breast examination path (with histological confirmation of cancer cases) with 2 years follow-up. Anonymised clinical and MammoWave's results- including microwave images- associated features and a label provided by the AI-based classification algorithm- will be collected and stored in a dedicated electronic case report form. The prospective study will involve a comparative analysis between the output of the conventional breast examination path (control intervention) and the labels provided by MammoWave's AI system (experimental intervention). These labels will categorise breasts into two groups: breast With Suspicious Finding- indicating the presence of a suspicious lesion or No Suspicious Finding- indicating the absence of a lesion or the presence of a low-suspicion lesion. This trial aims to provide evidence regarding the novel MammoWave's AI system for detecting breast cancer in asymptomatic populations during screening.

Breast cancer is a most common type of cancer in women and it a main cause of death for women. There are three categories for the malignant cells: Normal- Mild- and Severe. Early diagnosis of the malignant cells can prevent these deaths. Numerous techniques- including MRIs- mammograms- ultrasounds- and biopsies- are used to identify cancerous cells. Hematoxylin and eosin-stained breast cancer histology photos are difficult to diagnose- labor-intensive- and frequently cause pathologists to disagree. Recent advances in deep learning have made histological image processing possible with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Histology images of breast cancer are categorized into sub-classes based on general tissue structure and morphology- as well as the density- variabil- ity- and organize of the cells. These subclasses include benign- malignant- and normal. Using this information- extract features at the cell and tissue levels- respectively from histopathological images- in smaller and larger size patches. The dataset repository is where the input image was obtained. The image has to be pre- processed. The feature extraction must then be put into practice. The pre- processed image must then be segmented. The image must be divided. We are able to apply many neural network models- including VGG-19 and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The findings of the experiment indicate that the accuracy. The primary goal of our method is to identify or anticipate breast cancer based on the input image.
