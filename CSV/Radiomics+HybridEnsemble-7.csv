We aimed to develop a machine learning model utilizing optimal volumes of interest extracted from multisequence magnetic resonance images to predict lymphovascular invasion in patients with invasive breast cancer. This study comprised 191 patients postoperatively diagnosed with invasive breast cancer through multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging. Independent predictors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses- culminating in the construction of a clinical model. Radiomic features were extracted from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging images across various volume of interest scales (-2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- entire- +2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- +4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- and +6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm). Subsequently- various radiomic models were developed using machine learning model algorithms- including logistic regression- support vector machine- k-nearest neighbor- gradient boosting machine- classification and regression tree- and random forest. A hybrid model was then formulated- amalgamating optimal radiomic and clinical models. The area under the curve of the clinical model was 0.757. Among the radiomic models- the most efficient diagnosis was achieved by the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780. The hybrid model- integrating the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- and the clinical model surpassed the individual clinical and radiomics models- exhibiting a superior area under the curve of 0.864. Utilizing a hybrid approach integrating clinical data and multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics models based on the multiscale tumor region volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm) proved effective in determining lymphovascular invasion status in patients with invasive breast cancer. This innovative methodology may offer valuable insights for treatment planning and disease management.

Saad Alkentar- Abdulkareem Assalem,A Hybrid Multistage Deep Learning System for Breast Cancer Classification,The differentiation between benign and malignant breast tumors extends beyond morphological structures to encompass functional alterations within the nodules. The combination of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and radiomics unveils functional insights and intricate details that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This study aims to assess the efficacy of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics- focusing on the impact of peritumoral region size on radiomic model accuracy. From January 2022 to November 2023- data were collected from 358 patients with breast nodules- diagnosed via PA/US examination and classified as BI-RADS 3-5. The study used the largest lesion dimension in PA images to define the region of interest- expanded by 2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- and 8â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- for extracting radiomic features. Techniques from statistics and machine learning were applied for feature selection- and logistic regression classifiers were used to build radiomic models. These models integrated both intratumoral and peritumoral data- with logistic regressions identifying key predictive features. The developed nomogram- combining 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral data with intratumoral and clinical features- showed superior diagnostic performance- achieving an AUC of 0.950 in the training cohort and 0.899 in validation. This model outperformed those based solely on clinical features or other radiomic methods- with the 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral region proving most effective in identifying malignant nodules. This research demonstrates the significant potential of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics- especially the advantage of integrating 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral with intratumoral features. This approach not only surpasses models based on clinical data but also underscores the importance of comprehensive radiomic analysis in accurately characterizing breast nodules.
Guihai Pan- Zejun Pan- Wubiao Chen- Yongjun Wu- Xiaoqing Di- Fei Zhou- Yuting Liao,Integration of MRI radiomics and clinical data for preoperative prediction of vascular invasion in breast cancer: A deep learning approach,Medical imaging diagnosis increasingly relies on Machine Learning (ML) models. This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets- where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability- which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models- the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique- STEM- can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)- Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN)- and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.
Zhi-Hui Chen- Hai-Ling Zha- Qing Yao- Wen-Bo Zhang- Guang-Quan Zhou- Cui-Ying Li,Predicting Pathological Characteristics of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer from Ultrasound Images: a Deep Ensemble Approach,BACKGROUND. MRI radiomics has been explored for three-tiered classification of HER2 expression levels (i.e.- HER2-zero- HER2-low- or HER2-positive) in patients with breast cancer- although an understanding of how such models reach their predictions is lacking. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to develop and test multiparametric MRI radiomics machine learning models for differentiating three-tiered HER2 expression levels in patients with breast cancer- as well as to explain the contributions of model features through local and global interpretations with the use of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis. METHODS. This retrospective study included 737 patients (mean age- 54.1 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 10.6 [SD] years) with breast cancer from two centers (center 1 [n = 578] and center 2 [n = 159])- all of whom underwent multiparametric breast MRI and had HER2 expression determined after excisional biopsy. Analysis entailed two tasks: differentiating HER2-negative (i.e.- HER2-zero or HER2-low) tumors from HER2-positive tumors (task 1) and differentiating HER2-zero tumors from HER2-low tumors (task 2). For each task- patients from center 1 were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to a training set (task 1: n = 405; task 2: n = 284) or an internal test set (task 1: n = 173; task 2: n = 122); patients from center 2 formed an external test set (task 1: n = 159; task 2: n = 105). Radiomic features were extracted from early phase dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging- T2-weighted imaging- and DWI. For each task- a support vector machine (SVM) was used for feature selection- a multiparametric radiomics score (radscore) was computed using feature weights from SVM correlation coefficients- conventional MRI and combined models were constructed- and model performances were evaluated. SHAP analysis was used to provide local and global interpretations of the model outputs. RESULTS. In the external test set- for task 1- AUCs for the conventional MRI model- radscore- and the combined model were 0.624- 0.757- and 0.762- respectively; for task 2- the AUC for radscore was 0.754- and no conventional MRI model or combined model could be constructed. SHAP analysis identified early phase DCE imaging features as having the strongest influence for both tasks; T2-weighted imaging features also had a prominent role for task 2. CONCLUSION. The findings indicate suboptimal performance of MRI radiomics models for noninvasive characterization of HER2 expression. CLINICAL IMPACT. The study provides an example of the use of SHAP interpretation analysis to better understand predictions of imaging-based machine learning models.

However- human interpretation of mammograms is often prone to diagnostic errors. This study addresses the challenge of improving the accuracy of breast cancer detection by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Methods: We propose an extended ensemble deep learning model that integrates three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG16- DenseNet121- and InceptionV3. The model utilizes multi-scale feature extraction to enhance the detection of both benign and malignant masses in mammograms. This ensemble approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets: INbreast and CBIS-DDSM. Results: The proposed ensemble model achieved significant performance improvements. On the INbreast dataset- the ensemble model attained an accuracy of 90.1%- recall of 88.3%- and an F1-score of 89.1%. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset- the model reached 89.5% accuracy and 90.2% specificity. The ensemble method outperformed each individual CNN model- reducing both false positives and false negatives- thereby providing more reliable diagnostic results. Conclusions: The ensemble deep learning model demonstrated strong potential as a decision support tool for radiologists- offering more accurate and earlier detection of breast cancer. By leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple CNN architectures- this approach can improve clinical decision making and enhance the accessibility of high-quality breast cancer screening.
