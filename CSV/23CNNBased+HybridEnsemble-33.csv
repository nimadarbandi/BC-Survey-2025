2022,Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification on Ultrasound Images,"Simple Summary In the literature, there exist plenty of research works focused on the detection and classification of breast cancer. However, only a few works have focused on the classification of breast cancer using ultrasound scan images. Although deep transfer learning models are useful in breast cancer classification, owing to their outstanding performance in a number of applications, image pre-processing and segmentation techniques are essential. In this context, the current study developed a new Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for the diagnosis and classification of breast cancer using ultrasound images. In the study, an optimal multi-level thresholding-based image segmentation technique was designed to identify the tumor-affected regions. The study also developed an ensemble of three deep learning models for feature extraction and an optimal machine learning classifier for breast cancer detection. The study offers a means of assisting radiologists and healthcare professionals in the breast cancer classification process. Abstract Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) provide an efficient way to diagnose the presence of diseases such as breast cancer using ultrasound images (USIs). Globally, breast cancer is one of the major causes of increased mortality rates among women. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD) models are widely employed in the detection and classification of tumors in USIs. The CAD systems are designed in such a way that they provide recommendations to help radiologists in diagnosing breast tumors and, furthermore, in disease prognosis. The accuracy of the classification process is decided by the quality of images and the radiologist’s experience. The design of Deep Learning (DL) models is found to be effective in the classification of breast cancer. In the current study, an Ensemble Deep-Learning-Enabled Clinical Decision Support System for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Classification (EDLCDS-BCDC) technique was developed using USIs. The proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique was intended to identify the existence of breast cancer using USIs. In this technique, USIs initially undergo pre-processing through two stages, namely wiener filtering and contrast enhancement. Furthermore, Chaotic Krill Herd Algorithm (CKHA) is applied with Kapur’s entropy (KE) for the image segmentation process. In addition, an ensemble of three deep learning models, VGG-16, VGG-19, and SqueezeNet, is used for feature extraction. Finally, Cat Swarm Optimization (CSO) with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model is utilized to classify the images based on whether breast cancer exists or not. A wide range of simulations were carried out on benchmark databases and the extensive results highlight the better outcomes of the proposed EDLCDS-BCDC technique over recent methods."
2022,Application of Transfer Learning and Ensemble Learning in Image-level Classification for Breast Histopathology,"Background: Breast cancer has the highest prevalence in women globally. The classification and diagnosis of breast cancer and its histopathological images have always been a hot spot of clinical concern. In Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), traditional classification models mostly use a single network to extract features, which has significant limitations. On the other hand, many networks are trained and optimized on patient-level datasets, ignoring the application of lower-level data labels. Method: This paper proposes a deep ensemble model based on image-level labels for the binary classification of benign and malignant lesions of breast histopathological images. First, the BreaKHis dataset is randomly divided into a training, validation and test set. Then, data augmentation techniques are used to balance the number of benign and malignant samples. Thirdly, considering the performance of transfer learning and the complementarity between each network, VGG16, Xception, ResNet50, DenseNet201 are selected as the base classifiers. Result: In the ensemble network model with accuracy as the weight, the image-level binary classification achieves an accuracy of $98.90\%$. In order to verify the capabilities of our method, the latest Transformer and Multilayer Perception (MLP) models have been experimentally compared on the same dataset. Our model wins with a $5\%-20\%$ advantage, emphasizing the ensemble model's far-reaching significance in classification tasks. Conclusion: This research focuses on improving the model's classification performance with an ensemble algorithm. Transfer learning plays an essential role in small datasets, improving training speed and accuracy. Our model has outperformed many existing approaches in accuracy, providing a method for the field of auxiliary medical diagnosis."
2022,Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography Images Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks and Fuzzy Ensemble Modeling Techniques,"Breast cancer has evolved as the most lethal illness impacting women all over the globe. Breast cancer may be detected early, which reduces mortality and increases the chances of a full recovery. Researchers all around the world are working on breast cancer screening tools based on medical imaging. Deep learning approaches have piqued the attention of many in the medical imaging field due to their rapid growth. In this research, mammography pictures were utilized to detect breast cancer. We have used four mammography imaging datasets with a similar number of 1145 normal, benign, and malignant pictures using various deep CNN (Inception V4, ResNet-164, VGG-11, and DenseNet121) models as base classifiers. The proposed technique employs an ensemble approach in which the Gompertz function is used to build fuzzy rankings of the base classification techniques, and the decision scores of the base models are adaptively combined to construct final predictions. The proposed fuzzy ensemble techniques outperform each individual transfer learning methodology as well as multiple advanced ensemble strategies (Weighted Average, Sugeno Integral) with reference to prediction and accuracy. The suggested Inception V4 ensemble model with fuzzy rank based Gompertz function has a 99.32% accuracy rate. We believe that the suggested approach will be of tremendous value to healthcare practitioners in identifying breast cancer patients early on, perhaps leading to an immediate diagnosis."
2023,"Breast Cancer Mass Classification Using Machine Learning, Binary-Coded Genetic Algorithms and an Ensemble of Deep Transfer Learning","Abstract: The diagnosis of breast cancer (BC) as early as possible is crucial for increasing the survival rate. Mammography enables finding the breast tissue changes years before they could develop into cancer symptoms. In this study, machine learning methods for BC mass pathology classification have been investigated using the radiologists’ mass annotations on the screen-film mammograms of the Breast Cancer Digital Repository (BCDR). The performances of precomputed features in the BCDR and discrete wavelet transform followed by Radon transform have been investigated by using four sequential feature selections and three genetic algorithms. Feature fusion from craniocaudal and mediolateral oblique views was shown to increase the performance of the classifier. Mass classification has been implemented by deep transfer learning (DTL) using the weights of ResNet50, NASNetLarge and Xception networks. An ensemble of DTL (EDTL) was shown to have higher classification performance than the DTL models. The proposed EDTL has area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) scores of 0.8843 and 0.9089 for mass classification on the region of interest (ROI) and ROI union datasets, respectively. The proposed EDTL has the highest BC mass classification AUC score on the BCDR to date and may be useful for other datasets."
2020,A New Deep Learning Model Selection Method for Colorectal Cancer Classification,"<p>Deep learning is one of the most commonly used techniques in computer-aided diagnosis systems.

2022,Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms for Skin Cancer Classification from Dermoscopic Images,"We carry out a critical assessment of machine learning and deep learning models for the classification of skin tumors. Machine learning (ML) algorithms tested in this work include logistic regression, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors classifier, decision tree classifier and Gaussian naive Bayes, while deep learning (DL) models employed are either based on a custom Convolutional Neural Network model, or leverage transfer learning via the use of pre-trained models (VGG16, Xception and ResNet50).

2019,Computer-aided diagnosis system for breast ultrasound images using deep learning,"The purpose of this study was to develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system for the classification of malignant and benign masses in the breast using ultrasonography based on a convolutional neural network (CNN), a state-of-the-art deep learning technique. We explored the regions for the correct classification by generating a heat map that presented the important regions used by the CNN for human malignancy/benign classification. Clinical data was obtained from a large-scale clinical trial previously conducted by the Japan Association of Breast and Thyroid Sonology. Images of 1536 breast masses (897 malignant and 639 benign) confirmed by pathological examinations were collected, with each breast mass captured from various angles using an ultrasound (US) imaging probe. We constructed an ensemble network by combining two CNN models (VGG19 and ResNet152) fine-tuned on balanced training data with augmentation and used the mass-level classification method to enable the CNN to classify a given mass using all views. For an independent test set consisting of 154 masses (77 malignant and 77 benign), our network showed outstanding classification performance with a sensitivity of 90.9% (95% confidence interval 84.5–97.3), a specificity of 87.0% (79.5–94.5), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.951 (0.916–0.987) compared to that of the two CNN models. In addition, our study indicated that the breast masses themselves were not detected by the CNN as important regions for correct mass classification. Collectively, this CNN-based CAD system is expected to assist doctors by improving the diagnosis of breast cancer in clinical practice."

2020,Breast Cancer Image Classification via Multi-Network Features and Dual-Network Orthogonal Low-Rank Learning,"Histopathological image analysis is an important technique for early diagnosis and detection of breast cancer in clinical practice. However, it has limited efficiency and thus the detection of breast cancer is still an open issue in medical image analysis. To improve the early diagnostic accuracy of breast cancer and reduce the workload of doctors, we devise a classification framework based on histology images by combining deep learning with machine learning methodologies in this paper. Specifically, we devise a multi-network feature extraction model by using pre-trained deep convolution neural networks (DCNNs), develop an effective feature dimension reduction method and train an ensemble support vector machine (E-SVM). First, we preprocess the histological images via scale transformation and color enhancement methods. Second, the multi-network features are extracted by using four pre-trained DCNNs (e.g., DenseNet-121, ResNet-50, multi-level InceptionV3, and multi-level VGG-16). Third, a feature selection method via dual-network orthogonal low-rank learning (DOLL) is further developed for performance boosting and overfitting alleviation. Finally, an E-SVM is trained via fused features and voting strategy to perform the classification task, which classifies the images into four classes (i.e., benign, in situ carcinomas, invasive carcinomas, and normal). We evaluate the proposed method on the public ICIAR 2018 Challenge dataset of histology images of breast cancer and achieve a high classification accuracy of 97.70%. Experimental results show that our method can achieve quite promising performance and outperform state-of-the-art methods."
2021,MCUa: Multi-Level Context and Uncertainty Aware Dynamic Deep Ensemble for Breast Cancer Histology Image Classification,"Breast histology image classification is a crucial step in the early diagnosis of breast cancer. In breast pathological diagnosis, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have demonstrated great success using digitized histology slides. However, tissue classification is still challenging due to the high visual variability of the large-sized digitized samples and the lack of contextual information. In this paper, we propose a novel CNN, called Multi-level Context and Uncertainty aware (MCUa) dynamic deep learning ensemble model. MCUa model consists of several multi-level context-aware models to learn the spatial dependency between image patches in a layer-wise fashion. It exploits the high sensitivity to the multi-level contextual information using an uncertainty quantification component to accomplish a novel dynamic ensemble model. MCUa model has achieved a high accuracy of 98.11% on a breast cancer histology image dataset. Experimental results show the superior effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to the state-of-the-art histology classification models."

2023,Optimal Trained Deep Learning Model for Breast Cancer Segmentation and Classification,"Breast cancer is the most widespread cancer among women. Based on the International cancer research center analysis, the highest number of deaths among women is due to breast cancer. Hence, detecting breast cancer at the earliest may help the oncologist to make appropriate decisions. Due to variations in breast tissue density, there is still a challenge in precise diagnosis and classification. To overcome this challenge, a novel OTDEM-based breast cancer segmentation and classification is proposed with the following four stages: they are, preprocessing, segmentation, feature extraction and classification. The input image is passed to the initial stage using the CLAHE filter to enhance the image. Then the preprocessed image is given to the segmentation stage for the image sub-segments by correlation-based deep joint segmentation. Following that, the features such as statistical features, improved LGXP, texton features, and shape-based features are derived from the segmented image. Then the derived features are fed to the ensemble model that includes CNN, DBN, and BI-GRU classifier to finalize the classification outcome. Further, to enhance the performance of the ensemble model, the weight of BI-GRU is optimized via a new algorithm termed SIPOA. This ensures optimal training to make the model more appropriate in its classification process. Finally, the performance of the proposed work is validated over the traditional models concerning different performance measures."

2022,Deep Learning and Machine Learning with Grid Search to Predict Later Occurrence of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Clinical Data,"Background: It is important to be able to predict, for each individual patient, the likelihood of later metastatic occurrence, because the prediction can guide treatment plans tailored to a specific patient to prevent metastasis and to help avoid under-treatment or over-treatment. Deep neural network (DNN) learning, commonly referred to as deep learning, has become popular due to its success in image detection and prediction, but questions such as whether deep learning outperforms other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data remain unanswered. Grid search has been introduced to deep learning hyperparameter tuning for the purpose of improving its prediction performance, but the effect of grid search on other machine learning methods are under-studied. In this research, we take the empirical approach to study the performance of deep learning and other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis (BCM) 5, 10, or 15 years after the initial treatment. We developed prediction models using the deep feedforward neural network (DFNN) methods, as well as models using nine other machine learning methods, including naïve Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), LASSO, decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), and XGBoost (XGB). We used grid search to tune hyperparameters for all methods. We then compared our feedforward deep learning models to the models trained using the nine other machine learning methods. Results: Based on the mean test AUC (Area under the ROC Curve) results, DFNN ranks 6th, 4th, and 3rd when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM, respectively, out of 10 methods. The top performing methods in predicting 5-year BCM are XGB (1st), RF (2nd), and KNN (3rd). For predicting 10-year BCM, the top performers are XGB (1st), RF (2nd), and NB (3rd). Finally, for 15-year BCM, the top performers are SVM (1st), LR and LASSO (tied for 2nd), and DFNN (3rd). The ensemble methods RF and XGB outperform other methods when data are less balanced, while SVM, LR, LASSO, and DFNN outperform other methods when data are more balanced. Our statistical testing results show that at a significance level of 0.05, DFNN overall performs comparably to other machine learning methods when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM. Conclusions: Our results show that deep learning with grid search overall performs at least as well as other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data. It is interesting to note that some of the other machine learning methods, such as XGB, RF, and SVM, are very strong competitors of DFNN when incorporating grid search. It is also worth noting that the computation time required to do grid search with DFNN is much more than that required to do grid search with the other nine machine learning methods."
2022,Machine learning and deep learning for breast cancer risk prediction and diagnosis: a Survey,"Breast cancer is the widest spreading disease among women globally. The prevalence rate of breast cancer continued to rise in the last few decades. The mitotic count is a relevant factor for grading invasive breast cancer. Early analysis is an extremely imperative step in treatment. However, it is not an easy one due to several skepticisms in detection which employ mammograms. Since it is subject to human prone error, requires more time for completion and the nuclei look similar during all stages of mitosis, automatic detection of mitosis is a good solution to overcome these problems. Detailed analysis of breast cancer normally requires medical images of different methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the diagnosis largely depend on the experiences of the radiologists, and uncertain diagnosis is quite frequent because of resolution limitations and the concerns of lawsuits arisen from wrong diagnosis or undetected lesions. In this paper, the top methodologies used for mitosis detection are analyzed. There are many algorithms for classification and prediction of breast cancer: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (CART), k Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Bayesian Networks (BN). The Wisconsin data set was used to analyze breast cancer as a training set to assess and measure the performance of the three ML classifiers in terms of key frameworks such as accuracy, recall, precision, and ROC. The outcome obtained in this paper provides a critique of the stateofart ML techniques for breast cancer detection. It was also found that the ensemble classifier gives better performance. A preliminary experiment conducted on cascaded RF and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) results in better accuracy than individual classifiers. The paper shows how we can use deep learning technology diagnosis of breast cancer using MIAS Dataset. A deep learning approach is almost used for immense task objective Image processing, Computer Vision, Medical Diagnosis, and Neural Language Processing."
2022,Improving Clinical Prediction of Later Occurrence of Breast Cancer Metastasis Using Deep Learning and Machine Learning with Grid Search,"ABSTRACT Background It is important to be able to predict, for each individual patient, the likelihood of later metastatic occurrence, because the prediction can guide treatment plans tailored to a specific patient to prevent metastasis and to help avoid under- or over-treatment. Deep Neural Network (DNN) learning, commonly referred to as deep learning, has become popular due to its success in image detection and prediction, but questions such as whether deep learning outperforms other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data remain unanswered. Grid search has been introduced to deep learning hyperparameter tunning for the purpose of improving its prediction performance, but the effect of grid search on other machine learning methods are under-studied. In this research, we take the empirical approach to study the performance of deep learning and other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data to predict the occurrence of breast cancer metastasis (BCM) 5, 10, or 15-years after the initial treatment. We developed DNN models as well as models using 9 other machine learning methods including Naive Bayes (NB), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), LASSO, Decision Tree (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forrest (RF), AdaBoost (ADB), and XGBoost (XGB). We used grid search to tune hyperparameters for all methods. We then compared the deep learning models to the models trained using the 9 other machine learning methods. Results Based on the mean test AUC results, DNN ranks 6th, 4th, and 3rd when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM respectively, out of 10 machine learning methods. The top performing methods in predicting 5-year BCM are XGB(1st), RF(2nd), and KNN(3rd). For predicting 10-year BCM the top performers are XGB (1st), RF(2nd), and NB(3rd) . Finally, for 15-year BCM the top performers are SVM (1st), LR and LASSO (tied for 2nd), and DNN (3rd). The ensemble methods RF and XGB outperform other methods when data are less balanced, while SVM, LR, LASSO, and DNN outperform other methods when data are more balanced. Our statistical testing results show that at a significance level of 0.05 DNN overall performs no worse than other machine learning methods when predicting 5-year, 10-year, and 15-year BCM. Conclusions Our results show that deep learning with grid search overall performs at least as well as other machine learning methods when using non-image clinical data. It is interesting to note that some of the other machine learning methods such as XGB, RF, and SVM are very strong competitors of DNN when incorporating grid search. It is also worth noting that the computation time required to do grid search with DNN is way more than that required to do grid search with the other 9 machine learning methods."

2022,Breast Cancer Early Detection Comparison with Deep Learning and Machine Learning Models: A Case of Study,"Breast cancer is one of the most widespread in the female population, being able to predict its developments and capturing the inputs of the onset of the disease is one of the main objectives that science is pursuing. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) in recent decades are extensively using these technological tools, such as Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL).

2022,Optimized Stacking Ensemble Learning Model for Breast Cancer Detection and Classification Using Machine Learning,"Breast cancer is the most frequently encountered medical hazard for women in their forties, affecting one in every eight women. It is the greatest cause of death worldwide, and early detection and diagnosis of the disease are extremely challenging. Breast cancer currently exceeds all other female cancers, including ovarian cancer. Researchers can use access to healthcare records to find previously unknown healthcare trends. According to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), breast cancer mortality rates can be lowered if the disease is detected early. The novelty of our work is to develop an optimized stacking ensemble learning (OSEL) model capable of early breast cancer prediction. A dataset from the University of California, Irvine repository was used, and comparisons to modern classifier models were undertaken. The implementation analyses reveal the unique approach’s efficacy and superiority when compared to existing contemporary categorization models (AdaBoostM1, gradient boosting, stochastic gradient boosting, CatBoost, and XGBoost). In every classification task, predictive models may be used to predict the class level, and the current research explores a range of predictive models. It is better to integrate multiple classification algorithms to generate a set of prediction models capable of predicting each class level with 91–99% accuracy. On the breast cancer Wisconsin dataset, the suggested OSEL model attained a maximum accuracy of 99.45%, much higher than any single classifier. Thus, the study helps healthcare professionals find breast cancer and prevent it from happening."
2023,Stacked ensemble deep learning for pancreas cancer classification using extreme gradient boosting,"Ensemble learning aims to improve prediction performance by combining several models or forecasts. However, how much and which ensemble learning techniques are useful in deep learning-based pipelines for pancreas computed tomography (CT) image classification is a challenge. Ensemble approaches are the most advanced solution to many machine learning problems. These techniques entail training multiple models and combining their predictions to improve the predictive performance of a single model. This article introduces the idea of Stacked Ensemble Deep Learning (SEDL), a pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. The weak learners are Inception V3, VGG16, and ResNet34, and we employed a stacking ensemble. By combining the first-level predictions, an input train set for XGBoost, the ensemble model at the second level of prediction, is created. Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), employed as a strong learner, will make the final classification. Our findings showed that SEDL performed better, with a 98.8% ensemble accuracy, after some adjustments to the hyperparameters. The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) public access dataset consists of 80 pancreas CT scans with a resolution of 512 * 512 pixels, from 53 male and 27 female subjects. A sample of two hundred and twenty-two images was used for training and testing data. We concluded that implementing the SEDL technique is an effective way to strengthen the robustness and increase the performance of the pipeline for classifying pancreas CT medical images. Interestingly, grouping like-minded or talented learners does not make a difference."
2020,Optimizing the Performance of Breast Cancer Classification by Employing the Same Domain Transfer Learning from Hybrid Deep Convolutional Neural Network Model,"Breast cancer is a significant factor in female mortality. An early cancer diagnosis leads to a reduction in the breast cancer death rate. With the help of a computer-aided diagnosis system, the efficiency increased, and the cost was reduced for the cancer diagnosis. Traditional breast cancer classification techniques are based on handcrafted features techniques, and their performance relies upon the chosen features. They also are very sensitive to different sizes and complex shapes. However, histopathological breast cancer images are very complex in shape. Currently, deep learning models have become an alternative solution for diagnosis, and have overcome the drawbacks of classical classification techniques. Although deep learning has performed well in various tasks of computer vision and pattern recognition, it still has some challenges. One of the main challenges is the lack of training data. To address this challenge and optimize the performance, we have utilized a transfer learning technique which is where the deep learning models train on a task, and then fine-tune the models for another task. We have employed transfer learning in two ways: Training our proposed model first on the same domain dataset, then on the target dataset, and training our model on a different domain dataset, then on the target dataset. We have empirically proven that the same domain transfer learning optimized the performance. Our hybrid model of parallel convolutional layers and residual links is utilized to classify hematoxylin–eosin-stained breast biopsy images into four classes: invasive carcinoma, in-situ carcinoma, benign tumor and normal tissue. To reduce the effect of overfitting, we have augmented the images with different image processing techniques. The proposed model achieved state-of-the-art performance, and it outperformed the latest methods by achieving a patch-wise classification accuracy of 90.5%, and an image-wise classification accuracy of 97.4% on the validation set. Moreover, we have achieved an image-wise classification accuracy of 96.1% on the test set of the microscopy ICIAR-2018 dataset."

2022,A New Hybrid Breast Cancer Diagnosis Model Using Deep Learning Model and ReliefF,"Breast cancer is a dangerous type of cancer usually found in women and is a significant research topic in medical science. In patients who are diagnosed and not treated early, cancer spreads to other organs, making treatment difficult. In breast cancer diagnosis, the accuracy of the pathological diagnosis is of great importance to shorten the decision-making process, minimize unnoticed cancer cells and obtain a faster diagnosis. However, the similarity of images in histopathological breast cancer image analysis is a sensitive and difficult process that requires high competence for field experts.

The model is based on a fine-tuned transfer-learning technique for fully connected layers. In addition, the models were compared to the k-nearest neighbor (kNN), naive Bayes (NB), and support vector machine (SVM) machine learning approaches. The performance of each feature extractor and classifier combination was analyzed using the sensitivity, precision, F1-Score, and ROC curves. The proposed hybrid model was trained separately at different magnifications using the BreakHis dataset. The results show that the model is an efficient classification model with up to 97.8% (AUC) accuracy."

2017,Hybrid Approach of Relation Network and Localized Graph Convolutional Filtering for Breast Cancer Subtype Classification,"Network biology has been successfully used to help reveal complex mechanisms of disease, especially cancer. On the other hand, network biology requires in-depth knowledge to construct disease-specific networks, but our current knowledge is very limited even with the recent advances in human cancer biology. Deep learning has shown an ability to address the problem like this. However, it conventionally used grid-like structured data, thus application of deep learning technologies to the human disease subtypes is yet to be explored. To overcome the issue, we propose a hybrid model, which integrates two key components 1) graph convolution neural network (graph CNN) and 2) relation network (RN). Experimental results on synthetic data and breast cancer data demonstrate that our proposed method shows better performances than existing methods."
2022,A Lightweight Hybrid Dilated Ghost Model-Based Approach for the Prognosis of Breast Cancer,"Most approaches use interactive priors to find tumours and then segment them based on tumour-centric candidates. A fully convolutional network is demonstrated for end-to-end breast tumour segmentation. When confronted with such a variety of options, to enhance tumour detection in digital mammograms, one uses multiscale picture information. Enhanced segmentation precision. The sampling of convolution layers are carefully chosen without adding parameters to prevent overfitting. The loss function is tuned to the tumor pixel fraction during training. Several studies have shown that the recommended method is effective. Tumour segmentation is automated for a variety of tumour sizes and forms postprocessing. Due to an increase in malignant cases, fundamental IoT malignant detection and family categorisation methodologies have been put to the test. In this paper, a novel malignant detection and family categorisation model based on the improved stochastic channel attention of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is presented. The lightweight deep learning model complies with tougher execution, training, and energy limits in practice. The improved stochastic channel attention and DenseNet models are employed to identify malignant cells, followed by family classification. On our datasets, the proposed model detects malignant cells with 99.3 percent accuracy and family categorisation with 98.5 percent accuracy. The model can detect and classify malignancy."
2022,Intelligent Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Breast Cancer Detection,"Breast cancer (BC) is a type of tumor that develops in the breast cells and is one of the most common cancers in women. Women are also at risk from BC, the second most life-threatening disease after lung cancer. The early diagnosis and classification of BC are very important. Furthermore, manual detection is time-consuming, laborious work, and, possibility of pathologist errors, and incorrect classification. To address the above highlighted issues, this paper presents a hybrid deep learning (CNN-GRU) model for the automatic detection of BC-IDC (+,−) using whole slide images (WSIs) of the well-known PCam Kaggle dataset.

2020,A Systematic Review of Breast Cancer Detection Using Thermography and Neural Networks,"Breast cancer plays a significant role in affecting female mortality. Researchers are actively seeking to develop early detection methods of breast cancer. Several technologies contributed to the reduction in mortality rate from this disease, but early detection contributes most to preventing disease spread, breast amputation and death. Thermography is a promising technology for early diagnosis where thermal cameras employed are of high resolution and sensitivity. The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with thermal images is an effective tool to detect early stage breast cancer and is foreseen to provide impressive predictability levels. This paper reviews systematically the related works employing thermography with AI highlighting their contributions and drawbacks and proposing open issues for research. Several different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and deep learning models were used in the literature to process thermographic images of breast cancer, such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Probability Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ResNet50, SeResNet50, V Net, Bayes Net, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional and DeConvolutional Neural Networks (C-DCNN), VGG-16, Hybrid (ResNet-50 and V-Net), ResNet101, DenseNet and InceptionV3. Previous studies were found limited to varying the numbers of thermal images used mostly from DMR-IR database. In addition, analysis of the literature indicate that several factors do affect the performance of the Neural Network used, such as Database, optimization method, Network model and extracted features. However, due to small sample size used, most of the studies achieved a classification accuracy of 80% to 100%."
2022,A Novel Hybrid Deep Learning Model for Metastatic Cancer Detection,"Cancer has been found as a heterogeneous disease with various subtypes and aims to destroy the body's normal cells abruptly. As a result, it is essential to detect and prognosis the distinct type of cancer since they may help cancer survivors with treatment in the early stage. It must also divide cancer patients into high- and low-risk groups. While realizing efficient detection of cancer is frequently a time-taking and exhausting task with the high possibility of pathologist errors and previous studies employed data mining and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify cancer, these strategies rely on handcrafted feature extraction techniques that result in incorrect classification. On the contrary, deep learning (DL) is robust in feature extraction and has recently been widely used for classification and detection purposes. This research implemented a novel hybrid AlexNet-gated recurrent unit (AlexNet-GRU) model for the lymph node (LN) breast cancer detection and classification. We have used a well-known Kaggle (PCam) data set to classify LN cancer samples. This study is tested and compared among three models: convolutional neural network GRU (CNN-GRU), CNN long short-term memory (CNN-LSTM), and the proposed AlexNet-GRU. The experimental results indicated that the performance metrics accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity (99.50%, 98.10%, 98.90%, and 97.50) of the proposed model can reduce the pathologist errors that occur during the diagnosis process of incorrect classification and significantly better performance than CNN-GRU and CNN-LSTM models. The proposed model is compared with other recent ML/DL algorithms to analyze the model's efficiency, which reveals that the proposed AlexNet-GRU model is computationally efficient. Also, the proposed model presents its superiority over state-of-the-art methods for LN breast cancer detection and classification."
2022,From machine learning to deep learning: experimental comparison of machine learning and deep learning for skin cancer image segmentation,"Skin lesion analysis is a tedious and challenging task, thus, in this research the suitability of employing machine learning or deep learning approaches for automatic lesion segmentation on dermoscopic skin cancer images is determined. The segmented region can assist clinical experts in understanding the complex lesion structure and internal pattern to find the correct skin cancer type for its early diagnosis and prevention. In this study, I present two methodologies for performing lesion segmentation: machine learning-based optimized K-means with Firefly Algorithm (FA) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). In the first model, the FA is hybridized with K-means clustering based on the novel average intensity fitness function to optimize the segmentation map. It is observed in the experimental results that the K-means algorithm may lead to poor results due to the wrong selection of initial centroid value, thus FA is hybridized into it to improve the performance. The second model is an enhanced encoder-decoder-based CNN framework implemented in an end-to-end fashion. These two models are compared to understand whether machine learning or deep learning is suitable to perform medical image segmentation based on a few performance metrics such as accuracy, Intersection over Union (IoU), and DICE index. These methods are evaluated and compared on two benchmark datasets provided by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) named ISIC 2016 [1] and ISIC 2017 [2]. Experimental results showed that the CNN model outperformed the machine learning model with an accuracy difference of 7.98% on ISIC 2016, and 7.32% on ISIC 2017. I concluded from the experimental findings that the deep learning model is more accurate and efficient in segmenting the lesion area as compared to the machine learning model. Thus, findings from this experimental work will be considered for the design of an automatic classification system by incorporating a deep learning-based segmentation approach as a pre-processing step. "
2023,ML‐DSTnet: A Novel Hybrid Model for Breast Cancer Diagnosis Improvement Based on Image Processing Using Machine Learning and Dempster–Shafer Theory,"Medical intelligence detection systems have changed with the help of artificial intelligence and have also faced challenges. Breast cancer diagnosis and classification are part of this medical intelligence system. Early detection can lead to an increase in treatment options. On the other hand, uncertainty is a case that has always been with the decision‐maker. The system’s parameters cannot be accurately estimated, and the wrong decision is made. To solve this problem, we have proposed a method in this article that reduces the ignorance of the problem with the help of Dempster–Shafer theory so that we can make a better decision. This research on the MIAS dataset, based on image processing machine learning and Dempster–Shafer mathematical theory, tries to improve the diagnosis and classification of benign, malignant masses. We first determine the results of the diagnosis of mass type with MLP by using the texture feature and CNN. We combine the results of the two classifications with Dempster–Shafer theory and improve its accuracy. The obtained results show that the proposed approach has better performance than others based on evaluation criteria such as accuracy of 99.10%, sensitivity of 98.4%, and specificity of 100%."

2022,A Hybrid Deep Learning Methodology for Breast Cancer Diagnosis using Magnetic Resonance Images,"Abstract: Today, breast cancer is one of the most common causes of cancer in women. Precise diagnosis of cancerous tissues based on images is essential in disease treatment before the disease progression. Although there are several image techniques for diagnosing, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contains extensive clinical information which usable with other image modalities such as mammography and ultrasound. In this study, the hybrid of an autoencoder network with ResNet architecture was proposed to significantly improve classification accuracy to diagnose breast cancer lesions into two categories: benign and malignant in MR images. Using the MR breast cancer images of the QIN-Breast database, the results present the employment of an autoencoder as a preprocessor can enhance the efficiency of CNN and ultimately lead to an accurate diagnosis of benign and malignant tissues by 97.65%. The proposed method significantly improved the classification from the point of view of speed, accuracy, and precision. This cancerous tissue classification was employed only using MR images without manual segmentation and feature extraction."
2023,Employing Atrous Pyramid Convolutional Deep Learning Approach for Detection to Diagnose Breast Cancer Tumors,"Breast cancer is among the most common diseases and one of the most common causes of death in the female population worldwide. Early identification of breast cancer improves survival. Therefore, radiologists will be able to make more accurate diagnoses if a computerized system is developed to detect breast cancer. Computer‐aided design techniques have the potential to help medical professionals to determine the specific location of breast tumors and better manage this disease more rapidly and accurately. MIAS datasets were used in this study. The aim of this study is to evaluate a noise reduction for mammographic pictures and to identify salt and pepper, Gaussian, and Poisson so that precise mass detection operations can be estimated. As a result, it provides a method for noise reduction known as quantum wavelet transform (QWT) filtering and an image morphology operator for precise mass segmentation in mammographic images by utilizing an Atrous pyramid convolutional neural network as the deep learning model for classification of mammographic images. The hybrid methodology dubbed QWT‐APCNN is compared to earlier methods in terms of peak signal‐to‐noise ratio (PSNR) and mean square error (MSE) in noise reduction and detection accuracy for mass area recognition. Compared to state‐of‐the‐art approaches, the proposed method performed better at noise reduction and segmentation according to different evaluation criteria such as an accuracy rate of 98.57%, 92% sensitivity, 88% specificity, 90% DSS, and ROC and AUC rate of 88.77."
2022,Federated Learning aided Breast Cancer Detection with Intelligent Heuristic-based Deep Learning Framework,"Abstract: Breast cancer is the second largest cause of female cancer death and one of the most hazardous diseases that leads to a higher mortality rate. Breast cancer is initialized with the malignant stage, where the abnormal growth of cancerous lumps is initiated from the breast cells. Periodic clinical checks and self-tests assist in early identification and thus progress the survival rates considerably. One of the eminent medical approaches is breast cancer recognition, which offers scientists and researchers huge complications. Breast cancer detection at an early stage permits the patients to receive suitable treatment, which increases the chances of survival. Thus, this paper utilizes a new form of artificial intelligence training called Federated Learning (FL), especially for breast cancer detection, the most eminent technique in the last few years. FL permits individual hospitals to benefit from the rich datasets of multiple non-affiliated hospitals without centralizing the data in one place. Hence, FL utilizes numerous collaborators for building a strong deep-learning model using a large dataset. In this paper, a hybridization of this type of training with a meta-heuristic and deep learning is aimed to be proposed for breast cancer diagnosis. This model encloses diverse steps that include (a) image collection, (b) feature extraction, and (c) classification phase. Initially, the mammogram images related to breast cancer are collected with the concept of FL from the affected individuals. The federated learning helps in reducing the processing time and ensures better performance of the proposed model. The obtained images are considered for the feature extraction phase. The Densenet architecture is used to extract the features used in the classification phase with the help of Enhanced Recurrent Neural Networks (E-RNN) for detecting breast cancer. Here, the performance is enhanced by tuning the certain parameter in the RNN network using a hybrid optimization algorithm called Hybrid Dragon-Rider Optimization (HDRO) with Dragonfly Algorithm (DA) and Red deer algorithm (RDA) to achieve accurate classification results. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the suggested breast cancer diagnosis model compared with conventional approaches using diverse quantitative measures."
2018,Early Detection of Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning Techniques,"Cancer is the second cause of death in the world. 8.8 million patients died due to cancer in 2015. Breast cancer is the leading cause of death among women. Several types of research have been done on early detection of breast cancer to start treatment and increase the chance of survival. Most of the studies concentrated on mammogram images. However, mammogram images sometimes have a risk of false detection that may endanger the patient’s health. It is vital to find alternative methods which are easier to implement and work with different data sets, cheaper and safer, that can produce a more reliable prediction. This paper proposes a hybrid model combined of several Machine Learning (ML) algorithms including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Decision Tree (DT) for effective breast cancer detection. This study also discusses the datasets used for breast cancer detection and diagnosis. The proposed model can be used with different data types such as image, blood, etc."
2020,A Systematic Review of Breast Cancer Detection Using Thermography and Neural Networks,"Breast cancer plays a significant role in affecting female mortality. Researchers are actively seeking to develop early detection methods of breast cancer. Several technologies contributed to the reduction in mortality rate from this disease, but early detection contributes most to preventing disease spread, breast amputation and death. Thermography is a promising technology for early diagnosis where thermal cameras employed are of high resolution and sensitivity. The combination of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with thermal images is an effective tool to detect early stage breast cancer and is foreseen to provide impressive predictability levels. This paper reviews systematically the related works employing thermography with AI highlighting their contributions and drawbacks and proposing open issues for research. Several different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and deep learning models were used in the literature to process thermographic images of breast cancer, such as Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Probability Neural Network (PNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), ResNet50, SeResNet50, V Net, Bayes Net, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional and DeConvolutional Neural Networks (C-DCNN), VGG-16, Hybrid (ResNet-50 and V-Net), ResNet101, DenseNet and InceptionV3. Previous studies were found limited to varying the numbers of thermal images used mostly from DMR-IR database. In addition, analysis of the literature indicate that several factors do affect the performance of the Neural Network used, such as Database, optimization method, Network model and extracted features. However, due to small sample size used, most of the studies achieved a classification accuracy of 80% to 100%."
