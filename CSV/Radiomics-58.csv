J Rui,Artificial Intelligence in Bioengineering: Improving the Diagnosis and Treatment of Breast Cancer,To develop a MRI-based radiomics model- integrating the intratumoral and peritumoral imaging information to predict axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in patients with breast cancer and to elucidate the model's decision-making process via interpretable algorithms. This study included 376 patients from three institutions who underwent contrast-enhanced breast MRI between 2021 and 2023. We used multiple machine learning algorithms to combine peritumoral- intratumoral- and radiological characteristics with the building of radiological- radiomics- and combined models. The model's performance was compared based on the area under the curve (AUC) obtained from the receiver operating characteristic analysis and interpretable machine learning techniques to analyze the operating mechanism of the model. The radiomics model- incorporating features from both intratumoral tissue and the 3Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral region and utilizing the backpropagation neural network (BPNN) algorithm- demonstrated superior diagnostic efficacy- achieving an AUC of 0.820. The AUC of the combination of the RAD score- clinical T stage- and spiculated margin was as high as 0.855. Furthermore- we conducted SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis to evaluate the contributions of RAD score- clinical T stage- and spiculated margin in ALNM status prediction. The interpretable radiomics model we propose can better predict the ALNM status of breast cancer and help inform clinical treatment decisions.

Two expert radiologists classified according to US BI-RADS criteria 352 FBLs detected in 352 patients (237 at Center A and 115 at Center B). An AI-based semi-automated segmentation was used to build a machine learning (ML) model on the basis of B-mode US of 237 images (center A) and then validated on an external cohort of B-mode US images of 115 patients (Center B). A total of 202 of 352 (57.4%) FBLs were benign- and 150 of 352 (42.6%) were malignant. The AI-based semi-automated segmentation achieved a success rate of 95.7% for one reviewer and 96% for the other- without significant difference (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.839). A total of 15 (4.3%) and 14 (4%) of 352 semi-automated segmentations were not accepted due to posterior acoustic shadowing at B-Mode US and 13 and 10 of them corresponded to malignant lesions- respectively. In the validation cohort- the characterization made by the expert radiologist yielded values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.933- 0.9- 0.857- 0.955- respectively. The ML model obtained values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.544- 0.6- 0.416- 0.628- respectively. The combined assessment of radiologists and ML model yielded values of sensitivity- specificity- PPV and NPV of 0.756- 0.928- 0.872- 0.855- respectively. AI-based semi-automated segmentation is feasible- allowing an instantaneous and reproducible extraction of US-derived radiomics features of FBLs. The combination of radiomics and US BI-RADS classification led to a potential decrease of unnecessary biopsy but at the expense of a not negligible increase of potentially missed cancers.
P Yan- W Gong- M Li- J Zhang- X Li- Y Jiang- H Luo- ...,TDF-Net: Trusted Dynamic Feature Fusion Network for breast cancer diagnosis using incomplete multimodal ultrasound,In patients with locally advanced breast cancer (LABC) receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC)- quantitative ultrasound (QUS) radiomics can predict final responses early within 4 of 16-18 weeks of treatment. The current study was planned to study the feasibility of a QUS-radiomics model-guided adaptive chemotherapy. The phase 2 open-label randomized controlled trial included patients with LABC planned for NAC. Patients were randomly allocated in 1:1 ratio to a standard arm or experimental arm stratified by hormonal receptor status. All patients were planned for standard anthracycline and taxane-based NAC as decided by their medical oncologist. Patients underwent QUS imaging using a clinical ultrasound device before the initiation of NAC and after the 1st and 4th weeks of treatment. A support vector machine-based radiomics model developed from an earlier cohort of patients was used to predict treatment response at the 4th week of NAC. In the standard arm- patients continued to receive planned chemotherapy with the treating oncologists blinded to results. In the experimental arm- the QUS-based prediction was conveyed to the responsible oncologist- and any changes to the planned chemotherapy for predicted non-responders were made by the responsible oncologist. All patients underwent surgery following NAC- and the final response was evaluated based on histopathological examination. Between June 2018 and July 2021- 60 patients were accrued in the study arm- with 28 patients in each arm available for final analysis. In patients without a change in chemotherapy regimen (53 of 56 patients total)- the QUS-radiomics model at week 4 of NAC that was used demonstrated an accuracy of 97%- respectively- in predicting the final treatment response. Seven patients were predicted to be non-responders (observational arm (n=2)- experimental arm (n=5)). Three of 5 non-responders in the experimental arm had chemotherapy regimens adapted with an early initiation of taxane therapy or chemotherapy intensification- or early surgery and ended up as responders on final evaluation. The study demonstrates the feasibility of QUS-radiomics adapted guided NAC for patients with breast cancer. The ability of a QUS-based model in the early prediction of treatment response was prospectively validated in the current study. clinicaltrials.gov- ID NCT04050228.

We aimed to develop a machine learning model utilizing optimal volumes of interest extracted from multisequence magnetic resonance images to predict lymphovascular invasion in patients with invasive breast cancer. This study comprised 191 patients postoperatively diagnosed with invasive breast cancer through multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging. Independent predictors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses- culminating in the construction of a clinical model. Radiomic features were extracted from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging images across various volume of interest scales (-2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- entire- +2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- +4Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm- and +6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm). Subsequently- various radiomic models were developed using machine learning model algorithms- including logistic regression- support vector machine- k-nearest neighbor- gradient boosting machine- classification and regression tree- and random forest. A hybrid model was then formulated- amalgamating optimal radiomic and clinical models. The area under the curve of the clinical model was 0.757. Among the radiomic models- the most efficient diagnosis was achieved by the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780. The hybrid model- integrating the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm)- and the clinical model surpassed the individual clinical and radiomics models- exhibiting a superior area under the curve of 0.864. Utilizing a hybrid approach integrating clinical data and multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics models based on the multiscale tumor region volume of interest (+2Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm) proved effective in determining lymphovascular invasion status in patients with invasive breast cancer. This innovative methodology may offer valuable insights for treatment planning and disease management.

The goal of this study was to design dosiomics-based machine learning (ML) models for prediction of AST- to enable creating optimized treatment plans for high-risk individuals. Dosiomics features extracted using Pyradiomics tool (v3.0.1)- along with treatment plan-derived dose volume histograms (DVHs)- and patient-specific treatment-related (PTR) data of breast cancer patients were used for modeling.

In total- seven unique combinations- along with seven classification algorithms- were considered after feature selection. The performance of each model was evaluated on the test group using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and f1-score. Accuracy- precision- and recall of each model were also studied.

This study confirmed the benefit of dosiomics-based ML in the prediction of AST. However- the combination of dosiomics- DVH- and PTR yields significant improvement in AST prediction. The results of this study provide the opportunity for timely interventions to prevent the occurrence of radiation induced AST.

The intratumoral volume of interest (VOI) and peritumoral VOI were delineated on primary breast cancers at three different DCE-MRI contrast phases: early- peak- and delayed. Radiomics features were extracted from each phase. After feature standardization- the training set was filtered by variance analysis- correlation analysis- and least absolute shrinkage and selection (LASSO). Using the extracted features- a logistic regression model based on each tumor subtype (Luminal A- Luminal B- HER2-enriched- triple-negative) was established. Ten models based on intratumoral or/plus peritumoral features from three different phases were developed for each differentiation. Radiomics features extracted from delayed phase DCE-MRI demonstrated dominant diagnostic performance over features from other phases. However- the differences were not statistically significant. In the full fusion model for differentiating different molecular subtypes- the most frequently screened features were those from the delayed phase. According to the Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) method- the most important features were also identified from the delayed phase. The intratumoral and peritumoral radiomics features from the delayed phase of DCE-MRI can provide additional information for preoperative molecular typing. The delayed phase of DCE-MRI cannot be ignored. Radiomics features extracted and radiomics models constructed from the delayed phase of DCE-MRI played a crucial role in molecular subtype classification- although no significant difference was observed in the test cohort. The molecular subtype of breast cancer provides a basis for setting treatment strategy and prognosis. The delayed-phase radiomics model outperformed that of early-/peak-phases- but no differently than other phases or combinations. Both intra- and peritumoral radiomics features offer valuable insights for molecular typing.

Reusing of publicly available datasets has the potential to fill this gap. Specifically in the domain of breast cancer- a large archive of publicly accessible medical images along with the corresponding clinical data is available at The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). However- existing datasets cannot be directly used as they are heterogeneous and cannot be effectively filtered for selecting specific image types required to develop AI models. This work focuses on the development of a homogenized dataset in the domain of breast cancer including clinical and imaging data. Five datasets were acquired from the TCIA and were harmonized. For the clinical data harmonization- a common data model was developed and a repeatable- documented ""extract-transform-load"" process was defined and executed for their homogenization. Further- Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine (DICOM) information was extracted from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and made accessible and searchable. The resulting harmonized dataset includes information about 2-035 subjects with breast cancer. Further- a platform named RV-Cherry-Picker enables search over both the clinical and diagnostic imaging datasets- providing unified access- facilitating the downloading of all study imaging that correspond to specific series' characteristics (e.g.- dynamic contrast-enhanced series)- and reducing the burden of acquiring the appropriate set of images for the respective AI model scenario. RV-Cherry-Picker provides access to the largest- publicly available- homogenized- imaging/clinical dataset for breast cancer to develop AI models on top.

Saad Alkentar- Abdulkareem Assalem,A Hybrid Multistage Deep Learning System for Breast Cancer Classification,The differentiation between benign and malignant breast tumors extends beyond morphological structures to encompass functional alterations within the nodules. The combination of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and radiomics unveils functional insights and intricate details that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This study aims to assess the efficacy of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics- focusing on the impact of peritumoral region size on radiomic model accuracy. From January 2022 to November 2023- data were collected from 358 patients with breast nodules- diagnosed via PA/US examination and classified as BI-RADS 3-5. The study used the largest lesion dimension in PA images to define the region of interest- expanded by 2â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- and 8â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm- for extracting radiomic features. Techniques from statistics and machine learning were applied for feature selection- and logistic regression classifiers were used to build radiomic models. These models integrated both intratumoral and peritumoral data- with logistic regressions identifying key predictive features. The developed nomogram- combining 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral data with intratumoral and clinical features- showed superior diagnostic performance- achieving an AUC of 0.950 in the training cohort and 0.899 in validation. This model outperformed those based solely on clinical features or other radiomic methods- with the 5â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤mm peritumoral region proving most effective in identifying malignant nodules.

We aim to automate BPE category from DCE-MRI. This study represents a secondary analysis of the Dense Tissue and Early Breast Neoplasm Screening trial. 4553 women with extremely dense breasts who received supplemental breast MRI screening in eight hospitals were included. Minimal- mild- moderate and marked BPE rated by radiologists were used as reference. Fifteen quantitative MRI features of the fibroglandular tissue were extracted to predict BPE using Random Forest- Naâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤ve Bayes- and KNN classifiers. Majority voting was used to combine the predictions. Internal-external validation was used for training and validation. The inverse-variance weighted mean accuracy was used to express mean performance across the eight hospitals. Cox regression was used to verify non inferiority of the association between automated rating and breast cancer occurrence compared to the association for manual rating. The accuracy of majority voting ranged between 0.56 and 0.84 across the eight hospitals. The weighted mean prediction accuracy for the four BPE categories was 0.76. The hazard ratio (HR) of BPE for breast cancer occurrence was comparable between automated rating and manual rating (HRÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 2.12 versus HRÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 1.97- PÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ =Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ 0.65 for mild/moderate/marked BPE relative to minimal BPE). It is feasible to rate BPE automatically in DCE-MRI of women with extremely dense breasts without compromising the underlying association between BPE and breast cancer occurrence. The accuracy for minimal BPE is superior to that for other BPE categories.

Understanding AI model decisions not only enhances trust but also aids in treatment strategies. However- the need for explainability must address privacy concerns- prompting the exploration of Federated Learning. This study explores the intersection of Explainable AI- Privacy- and Federated Learning in breast cancer diagnosis. Utilizing Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset and Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset- our results showcase that Federated Learning enhances user privacy while maintaining performance- achieving an accuracy of 97.59% and F1 score of 98.393% in Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer Dataset using artificial neural networks and 97.14% accuracy and 95.65% F1 score in Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset employing XGBoost. By computing SHAP values locally- we maintain explainability while enhancing privacy. Our findings highlight the potential of federated learning in maintaining privacy and explainability- advancing breast cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Following the injection of the contrast agent- dynamic scans were conducted across six phases- and delayed phase sagittal images were acquired using the VIBRANT sequence. Texture features were extracted from MRI images- and key radiomic and clinical features were selected using variance thresholding- correlation filtering- and logistic regression. A predictive model was developed combining these features- and its performance was evaluated through sensitivity- specificity- and area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The univariate models based on individual MRI sequences or clinical data demonstrated variable diagnostic performance. In contrast- the multifactorial model that combined radiomic features with clinical data achieved significantly higher accuracy- with an AUC of 0.829- sensitivity of 76.9â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤%- and specificity of 83.3â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšâ‰¤%.

Degan Hao- Dooman Arefan- M. Zuley- Wendie Berg- Shandong Wu,Adversarially Robust Feature Learning for Breast Cancer Diagnosis,OBJECTIVE To develop an artificial intelligence (AI) system for the early prediction of residual cancer burden (RCB) scores during neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA RCB III indicates drug resistance in breast cancer- and early detection methods are lacking. METHODS This study enrolled 1048 patients with breast cancer from four institutions- who were all receiving NAC. Magnetic resonance images were collected at the pre- and mid-NAC stages- and radiomics and deep learning features were extracted. A multitask AI system was developed to classify patients into three groups (RCB 0-I- II- and III ) in the primary cohort (PC- n=335). Feature selection was conducted using the Mann-Whitney U- test- Spearman analysis- least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression- and the Boruta algorithm. Single-modality models were developed followed by model integration. The AI system was validated in three external validation cohorts. (EVCs- n=713). RESULTS Among the patients- 442 (42.18%) were RCB 0-I- 462 (44.08%) were RCB II and 144 (13.74%) were RCB III. Model-I achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.975 in the PC and 0.923 in the EVCs for differentiating RCB III from RCB 0-II. Model-II distinguished RCB 0-I from RCB II-III- with an AUC of 0.976 in the PC and 0.910 in the EVCs. Subgroup analysis confirmed that the AI system was consistent across different clinical T stages and molecular subtypes. CONCLUSIONS The multitask AI system offers a noninvasive tool for the early prediction of RCB scores in breast cancer- supporting clinical decision-making during NAC.
Meena L C- Joe Prathap P M,An optimal deep learning approach for breast cancer detection and classification with pre-trained CNN-based feature learning mechanism,To explore the value of combined radiomics and deep learning models using different machine learning algorithms based on mammography (MG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in breast cancer (BC). The objective is to provide guidance for developing scientifically individualized treatment plans- assessing prognosis- and planning preoperative interventions. A retrospective analysis was conducted on clinical and imaging data from 270 patients with BC confirmed by surgical pathology at the Third Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between November 2022 and April 2024. Multiple sequence images from MG and MRI were selected- and regions of interest in the lesions were delineated. Radiomics and deep learning (3D-Resnet18) features were extracted and fused. The samples were randomly divided into training and test sets in a 7:3 ratio. Dimensionality reduction and feature selection were performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model- and other methods. Various machine learning algorithms were used to construct radiomics- deep learning- and combined models. These models were visualized and evaluated for performance using receiver operating characteristic curves- area under the curve (AUC)- calibration curves- and decision curves. The highest AUCs in the test set were achieved using radiomics-logistic regression (AUC = 0.759)- deep learning-multilayer perceptron (MLP) (AUC = 0.712)- and combined-MLP models (AUC = 0.846). The MLP model demonstrated strong classification performance- with the combined model (AUC = 0.846) outperforming both the radiomics (AUC = 0.756) and deep learning (AUC = 0.712) models. The multimodal radiomics and deep learning models developed in this study- incorporating various machine learning algorithms- offer significant value for the preoperative prediction of ALNM in BC.

This study aimed to develop machine learning (ML) models to analyze radiomic features from Automated Breast Volume Scanning (ABVS) images of different peritumoral region sizes to identify the optimal size for accurate preoperative Ki-67 prediction. A total of 668 breast cancer patients were enrolled and divided into training (486) and testing (182) cohorts. In the training cohort- ML models were developed for intratumoral and peritumoral regions (2- 4- 6- 8- and 10Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm). Relevant Ki-67 features for each ROI were identified- and different models were compared to determine the optimal one. These models were validated using a testing cohort to find the most accurate peritumoral region for Ki-67 prediction. SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) analysis was performed to identify key radiomic features from the optimal model. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model for the intratumoral region combined with the 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral region achieved the highest predictive accuracy- with an AUC of 0.957 in the training cohort and 0.920 in the testing cohort. Calibration curves confirmed reliability- and decision curve analysis demonstrated the highest net benefit. SHAP indicated that 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral radiomic features are more significant than intratumoral features. The XGBoost model using ABVS-derived radiomic features from both the intratumoral and 6Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ mm peritumoral regions provides the most accurate preoperative Ki-67 prediction.
Jose Manuel Valencia-Moreno- Jose Angel Gonzalez-Fraga- Everardo Gutierrez-Lopez- Vivian Estrada-Senti- Hugo Alexis Cantero-Ronquillo- Vitaly Kober,Breast cancer risk estimation with intelligent algorithms and risk factors for Cuban women,Breast cancer is the most prevalent form of cancer worldwide. Therefore- improved disease detection has emerged as a focal point in clinical studies. At the forefront of innovation- radiomics has the capability to extract comprehensive insights from medical images- ultimately enhancing the accuracy of diagnostic procedures. There has been rapid growth in the field of radiomics research on breast cancer in the past few years. We explored pertinent research articles in the Web of Science Core Collection database to gain a thorough understanding of breast cancer radiomics. We used CiteSpace to conduct a bibliometric analysis of the annual distribution of different nations- institutions- journals- authors- keywords- and references in the field of breast cancer radiomics. GraphPad Prism software was used to examine and graph yearly and country-specific trends and the proportions of publications. The tools utilized for the visualization of science mapping included CiteSpace and VOSviewer. Of the 891 publications- most were original articles (731- 91.09%) and a few were reviews (160- 8.91%). Most academic research has been published in China and the United States. The study centers predominantly consisted of major academic institutions- such as Fudan University and the Chinese Academy of Sciences- with some of their members being prominent figures in the field. Pinker- Katja has published the largest number of research papers. The majority of these studies have been published in medical journals focusing on radiology and oncology in recent years. In the realm of cutting-edge medical research- the top two keywords- magnetic resonance imaging and machine learning stand at the forefront as current areas of intense focus. Breast cancer radiomics is advancing rapidly- presenting numerous opportunities and obstacles. Our study of the literature in this academic area aimed to pinpoint the primary themes addressed in the studies and anticipate prospective avenues for research.
He Dou- Tian Gao- Zhaoting Li- Siyuan Jia- Danli Luo- Yuling Ba- Fucheng Li- Jianan Wang- Min Xiao,Comparison of clinical characteristics and pathologic complete response rate after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women under 35 years and older women with breast cancer,In the USA over 1 million breast biopsies are performed annually. Approximately 9.6% diagnostic exams were given Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢4A- most of which are 4A/4B. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) may improve biopsy outcome prediction for this subpopulation- but machine learning-based analysis of CEM is largely unexplored. We aim to develop a machine learning-based analysis of CEM using computer-extracted radiomics and radiologist-assessed descriptors to predict breast biopsy outcomes of BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions. This HIPPA-compliant- IRB-approved study included women in a single institution who had BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions and underwent CEM imaging prior to biopsy. Logistic regression models were built to predict biopsy outcomes using radiomics features and four radiologist-assessed qualitative descriptors. A cohort of 201 patients was used for model development/training- and an independent group of 86 patients were used as an internal test set. AUC was used to measure model's performance. Positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed on subgroups of BI-RADS 4A or 4B lesions. Model AUC was 0.90 for radiomics- 0.81 for clinical descriptors and 0.88 for their combination. On patients with an initial BI-RADS 4A or 4B scores- model combining radiomics and clinical descriptors of pre-biopsy CEM increased PPV3 to 18% from the radiologist's 6% for 4A patients- and to 25% from the radiologist's 17% for 4B patients. Machine learning models combining radiomics features and clinical descriptors on CEM can predict breast biopsy outcomes on women with BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions.
Youngran Kim- Cecilia Ganduglia-Cazaban- N. Tamirisa- A. Lucci- T. Krause,Contemporary Analysis of Reexcision and Conversion to Mastectomy Rates and Associated Healthcare Costs for Women Undergoing Breast-Conserving Surgery,We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted- and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression- independent clinical predictors- DL-Score- and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect- and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical- radiomics (Rad-Score)- and deep learning (DL-Score) models- the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895-0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838-0.973) in the validation set. Moreover- decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC- which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.

This study aimed to apply machine learning techniques to recognize the most important breast cancer risk factors. This case-control study included women aged 17-75 years who were referred to medical centers affiliated with Mashhad University of Medical Science between March 21- 2015- and March 19- 2016. The study had two datasets: one with 516 samples (258 cases and 258 controls) and another with 606 samples (303 cases and 303 controls). Written informed consent has been observed. Decision Tree (DT)- Random Forest (RF)- Logistic Regression (LR)- and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) were applied using R studio software. Regarding the DT and RF- the most important features that impact breast cancer were family cancer- individual history of breast cancer- biopsy sampling- rarely consumption of a dairy- fruit- and vegetable meal- while in PCA and LR these features including family cancer- pregnancy number- pregnancy tendency- abortion- first menstruation- the age of first childbirth and childbirth number. Machine learning algorithms can be used to extract the most important factors in the diagnosis of breast cancer in developing countries such as Iran.

In this study- the authors propose the use of radiomic technology and three-dimensional (3D) visualization technology to develop an unsupervised learning model for predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in patients with breast cancer (BC)- aiming to provide a new method for clinical axillary lymph node assessment in patients with this disease. In this study- we retrospectively analyzed the data of 350 patients with invasive BC who underwent lung-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and axillary lymph node dissection surgery at the Department of Breast Surgery of the Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. The authors used 3D visualization technology to create a 3D atlas of ALNs and identified the region of interest for the lymph nodes. Radiomic features were subsequently extracted and selected- and a prediction model for ALNs was constructed using the K-means unsupervised algorithm. To validate the model- the authors prospectively collected data from 128 BC patients who were clinically evaluated as negative at our center. Using 3D visualization technology- we extracted and selected a total of 36 CT radiomics features. The unsupervised learning model categorized 1737 unlabeled lymph nodes into two groups- and the analysis of the radiomic features between these groups indicated potential differences in lymph node status. Further validation with 1397 labeled lymph nodes demonstrated that the model had good predictive ability for axillary lymph node status- with an area under the curve of 0.847 (0.825-0.869). Additionally- the model's excellent predictive performance was confirmed in the 128 axillary clinical assessment negative cohort (cN0) and the 350 clinical assessment positive (cN+) cohort- for which the correct classification rates were 86.72 and 87.43%- respectively- which were significantly greater than those of clinical assessment methods. The authors created an unsupervised learning model that accurately predicts the status of ALNs. This approach offers a novel solution for the precise assessment of ALNs in patients with BC.
Chen Cheng- Yan Wang- Jine Zhao- Di Wu- Honge Li- Hongyan Zhao,Deep Learning and Radiomics in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer: Predicting Long-Term Prognosis and Clinical Outcomes,INTRODUCTION: Ultrasound in conjunction with mammography imaging- plays a vital role in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. However- speckle noise affects medical ultrasound images and degrades visual radiological interpretation. Speckle carries information about the interactions of the ultrasound pulse with the tissue microstructure- which generally causes several difficulties in identifying malignant and benign regions. The application of deep learning in image denoising has gained more attention in recent years. OBJECTIVES: The main objective of this work is to reduce speckle noise while preserving features and details in breast ultrasound images using GAN models. METHODS: We proposed two GANs models (Conditional GAN and Wasserstein GAN) for speckle-denoising public breast ultrasound databases: BUSI- DATASET A- AND UDIAT (DATASET B). The Conditional GAN model was trained using the Unet architecture- and the WGAN model was trained using the Resnet architecture. The image quality results in both algorithms were measured by Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR- 35â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®40 dB) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM- 0.90â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â®0.95) standard values. RESULTS: The experimental analysis clearly shows that the Conditional GAN model achieves better breast ultrasound despeckling performance over the datasets in terms of PSNR = 38.18 dB and SSIM = 0.96 with respect to the WGAN model (PSNR = 33.0068 dB and SSIM = 0.91) on the small ultrasound training datasets. CONCLUSIONS: The observed performance differences between CGAN and WGAN will help to better implement new tasks in a computer-aided detection/diagnosis (CAD) system. In future work- these data can be used as CAD input training for image classification- reducing overfitting and improving the performance and accuracy of deep convolutional algorithms.

It is an urgent demand to develop highly accurate- non-invasive methods for predicting ALN status. To evaluate the efficacy of ultrasound radiofrequency (URF) time-series parameters- in combination with clinical data- in predicting ALN metastasis in patients with breast cancer. We prospectively gathered clinicopathologic and ultrasonic data from patients diagnosed with breast cancer. Various machine-learning (ML) models were developed using all available features to determine the most efficient diagnostic model. Subsequently- distinct prediction models were created using the optimal ML model- and their diagnostic performances were evaluated and compared. The study encompassed 240 patients- of whom 88 had lymph node metastases. A leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) method was used to split the entire dataset into training and testing subsets. The random forest ML model outperformed the other algorithms- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92.

TNBC represents about 15% to 20% of all breast cancers and is aggressive and highly malignant. Currently- TNBC diagnosis primarily depends on pathological examination- while treatment efficacy is assessed through imaging- biomarker detection- pathological evaluation- and clinical symptom improvement. Among these- biomarker detection and pathological assessments are invasive- time-intensive procedures that may be difficult for patients with severe comorbidities and high complication risks. Thus- there is an urgent need for new- supportive tools in TNBC diagnosis and treatment. Deep learning and radiomics techniques represent advanced machine learning methodologies and are also emerging outcomes in the medical-engineering field in recent years. They are extensions of conventional imaging diagnostic methods and have demonstrated tremendous potential in image segmentation- reconstruction- recognition- and classification. These techniques hold certain application prospects for the diagnosis of TNBC- assessment of treatment response- and long-term prognosis prediction. This article reviews recent progress in the application of deep learning- ultrasound- MRI- and radiomics for TNBC diagnosis and treatment- based on research from both domestic and international scholars.

Our aim was to use machine learning methods to develop and validate an ultrasound-based radiomics nomogram for predicting HER2-low expression in BC. In this retrospective study- 222 patients (108 HER2-0 expression and 114 HER2-low expression) with BC were included. The enrolled patients were randomly divided into a training cohort and a test cohort with a ratio of 8:2. The tumor region of interest was manually delineated from ultrasound image- and radiomics features were subsequently extracted. The features underwent dimension reduction using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm- and rad-score were calculated. Five machine learning algorithms were applied for training- and the algorithm demonstrating the best performance was selected to construct a radiomics (USR) model. Clinical risk factors were integrated with rad-score to construct the prediction model- and a nomogram was plotted. The performance of the nomogram was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis. A total of 480 radiomics features were extracted- out of which 11 were screened out. The majority of the extracted features were wavelet features. Subsequently- the USR model was established- and rad-scores were computed. The nomogram- incorporating rad-score- tumor shape- border- and microcalcification- achieved the best performance in both the training cohort (AUC 0.89; 95%CI 0.836-0.936) and the test cohort (AUC 0.84; 95%CI 0.722-0.958)- outperforming both the USR model and clinical model. The calibration curves showed satisfactory consistency- and DCA confirmed the clinical utility of the nomogram. The nomogram model based on ultrasound radiomics exhibited high prediction value for HER2-low BC.

This retrospective study included 326 patients with pathologically proven breast cancer (TNBC: 129- non-TNBC: 197). The lesions were segmented using the ITK-SNAP software- and whole-volume radiomics features were extracted using a radiomics platform. Radiomics features were obtained from DCE-MRI and ADC maps. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression method was employed for feature selection. Three prediction models were constructed using a support vector machine classifier: Model A (based on the selected features of the ADC maps)- Model B (based on the selected features of DCE-MRI)- and Model C (based on the selected features of both combined). Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of the conventional MR image model and the 3 radiomics models in predicting TNBC. In the training dataset- the AUCs for the conventional MR image model and the 3 radiomics models were 0.749- 0.801- 0.847- and 0.896. The AUCs for the conventional MR image model and 3 radiomics models in the validation dataset were 0.693- 0.742- 0.793- and 0.876- respectively. Radiomics based on the combination of whole volume DCE-MRI and ADC maps is a promising tool for distinguishing between TNBC and non-TNBC.
Zhensheng Hu- Cong Lai- Hongze Liu- Jianping Man- Kai Chen- Qian Ouyang- Yi Zhou,Identification and validation of screening models for breast cancer with 3 serum miRNAs in an 11-349 samples mixed cohort,We investigate the predictive value of a comprehensive model based on preoperative ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features for pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) for the breast cancer. We enrolled 155 patients with pathologically confirmed breast cancer who underwent NAC. The patients were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set in the ratio of 7:3. The deep learning and radiomics features of pre-treatment ultrasound images were extracted- and the random forest recursive elimination algorithm and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used for feature screening and DL-Score and Rad-Score construction. According to multifactorial logistic regression- independent clinical predictors- DL-Score- and Rad-Score were selected to construct the comprehensive prediction model DLRC. The performance of the model was evaluated in terms of its predictive effect- and clinical practicability. Compared to the clinical- radiomics (Rad-Score)- and deep learning (DL-Score) models- the DLRC accurately predicted the pCR status- with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.937 (95%CI: 0.895-0.970) in the training set and 0.914 (95%CI: 0.838-0.973) in the validation set. Moreover- decision curve analysis confirmed that the DLRC had the highest clinical value among all models. The comprehensive model DLRC based on ultrasound radiomics- deep learning- and clinical features can effectively and accurately predict the pCR status of breast cancer after NAC- which is conducive to assisting clinical personalized diagnosis and treatment plan.
Sameet Sreenivasan- Chao Fang- Emuella M Flood- Natasha Markuzon- Jasmine Y Y Sze,Insights Into the Patient Experience of Hormone Therapy for Early Breast Cancer Treatment Using Patient Forum Discussions and Natural Language Processing,Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide. The therapy used and its success depend highly on the histology of the tumor. This study aimed to explore the potential of predicting the molecular subtype of breast cancer using radiomic features extracted from screening digital mammography (DM) images. A retrospective study was performed using the OPTIMAM Mammography Image Database (OMI-DB). Four binary classification tasks were performed: luminal A vs. non-luminal A- luminal B vs. non-luminal B- TNBC vs. non-TNBC- and HER2 vs. non-HER2. Feature selection was carried out by Pearson correlation and LASSO. The support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) ML classifiers were used- and their performance was evaluated with the accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). A total of 186 patients were included in the study: 58 luminal A- 35 luminal B- 52 TNBC- and 41 HER2. The SVM classifier resulted in AUCs during testing of 0.855 for luminal A- 0.812 for luminal B- 0.789 for TNBC- and 0.755 for HER2- respectively. The NB classifier showed AUCs during testing of 0.714 for luminal A- 0.746 for luminal B- 0.593 for TNBC- and 0.714 for HER2. The SVM classifier outperformed NB with statistical significance for luminal A (p = 0.0268) and TNBC (p = 0.0073). Our study showed the potential of radiomics for non-invasive breast cancer subtype classification.
Huiyan Ying- Weikaixin Kong- Xiangwei Xu,Integrated Network Pharmacology- Machine Learning and Experimental Validation to Identify the Key Targets and Compounds of TiaoShenGongJian for the Treatment of Breast Cancer,The primary objective of this paper is to develop a machine learning-based approach capable of predicting the treatment response of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) to enhance breast cancer treatment management. The proposed system aims to predict NAC outcomes across three categories: pathological complete response (CR)- partial response (PR)- and stable disease (SD)- by analyzing multimodal magnetic resonance images with clinical and molecular subtype markers. To ensure the comprehensiveness of our system design- texture radiomics were extracted from T1- T2- and STIR MRI modalities- along with functional radiomics from diffusion-weighted MRI at various b-values. The main rationale behind employing multiple b-values in collecting DW-MRI is to effectively capture the complexities of blood diffusion within the tumor microstructure. The proposed system comprises several key steps: (i) extracting texture and functional radiomics from T1- T2- STIR MRI- and DW-MRI data; (ii) identifying the most significant radiomics correlated with NAC treatment using a genetic algorithm; (iii) initially predicting the PR from alternative treatment responses utilizing the extracted textures and functional radiomics; and (iv) subsequently integrating clinical and molecular subtype markers with imaging radiomics to differentiate between CR and SD. Our proposed system is trained and validated through the utilization of a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation approach on various MRI scans from 109 subjects- of whom 27 had complete responses- 54 had partial responses- and 28 had no responses. The performance of the proposed system was assessed through the utilization of Cohenâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s Kappa and accuracy metrics- achieving 81.31% and 88.07%- respectively.

Guihai Pan- Zejun Pan- Wubiao Chen- Yongjun Wu- Xiaoqing Di- Fei Zhou- Yuting Liao,Integration of MRI radiomics and clinical data for preoperative prediction of vascular invasion in breast cancer: A deep learning approach,Medical imaging diagnosis increasingly relies on Machine Learning (ML) models. This is a task that is often hampered by severely imbalanced datasets- where positive cases can be quite rare. Their use is further compromised by their limited interpretability- which is becoming increasingly important. While post-hoc interpretability techniques such as SHAP and LIME have been used with some success on so-called black box models- the use of inherently understandable models makes such endeavors more fruitful. This paper addresses these issues by demonstrating how a relatively new synthetic data generation technique- STEM- can be used to produce data to train models produced by Grammatical Evolution (GE) that are inherently understandable. STEM is a recently introduced combination of the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)- Edited Nearest Neighbour (ENN)- and Mixup; it has previously been successfully used to tackle both between class and within class imbalance issues. We test our technique on the Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) and the Wisconsin Breast Cancer (WBC) datasets and compare Area Under the Curve (AUC) results with an ensemble of the top three performing classifiers from a set of eight standard ML classifiers with varying degrees of interpretability. We demonstrate that the GE-derived models present the best AUC while still maintaining interpretable solutions.

A total of 378 patients with invasive BC confirmed by pathological results were retrospectively enrolled in this study. Radiomics features were extracted guided by the BI-RADS lexicon from the regions of interest(ROIs) segmented with deep learning models. After features selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO) regression- four machine learning classifiers were used to establish the radiomics signature(Rad-score). Then- the integrated model was developed on the basis of the best Rad-score incorporating the independent clinical factors for TILs levels prediction. Tumors were segmented using the deep learning models with accuracy of 97.2%- sensitivity of 93.4%- specificity of 98.1%- and the posterior areas were also obtained. Eighteen morphology and texture related features were extracted from the ROIs and fourteen features were selected to construct the Rad-score models. Combined with independent clinical characteristics- the integrated model achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.889(95% CI-0.739-0.990) in the validation cohort and outperformed the traditional radiomics model with AUC of 0.756(0.649-0862) depended on hundreds of feature items. This study established a promising model for TILs levels prediction with numerable interpretable features and showed great potential to help decision-making and clinical applications. Imaging-based biomarkers has provides non-invasive ways for TILs levels evaluation in BC. Our model combining the BI-RADS guided radiomics features and clinical data outperformed the traditional radiomics approaches.
Amin Talebi- Ahmad Bitarafan-Rajabi- Azin Alizadeh-Asl- Parisa Seilani- Benyamin Khajetash- Ghasem Hajianfar- Meysam Tavakoli,Machine learning based radiomics model to predict radiotherapy induced cardiotoxicity in breast cancer,The survival rate of breast cancer for women in low- and middle-income countries is poor compared with that in high-income countries. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) combined with deep learning could potentially be a suitable solution enabling early detection of breast cancer. We aim to improve a classification network dedicated to classifying POCUS images by comparing different techniques for increasing the amount of training data. Two data sets consisting of breast tissue images were collected- one captured with POCUS and another with standard ultrasound (US). The data sets were expanded by using different techniques- including augmentation- histogram matching- histogram equalization- and cycle-consistent adversarial networks (CycleGANs). A classification network was trained on different combinations of the original and expanded data sets. Different types of augmentation were investigated and two different CycleGAN approaches were implemented. Almost all methods for expanding the data sets significantly improved the classification results compared with solely using POCUS images during the training of the classification network. When training the classification network on POCUS and CycleGAN-generated POCUS images- it was possible to achieve an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 95.3% (95% confidence interval 93.4% to 97.0%). Applying augmentation during training showed to be important and increased the performance of the classification network. Adding more data also increased the performance- but using standard US images or CycleGAN-generated POCUS images gave similar results.

To address this- we developed deep-learning models using post-NAC dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and clinical data. A total of 852 women with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive or triple-negative breast cancer were randomly divided into a training set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢724) and a validation set (nâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢128).

Xinyi Yang- Reshetov Iogr Vladmirovich- Poltavskaya Maria Georgievna- Agakina Yulia Sergeevna- Mingze He- Zitong Zeng- Yinpeng Qiang- Yu Cao- Kulikov Timur Sergeevich,Personalized chemotherapy selection for patients with triple-negative breast cancer using deep learning,The tumor burden within the axillary lymph nodes (ALNs) constitutes a pivotal factor in breast cancer- serving as the primary determinant for treatment decisions and exhibiting a close correlation with prognosis. This study aimed to investigate the potential of ultrasound-based radiomics and clinical characteristics in non-invasively distinguishing between low tumor burden (1-2 positive nodes) and high tumor burden (more than 2 positive nodes) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. A total of 215 patients with node-positive breast cancer- who underwent preoperative ultrasound examinations- were enrolled in this study. Among these patients- 144 cases were allocated to the training set- 37 cases to the validation set- and 34 cases to the testing set. Postoperative histopathology was used to determine the status of ALN tumor burden. The region of interest for breast cancer was delineated on the ultrasound image. Nine models were developed to predict high ALN tumor burden- employing a combination of three feature screening methods and three machine learning classifiers. Ultimately- the optimal model was selected and tested on both the validation and testing sets. In addition- clinical characteristics were screened to develop a clinical model. Furthermore- Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were utilized to provide explanations for the machine learning model. During the validation and testing sets- the models demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.577 to 0.733 and 0.583 to 0.719- and accuracies ranging from 64.9% to 75.7% and 64.7% to 70.6%- respectively. Ultimately- the Boruta_XGB model- comprising five radiomics features- was selected as the final model. The AUC values of this model for distinguishing low from high tumor burden were 0.828- 0.715- and 0.719 in the training- validation- and testing sets- respectively- demonstrating its superiority over the clinical model. The developed radiomics models exhibited a significant level of predictive performance. The Boruta_XGB radiomics model outperformed other radiomics models in this study.
Fuyu Guo- Shiwei Sun- Xiaoqian Deng- Yue Wang- Wei Yao- Peng Yue- Shaoduo Wu- Junrong Yan- Xiaojun Zhang- Yangang Zhang,Predicting axillary lymph node metastasis in breast cancer using a multimodal radiomics and deep learning model,Tryptophan catabolism is a central pathway in many cancers- serving to sustain an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The key enzymes involved in this tryptophan metabolism such as indoleamine 2-3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and tryptophan 2-3-dioxygenase (TDO) are reported as promising novel targets in cancer immunotherapy. IDO1 and TDO overexpression in TNBC cells promote resistance to cell death- proliferation- invasion- and metastasis. To date- there are no clinically available small-molecule inhibitors that target these enzymes. Navoximod- a reliable dual-specific inhibitor- resulted in poor bioavailability and modest efficacy in clinical trials restricts its utility. This situation urges the development of a potent drug-like candidate against these key enzymes. A total of 1574 natural compounds were proclaimed and subjected to ADME screening. Subsequently- the resultant compounds were attributed to hierarchical molecular docking and MM-GBSA validation. Ultimately- re-scoring with the aid of combined machine learning algorithms resulted six lead compounds. Captivatingly- NPACT00380 exhibited maximum interaction among the lead compounds. In addition- the scaffold analysis also highlighted that the chromanone moiety of the hit compound boasts anti-cancer activity against breast cancer cell lines. The reliability of the results was corroborated through a rigorous 100â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢ns molecular dynamics simulation using the parameters including RMSD- PCA and FEL analysis. In light of these findings- it is presumed that the proposed compound exhibits significant inhibitory activity. As a result- we speculate that further optimisation of NPACT00380 could be beneficial for the treatment and management of TNBC.
Zhi-Hui Chen- Hai-Ling Zha- Qing Yao- Wen-Bo Zhang- Guang-Quan Zhou- Cui-Ying Li,Predicting Pathological Characteristics of HER2-Positive Breast Cancer from Ultrasound Images: a Deep Ensemble Approach,BACKGROUND. MRI radiomics has been explored for three-tiered classification of HER2 expression levels (i.e.- HER2-zero- HER2-low- or HER2-positive) in patients with breast cancer- although an understanding of how such models reach their predictions is lacking. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to develop and test multiparametric MRI radiomics machine learning models for differentiating three-tiered HER2 expression levels in patients with breast cancer- as well as to explain the contributions of model features through local and global interpretations with the use of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis. METHODS. This retrospective study included 737 patients (mean age- 54.1 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Â± 10.6 [SD] years) with breast cancer from two centers (center 1 [n = 578] and center 2 [n = 159])- all of whom underwent multiparametric breast MRI and had HER2 expression determined after excisional biopsy. Analysis entailed two tasks: differentiating HER2-negative (i.e.- HER2-zero or HER2-low) tumors from HER2-positive tumors (task 1) and differentiating HER2-zero tumors from HER2-low tumors (task 2). For each task- patients from center 1 were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to a training set (task 1: n = 405; task 2: n = 284) or an internal test set (task 1: n = 173; task 2: n = 122); patients from center 2 formed an external test set (task 1: n = 159; task 2: n = 105). Radiomic features were extracted from early phase dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging- T2-weighted imaging- and DWI. For each task- a support vector machine (SVM) was used for feature selection- a multiparametric radiomics score (radscore) was computed using feature weights from SVM correlation coefficients- conventional MRI and combined models were constructed- and model performances were evaluated. SHAP analysis was used to provide local and global interpretations of the model outputs. RESULTS. In the external test set- for task 1- AUCs for the conventional MRI model- radscore- and the combined model were 0.624- 0.757- and 0.762- respectively; for task 2- the AUC for radscore was 0.754- and no conventional MRI model or combined model could be constructed. SHAP analysis identified early phase DCE imaging features as having the strongest influence for both tasks; T2-weighted imaging features also had a prominent role for task 2. CONCLUSION. The findings indicate suboptimal performance of MRI radiomics models for noninvasive characterization of HER2 expression. CLINICAL IMPACT. The study provides an example of the use of SHAP interpretation analysis to better understand predictions of imaging-based machine learning models.
Chunling Zhang- Peng Zhou- Ruobing Li- Zhongyuan Li- Aimei Ouyang,Prediction of lymphovascular invasion in invasive breast cancer based on clinical-MRI radiomics features,Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response prediction for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) patients is a challenging task clinically as it requires understanding complex histology interactions within the tumor microenvironment (TME). Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information- but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning- which typically analyze small- isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients- we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs- constructs a spatial TME graph- and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models- including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy- 96.0% sensitivity- 88.0% specificity- and an AUC of 0.82- through eight-fold cross-validation- outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response- thereby helping to prevent overtreatment- improve patient quality of life- reduce treatment cost- and enhance clinical outcomes- marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.
Peng Huang- Hui Yan- Jiawen Shang- Xin Xie,Prior information guided deep-learning model for tumor bed segmentation in breast cancer radiotherapy,Cardiotoxicity is one of the major concerns in breast cancer treatment- significantly affecting patient outcomes. To improve the likelihood of favorable outcomes for breast cancer survivors- it is essential to carefully balance the potential advantages of treatment methods with the risks of harm to healthy tissues- including the heart. There is currently a lack of comprehensive- data-driven evidence on effective risk stratification strategies. The aim of this study is to investigate the prediction of cardiotoxicity using machine learning methods combined with radiomics- clinical- and dosimetric features. A cohort of 83 left-sided breast cancer patients without a history of cardiac disease was examined. Two- and three-dimensional echocardiography were performed before and after 6 months of treatment to evaluate cardiotoxicity. Cardiac dose-volume histograms- demographic data- echocardiographic parameters- and ultrasound imaging radiomics features were collected for all patients. Toxicity modeling was developed with three feature selection methods and five classifiers in four separate groups (Dosimetric- DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Demographic- DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ DemographicÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Clinical- and DosimetricÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ DemographicÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ ClinicalÂ¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ +Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘â€šÃ„â€ Imaging). The prediction performance of the models was validated using five-fold cross-validation and evaluated by AUCs. 58% of patients showed cardiotoxicity 6 months after treatment.

Incorporating clinical and imaging features along with dose descriptors are beneficial for predicting cardiotoxicity after radiotherapy.
Jing Wang- Baizhou Li- Meng Luo- Jia Huang- Kun Zhang- Shu Zheng- Suzhan Zhang- Jiaojiao Zhou,Progression from ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive breast cancer: molecular features and clinical significance,This study aims to assess the diagnostic value of ultrasound habitat sub-region radiomics feature parameters using a fully connected neural networks (FCNN) combination method L2-1-norm in relation to breast cancer Ki-67 status. Ultrasound images from 528 cases of female breast cancer at the Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University and 232 cases of female breast cancer at the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of Xiangnan University were selected for this study. We utilized deep learning methods to automatically outline the gross tumor volume and perform habitat clustering. Subsequently- habitat sub-regions were extracted to identify radiomics features and underwent feature engineering using the L1-2-norm. A prediction model for the Ki-67 status of breast cancer patients was then developed using a FCNN. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy- area under the curve (AUC)- specificity (Spe)- positive predictive value (PPV)- negative predictive value (NPV)- Recall- and F1. In addition- calibration curves and clinical decision curves were plotted for the test set to visually assess the predictive accuracy and clinical benefit of the models. Based on the feature engineering using the L1-2-norm- a total of 9 core features were identified. The predictive model- constructed by the FCNN model based on these 9 features- achieved the following scores: ACC 0.856- AUC 0.915- Spe 0.843- PPV 0.920- NPV 0.747- Recall 0.974- and F1 0.890. Furthermore- calibration curves and clinical decision curves of the validation set demonstrated a high level of confidence in the model's performance and its clinical benefit. Habitat clustering of ultrasound images of breast cancer is effectively supported by the combined implementation of the L1-2-norm and FCNN algorithms- allowing for the accurate classification of the Ki-67 status in breast cancer patients.
Bin Hu- Yanjun Xu- Huiling Gong- Lang Tang- Hongchang Li,Radiomics Analysis of Intratumoral and Various Peritumoral Regions From Automated Breast Volume Scanning for Accurate Ki-67 Prediction in Breast Cancer Using Machine Learning,Breast cancer (BC) is a heterogeneous disease with various biological and clinical subtypes. HER2 status (human epidermal growth factor receptor 2) is a crucial biomarker- associated with aggressive tumor behavior and poor prognosis. Advanced algorithmic models can aid in predicting cancer growth and metastasis- serving as valuable clinical tools for classification and treatment. Effective treatment strategies in oncology rely on accurate decision-making and early identification of factors associated with positive outcomes. Breast cancer (BC) presents challenges in understanding its contributing factors and establishing precise diagnostic methods. Our research introduces a novel method utilizing machine learning (ML) techniques to explore the relationship between various clinical and molecular variables focusing on predicting the status of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)- a key aggressiveness biomarker in BC. This objective aligns with leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to support decision-making and address diagnostic considerations during treatment. Four ML models- namely logistic regression- random forest- LightGBM- and CatBoost- were implemented and evaluated using Python. The dataset was compiled by extracting medical records of BC patients- covering the period from 2018 to 2020. The model's predictive performance was evaluated using accuracy- precision- recall- and F1-score as performance metrics. The models achieved varying accuracies between 86.36 and 95.45%. The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of 90.90% while the random forest and LightGBM models achieved an accuracy of 86.36%. The CatBoost model outperformed others with a greater accuracy of 95.45%- indicating its superior predictive capabilities for HER2 status. The ML models demonstrated potential in predicting HER2 status- enabling early detection and facilitating personalized treatment strategies. Our findings emphasize the significance of AI and ML techniques in improving BC outcomes and guiding decision-making. Further research is required to explore the broader applications of ML in predicting comprehensive BC outcomes in diverse healthcare settings and among heterogeneous populations.
Faten Essam Hussain Aldoghachi- Amjad Oraibi- Noor Hamid Mohsen- Sara Salah Hassan,Repurposing Phytochemicals against Breast Cancer (MCF-7) using Classical Structure-Based Drug Design,Imaging features (radiomics) have potential for predicting Triple Negative Breast Cancer and other subtypes using magnetic resonance images (MRI). This work uses 244 images from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset to investigate the complex interplay between radiomics feature stability- with respect to segmentation variability- and prediction results of machine learning models. Our analysis reveals that features demonstrating high stability across different segmentations tend to enhance model performance- whereas unstable features sensitive to small segmentation changes degrade predictive accuracy. This exploration underscores the importance of feature stability in the development of reliable models for breast cancer subtype classification.
Yanfeng Li- Wengxing Long- Hongda Zhou- Tao Tan- Hui Xie,Revolutionizing breast cancer Ki-67 diagnosis: ultrasound radiomics and fully connected neural networks (FCNN) combination method,High breast density found using mammographs (MGs) reduces positivity rates and is considered a risk factor for breast cancer. Research on the relationship between Volpara density grade (VDG) and compressed breast thickness (CBT) in the Japanese population is still lacking. Moreover- little attention has been paid to pseudo-dense breasts with CBT < 30 mm among high-density breasts. We investigated VDG- CBT- and apparent high breast density in patients with breast cancer. Women who underwent MG and breast cancer surgery at our institution were included. VDG and CBT were measured. VDG was divided into a non-dense group (NDG) and a dense group (DG). This study included 419 patients. VDG was negatively correlated with CBT. The DG included younger patients with lower body mass index (BMI) and thinner CBT. In the DG- patients with CBT < 30 mm had lower BMI and higher VDG; however- no significant difference was noted in the positivity rate of the two groups. Younger women tend to have higher breast density- resulting in thinner CBT- which may pose challenges in detecting breast cancer on MGs. However- there was no significant difference in the breast cancer detection rate between CBT < 30 mm and CBT â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 30 mm.
Qingmei Huang- Xuqian Zong- Changrong Yuan- Meimei Shang- Rong Yan- Yeping Zheng- Meie Niu- Yang Yang- Fulei Wu,Risk factors for self-reported high symptom cluster burdens in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy in China: A cross-sectional study,To develop machine learning models based on preoperative dynamic enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) radiomics and to explore their potential prognostic value in the differential diagnosis of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-low from HER2-positive breast cancer (BC). A total of 233 patients with pathologically confirmed invasive breast cancer admitted to our hospital between January 2018 and December 2022 were included in this retrospective analysis. Of these- 103 cases were diagnosed as HER2-positive and 130 cases were HER2 low-expression BC. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique is employed to address the class imbalance problem. Patients were randomly split into a training set (163 cases) and a validation set (70 cases) in a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features from DCE-MRI second-phase imaging were extracted. Z-score normalization was used to standardize the radiomics features- and Pearson's correlation coefficient and recursive feature elimination were used to explore the significant features. Prediction models were constructed using 6 machine learning algorithms: logistic regression- random forest- support vector machine- AdaBoost- decision tree- and auto-encoder. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed- and predictive models were evaluated according to the area under the curve (AUC)- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity. In the training set- the AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity of all models were 1.000. However- in the validation set- the auto-encoder model's AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity were 0.994- 0.976- 0.972- and 0.978- respectively. The remaining models' AUC- accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity were 1.000. The DeLong test showed no statistically significant differences between the machine learning models in the training and validation sets (Zâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±0- Pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±=â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÂ±1). Our study investigated the feasibility of using DCE-MRI-based radiomics features to predict HER2-low BC. Certain radiomics features showed associations with HER2-low BC and may have predictive value. Machine learning prediction models developed using these radiomics features could be beneficial for distinguishing between HER2-low and HER2-positive BC. These noninvasive preoperative models have the potential to assist in clinical decision-making for HER2-low breast cancer- thereby advancing personalized clinical precision.
Sicheng Zhou- Anne Blaes- Chetan Shenoy- Ju Sun- Rui Zhang,Risk prediction of heart diseases in patients with breast cancer: A deep learning approach with longitudinal electronic health records data,Breast cancer is a common disease that causes great health concerns to women worldwide. During the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer- medical imaging plays an essential role- but its interpretation relies on radiologists or clinical doctors. Radiomics can extract high-throughput quantitative imaging features from images of various modalities via traditional machine learning or deep learning methods following a series of standard processes. Hopefully- radiomic models may aid various processes in clinical practice. In this review- we summarize the current utilization of radiomics for predicting clinicopathological indices and clinical outcomes. We also focus on radio-multi-omics studies that bridge the gap between phenotypic and microscopic scale information. Acknowledging the deficiencies that currently hinder the clinical adoption of radiomic models- we discuss the underlying causes of this situation and propose future directions for advancing radiomics in breast cancer research.
Muhammad Usman Tariq- Muhammad Afnan Siddiqui- Nasir Ud Din- Naila Kayani,Role of SOX10 Immunohistochemical Expression in Diagnosing Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Its Correlation With Clinicopathological Features,The objective of this study was to develop a deep learning-and-radiomics-based ultrasound nomogram for the evaluation of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastasis risk in breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years. The study enrolled breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years who underwent either sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection at Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. DenseNet-201 was employed as the base model- and it was trained using the Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function to extract deep learning (DL) features from ultrasound images. Additionally- radiomics features were extracted from ultrasound images utilizing the Pyradiomics tool- and a Rad-Score (RS) was calculated employing the Lasso regression algorithm. A stepwise multivariable logistic regression analysis was conducted in the training set to establish a prediction model for lymph node metastasis- which was subsequently validated in the validation set. Evaluation metrics included area under the curve (AUC)- accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- positive predictive value- negative predictive value- and F1-score. The calibration of the model's performance and its clinical prediction accuracy were assessed using calibration curves and decision curves respectively. Furthermore- integrated discrimination improvement and net reclassification improvement were utilized to quantify enhancements in RS. Histological grade- axillary ultrasound- and RS were identified as independent risk factors for predicting lymph node metastasis. The integration of the RS into the clinical prediction model significantly improved its predictive performance- with an AUC of 0.937 in the training set- surpassing both the clinical model and the RS model alone. In the validation set- the integrated model also outperformed other models with AUCs of 0.906- 0.744- and 0.890 for the integrated model- clinical model- and RS model respectively. Experimental results demonstrated that this study's integrated prediction model could enhance both accuracy and generalizability. The DL and radiomics-based model exhibited remarkable accuracy and reliability in predicting ALN status among breast cancer patients â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘Â¬Â¢ 75 years- thereby contributing to the enhancement of personalized treatment strategies' efficacy and improvement of patients' quality of life.
Matthias Hans Belau- Lisa Jung- Tabea Maurer- Nadia Obi- Sabine Behrens- Petra Seibold- Heiko Becher- Jenny Chang-Claude,Social relationships and their impact on health-related quality of life in a long-term breast cancer survivor cohort,Machine learning classifiers are increasingly used to create predictive models for pathological complete response (pCR) in breast cancer after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Few studies have compared the effectiveness of different ML classifiers. This study evaluated radiomics models based on pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1 weighted images (T1WI) in predicting breast cancer pCR after NAT and compared the performance of ML classifiers. This retrospective study enrolled 281 patients undergoing NAT from the Duke-Breast-Cancer-MRI dataset. Radiomic features were extracted from pre- and post-contrast first-phase T1WI images. The Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied- then the dataset was randomly divided into training and validation groups (7:3). The radiomics model was built using selected optimal features. Support vector machine (SVM)- random forest (RF)- decision tree (DT)- k-nearest neighbor (KNN)- extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)- and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) were classifiers. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess predictive performance. LightGBM performed best in predicting pCR [area under the curve (AUC): 0.823- 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.743-0.902]- accuracy 74.0%- sensitivity 85.0%- specificity 67.2%]. During subgroup analysis- RF was most effective in pCR prediction in luminal breast cancers (AUC: 0.914- 95% CI [0.847-0.981]- accuracy 87.0%- sensitivity 85.2%- specificity 88.1%). In triple-negative breast cancers- LightGBM performed best (AUC: 0.836- 95% CI [0.708-0.965]- accuracy 78.6%- sensitivity 68.2%- specificity 90.0%). The LightGBM-based radiomics model performed best in predicting pCR in patients with breast cancer. RF and LightGBM showed promising results for luminal and triple-negative breast cancers- respectively.
Mohit Agarwal- Amit Kumar Dwivedi- Dibyanarayan Hazra- Preeti Sharma- Suneet Kumar Gupta- Deepak Garg,The efficient classification of breast cancer on low-power IoT devices: A study on genetically evolved U-Net,"In the practical work of a radiologist or oncologist- especially in the context of individualized treatment- there is a need for fast and in-depth diagnostics. Radiomics and artificial intelligence can be of great help here. Quantitative and qualitative assessments obtained in this way act as decision support for the physician. The aim of the study is to enhance the ability of quantitative and qualitative assessment of metastatic spinal lesions in breast cancer- to better evaluate the nature of changes under the influence of therapy- in addition to MDA. We used MRI data in sagittal projection for a patient diagnosed with T2N3M1 breast cancer when treated according to accepted clinical protocols. Metastases to the spine were assessed by a radiologist and by machine analysis using the described software: image internal structure extraction operators and recognition based on traditional neural networks. Fragments of the program codes used are also given. The structure of metastatically changed vertebrae in sagittal projection was analysed using machine operators of image analysis. Subtle changes in structure such as several types of ""calderas"" and the pattern of change in image complexity as treatment with CDK 4/6 inhibitors were detected. Measurements were supported by metastasis recognition using neural networks- to increase the reliability of the estimates. In addition to the ability to record response to therapy- a fundamental ability to assess the degree of action compared to previous therapy was identified. The study showed high efficiency of using image structure analysis algorithms- good correlation of the results obtained with the radiologist's opinion and with clinical and laboratory data- and allowed to approach the analysis of subtle effects to obtain not only quantitative characteristics in addition to MDA- but also to obtain new qualitative results."
Wenjuan Gao- Qian Zhang- Dan Wang- Xiaoxu Li- Linping Zhang- Mengjiao Xu- Jing Han,The role expectations of young women as wives after breast cancer treatment: A qualitative study,The objective of this study is to develop a novel diagnostic tool using deep learning and radiomics to distinguish bone tumors on CT images as metastases from breast cancer. By providing a more accurate and reliable method for identifying metastatic bone tumors- this approach aims to significantly improve clinical decision-making and patient management in the context of breast cancer. This study utilized CT images of bone tumors from 178 patients- including 78 cases of breast cancer bone metastases and 100 cases of non-breast cancer bone metastases. The dataset was processed using the Medical Image Segmentation via Self-distilling TransUNet (MISSU) model for automated segmentation. Radiomics features were extracted from the segmented tumor regions using the Pyradiomics library- capturing various aspects of tumor phenotype. Feature selection was conducted using LASSO regression to identify the most predictive features. The model's performance was evaluated using ten-fold cross-validation- with metrics including accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- and the Dice similarity coefficient. The developed radiomics model using the SVM algorithm achieved high discriminatory power- with an AUC of 0.936 on the training set and 0.953 on the test set. The model's performance metrics demonstrated strong accuracy- sensitivity- and specificity. Specifically- the accuracy was 0.864 for the training set and 0.853 for the test set. Sensitivity values were 0.838 and 0.789 for the training and test sets- respectively- while specificity values were 0.896 and 0.933 for the training and test sets- respectively. These results indicate that the SVM model effectively distinguishes between bone metastases originating from breast cancer and other origins. Additionally- the average Dice similarity coefficient for the automated segmentation was 0.915- demonstrating a high level of agreement with manual segmentations. This study demonstrates the potential of combining CT-based radiomics and deep learning for the accurate detection of bone metastases from breast cancer. The high-performance metrics indicate that this approach can significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy- aiding in early detection and improving patient outcomes. Future research should focus on validating these findings on larger datasets- integrating the model into clinical workflows- and exploring its use in personalized treatment planning.

Golla Madhu- Avinash Meher Bonasi- Sandeep Kautish- Abdulaziz S Almazyad- Ali Wagdy Mohamed- Frank Werner- Mehdi Hosseinzadeh- Mohammad Shokouhifar,UCapsNet: A Two-Stage Deep Learning Model Using U-Net and Capsule Network for Breast Cancer Segmentation and Classification in Ultrasound Imaging,To develop a model for accurate prediction of axillary lymph node (LN) status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) in breast cancer patients with nodal involvement. Between October 2018 and February 2024- 671 breast cancer patients with biopsy-proven LN metastasis who received NAC followed by axillary LN dissection were enrolled in this prospective- multicenter study. Preoperative ultrasound (US) images- including B-mode ultrasound (BUS) and shear wave elastography (SWE)- were obtained. The included patients were randomly divided at a ratio of 8:2 into a training set and an independent test set- with five-fold cross-validation applied to training set. We first identified clinicopathological characteristics and conventional US features significantly associated with the axillary LN response and developed corresponding prediction models. We then constructed deep learning radiomics (DLR) models based on BUS and SWE data. Models performances were compared- and a combination model was developed using significant clinicopathological data and interpreted US features with the SWE-based DLR model. Discrimination- calibration and clinical utility of this model were analyzed using receiver operating characteristic curve- calibration curve and decision curve- respectively. Axillary pathologic complete response (pCR) was achieved in 52.41% of patients. In the test cohort- the clinicopathologic model had an accuracy of 71.30%- while radiologists' diagnoses ranged from 64.26% to 71.11%- indicating limited to moderate predictive ability for the axillary response to NAC. The SWE-based DLR model- with an accuracy of 80.81%- significantly outperformed the BUS-based DLR model- which scored 59.57%. The combination DLR model boasted an accuracy of 88.70% and a false-negative rate of 8.82%. It demonstrated strong discriminatory ability (AUC- 0.95)- precise calibration (p value obtained by Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test- 0.68)- and practical clinical utility (probability threshold- 2.5-97.5%). The combination SWE-based DLR model can predict the axillary status after NAC in patients with node-positive breast cancer- and thus- may inform clinical decision-making to help avoid unnecessary axillary LN dissection.

However- human interpretation of mammograms is often prone to diagnostic errors. This study addresses the challenge of improving the accuracy of breast cancer detection by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Methods: We propose an extended ensemble deep learning model that integrates three state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures: VGG16- DenseNet121- and InceptionV3. The model utilizes multi-scale feature extraction to enhance the detection of both benign and malignant masses in mammograms. This ensemble approach is evaluated on two benchmark datasets: INbreast and CBIS-DDSM. Results: The proposed ensemble model achieved significant performance improvements. On the INbreast dataset- the ensemble model attained an accuracy of 90.1%- recall of 88.3%- and an F1-score of 89.1%. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset- the model reached 89.5% accuracy and 90.2% specificity. The ensemble method outperformed each individual CNN model- reducing both false positives and false negatives- thereby providing more reliable diagnostic results. Conclusions: The ensemble deep learning model demonstrated strong potential as a decision support tool for radiologists- offering more accurate and earlier detection of breast cancer. By leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple CNN architectures- this approach can improve clinical decision making and enhance the accessibility of high-quality breast cancer screening.
