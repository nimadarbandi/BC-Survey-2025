Houmem Slimi- Sabeur Abid,Optimized Transfer Learning Models for Breast Cancer image classification,<title>Abstract</title> <p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical gene that serves as a receptor to transmit signals for aggressive cell division in cancer cells. Hence- testing of HER2 is important in treatment to indicate candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. However- in the current gold standard- i.e.- the immunohistochemistry (IHC) test- the scoring is based on the pathologistâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s analysis- which has an inter- and intra-observer variation chance due to variability in staining assessment. Automating HER2 scoring using hematoxyline eosin (HE) stained images can overcome these limitations- providing more accurate and consistent results- thereby reducing healthcare costs and enhancing patient outcomes. In this work- we have presented an automated framework for classifying HER2 scores of breast cancer using HE-stained images. The developed framework uses three fine-tuned deep learning models- namely GoogLeNet- ResNet-50- and Vision Transformer (ViT). It applies the proposed hybrid weighted individual voting ensemble (WIVE) to combine the confidence scores of all the constituent models. This approach comprises two independent techniques: the Model-Specific Weights Optimization (MSWO)- customizing weights for individual models- and the Class-Specific Weights Optimization (CSWO)- fine-tunes weights for specific classes using Probabilistic model-building genetic algorithms (PMBGAs). The proposed framework surpasses the existing methods in the literature. The CSWO approach achieves an accuracy of 99.42% and a precision of 99.54%- while the MSWO approach attains an accuracy of 99.07% and a precision of 99.21%. This study outlines an economically feasible and efficient prognostic model with the potential to provide clinically significant inputs. The use of this algorithm might offer a possibility for the replacement of IHC testing- minimizing the variability in HER2 scoring- as well as simplifying the diagnostic process.</p>

Sanitha P S -- Jayakrishnan B -,Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Prognosis Using Triple Hybrid Deep Learning Approach,Assistive medical image classifiers can greatly reduce the workload of medical personnel. However- traditional machine learning methods require large amounts of well-labeled data and long learning times to solve medical image classification problems- which can lead to high training costs and poor applicability. To address this problem- a novel unsupervised breast cancer image classification model based on multiscale texture analysis and a dynamic learning strategy for mammograms is proposed in this paper. First- a gray-level cooccurrence matrix and Tamura coarseness are used to transfer images to multiscale texture feature vectors. Then- an unsupervised dynamic learning mechanism is used to classify these vectors. In the simulation experiments with a resolution of 40 pixels- the accuracy- precision- F1-score and AUC of the proposed method reach 91.500%- 92.780%- 91.370%- and 91.500%- respectively. The experimental results show that the proposed method can provide an effective reference for breast cancer diagnosis.

Y. Forghani- R. Timotoe- M. Figueiredo- T. Marques- E. Batista- F. Cordoso- M.J. Cardoso- J. Santinha- P. Gouveia,Breast tissue segmentation in MR images using deep-learning,Breast cancer is one of the malignancies that affects women. Breast cancer is a condition that is brought on by abnormal breast cells that multiply and form tumours. If left untreated- tumours have the capacity to grow throughout the body and become fatal. Early initiation and thorough completion of treatment is associated with better outcomes and greater patient tolerance for breast cancer patients. These days- early detection of breast cancer is quite helpful and will help the women who battle the illness. The earliest detection of breast cancer can be successfully achieved with the use of machine learning-based approaches. Breast cancer can be diagnosed with great accuracy using a number of machine learning techniques- including CNN- RF- SVM- NB- KNN- AB- and others. Thus- I am introducing a triple hybrid deep learning method for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This is the CNN- GRU- and LSTM combination.
Zhe Lin,Breast cancer classification based on hybrid machine learning model,Automatic breast tumor segmentation based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is significant for the diagnosis and monitoring of breast cancers. CNNs have become an important method for early diagnosis of breast cancer and- thus- can help decrease the mortality rate. In order to assist medical professionals in breast cancer investigation a computerized system based on two encoder-decoder architectures for breast tumor segmentation has been developed. Two pre-trained DeepLabV3+ and U-Net models are proposed. The encoder generates a high-dimensional feature vector while the decoder analyses the low-resolution feature vector provided by the encoder and generates a semantic segmentation mask. Semantic segmentation based on deep learning techniques can overcome the limitations of traditional algorithms. To assess the efficiency of breast ultrasound image segmentation- we compare the segmentation results provided by CNNs against the Local Graph Cut technique (a semi-automatic segmentation method) in the Image Segmenter application. The output segmentation results have been evaluated by using the Dice similarity coefficient that compares the ground truth images provided by the specialists against the predicted segmentation results provided by the CNNs and Local Graph Cut algorithm. The proposed approach is validated on 780 breast ultrasonographic images of the BUSI public database of which 437 are benign and 210 are malignant. The BUSI database provides classification (benign or malignant) labels for ground truth in binary mask images. The average Dice scores computed between the ground truth images against CNNs were as follows: 0.9360 (malignant) and 0.9325 (benign) for the DeepLabV3+ architecture and of 0.6251 (malignant) and 0.6252 (benign) for the U-Net- respectively. When the segmentation results provided by CNNs were compared with the Local Graph Cut segmented images- the Dice scores were 0.9377 (malignant) and 0.9204 (benign) for DeepLabV3+ architecture and 0.6115 (malignant) and 0.6119 (benign) for U-Net- respectively. The results show that the DeepLabV3+ has significantly better segmentation performance and outperforms the U-Net network.

Sarathkumar M- Dhanalakshmi K S- Madhivadhani D- Revathi V,A Deep Learning Approach for Efficient Breast Cancer Diagnosis Using Hybrid CNN-BILSTM with Soft Attention Mechanism,Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant attention in the AI domain owing to their exemplary context recognition and response capabilities. However- the potential of LLMs in specific clinical scenarios- particularly in breast cancer diagnosis- treatment- and care- has not been fully explored. This study aimed to compare the performances of three major LLMs in the clinical context of breast cancer. In this study- clinical scenarios designed specifically for breast cancer were segmented into five pivotal domains (nine cases): assessment and diagnosis- treatment decision-making- postoperative care- psychosocial support- and prognosis and rehabilitation. The LLMs were used to generate feedback for various queries related to these domains. For each scenario- a panel of five breast cancer specialists- each with over a decade of experience- evaluated the feedback from LLMs. They assessed feedback concerning LLMs in terms of their quality- relevance- and applicability. There was a moderate level of agreement among the raters (Fleiss' kappa=0.345- P<0.05). Comparing the performance of different models regarding response length- GPT-4.0 and GPT-3.5 provided relatively longer feedback than Claude2. Furthermore- across the nine case analyses- GPT-4.0 significantly outperformed the other two models in average quality- relevance- and applicability. Within the five clinical areas- GPT-4.0 markedly surpassed GPT-3.5 in the quality of the other four areas and scored higher than Claude2 in tasks related to psychosocial support and treatment decision-making. This study revealed that in the realm of clinical applications for breast cancer- GPT-4.0 showcases not only superiority in terms of quality and relevance but also demonstrates exceptional capability in applicability- especially when compared to GPT-3.5. Relative to Claude2- GPT-4.0 holds advantages in specific domains. With the expanding use of LLMs in the clinical field- ongoing optimization and rigorous accuracy assessments are paramount.

Khadija Aguerchi- Y. Jabrane- Maryam Habba- Amir Hajjam El Hassani,A CNN Hyperparameters Optimization Based on Particle Swarm Optimization for Mammography Breast Cancer Classification,Objectives: To develop a model for the prediction of Breast cancer. Cancer is one of the deadliest diseases and it is regarded as the second leading cause of death in women throughout the sphere. Former detection of cancer can save the patient's life. Outliers can have an impact on the model's performance. For this reason- eliminating outliers is the first factor to be considered. Methods: In this study- the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset was used. It consists of 569 instances of which 357 instances are benign and 212 are malignant cases. It has 32 attributes including two class attribute labels (diagnosis: B= benign- M= malignant)- ID number- and 30 real value attributes. These attributes are computed from a digitized image of a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) procedure of a breast mass and are used to describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image. The HOTSM outlier detection approach- which handles anomalies in two stages- was proposed in the current study. First- the Inter Quartile Range (IQR) was employed to diminish the influence of outliers. After the analysis had been finished- the non-outlier data was transmitted to an isolation forest- wherein the absolute mean error was calculated. Pearson's Correlation was employed to minimize the dimensionality. Findings: For the performance evaluation- two datasets are generated; one using isolation forest and the other using HOTSM. The performance of both datasets is tested using SVM- Decision Tree- and Random Forest classifiers- highest accuracies are obtained as 97.80 %-96.80%- and 98.4% respectively. It was found that the dataset generated using the proposed method performed well. The proposed model is capable of identifying Breast cancer- more accurately. Novelty: The Interquartile Range has been utilized for altering the traditional isolation forest algorithm- enhancing performance metrics. The thorough removal of anomalies reduces the likelihood of misdiagnosis- yet they cannot exclude all outliers. Keywords: Outliers- Breast Cancer- Accuracy- Machine Learning- Hybrid

Yi-Ming Wang- Chi-Yuan Wang- Kuo-Ying Liu- Yung-Hui Huang- Tai-Been Chen- Kon-Ning Chiu- Chih-Yu Liang- Nan-Han Lu,CNN-Based Cross-Modality Fusion for Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammography and Ultrasound,Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer globally and is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women; therefore- early- automated- and precise detection is essential. Most AI-based techniques for breast cancer detection are complex and have high computational costs. Hence- to overcome this challenge- we have presented the innovative LightweightUNet hybrid deep learning (DL) classifier for the accurate classification of breast cancer. The proposed model boasts a low computational cost due to its smaller number of layers in its architecture- and its adaptive nature stems from its use of depth-wise separable convolution. We have employed a multimodal approach to validate the model's performance- using 13-000 images from two distinct modalities: mammogram imaging (MGI) and ultrasound imaging (USI). We collected the multimodal imaging datasets from seven different sources- including the benchmark datasets DDSM- MIAS- INbreast- BrEaST- BUSI- Thammasat- and HMSS. Since the datasets are from various sources- we have resized them to the uniform size of 256 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 256 pixels and normalized them using the Box-Cox transformation technique. Since the USI dataset is smaller- we have applied the StyleGAN3 model to generate 10-000 synthetic ultrasound images. In this work- we have performed two separate experiments: the first on a real dataset without augmentation and the second on a real + GAN-augmented dataset using our proposed method. During the experiments- we used a 5-fold cross-validation method- and our proposed model obtained good results on the real dataset (87.16% precision- 86.87% recall- 86.84% F1-score- and 86.87% accuracy) without adding any extra data. Similarly- the second experiment provides better performance on the real + GAN-augmented dataset (96.36% precision- 96.35% recall- 96.35% F1-score- and 96.35% accuracy). This multimodal approach- which utilizes LightweightUNet- enhances the performance by 9.20% in precision- 9.48% in recall- 9.51% in F1-score- and a 9.48% increase in accuracy on the combined dataset. The LightweightUNet model we proposed works very well thanks to a creative network design- adding fake images to the data- and a multimodal training method. These results show that the model has a lot of potential for use in clinical settings.
Guangliang Yang- Haiqi Chen- Jinchao Yue,Deep learning to optimize radiotherapy decisions for elderly patients with early-stage breast cancer: a novel approach for personalized treatment,Accurately and swiftly segmenting breast tumors is significant for cancer diagnosis and treatment. Ultrasound imaging stands as one of the widely employed methods in clinical practice. However- due to challenges such as low contrast- blurred boundaries- and prevalent shadows in ultrasound images- tumor segmentation remains a daunting task. In this study- we propose BCT-Net- a network amalgamating CNN and transformer components for breast tumor segmentation. BCT-Net integrates a dual-level attention mechanism to capture more features and redefines the skip connection module. We introduce the utilization of a classification task as an auxiliary task to impart additional semantic information to the segmentation network- employing supervised contrastive learning. A hybrid objective loss function is proposed- which combines pixel-wise cross-entropy- binary cross-entropy- and supervised contrastive learning loss. Experimental results demonstrate that BCT-Net achieves high precision- with Pre and DSC indices of 86.12% and 88.70%- respectively. Experiments conducted on the BUSI dataset of breast ultrasound images manifest that this approach exhibits high accuracy in breast tumor segmentation.
Xiao Guo- Jiaying Xing- Yuyan Cao- Wenchuang Yang- Xinlin Shi- Runhong Mu- Tao Wang,Machine learning based anoikis signature predicts personalized treatment strategy of breast cancer,The vision transformer (ViT) architecture- with its attention mechanism based on multi-head attention layers- has been widely adopted in various computer-aided diagnosis tasks due to its effectiveness in processing medical image information. ViTs are notably recognized for their complex architecture- which requires high-performance GPUs or CPUs for efficient model training and deployment in real-world medical diagnostic devices. This renders them more intricate than convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This difficulty is also challenging in the context of histopathology image analysis- where the images are both limited and complex. In response to these challenges- this study proposes a TokenMixer hybrid-architecture that combines the strengths of CNNs and ViTs. This hybrid architecture aims to enhance feature extraction and classification accuracy with shorter training time and fewer parameters by minimizing the number of input patches employed during training- while incorporating tokenization of input patches using convolutional layers and encoder transformer layers to process patches across all network layers for fast and accurate breast cancer tumor subtype classification. The TokenMixer mechanism is inspired by the ConvMixer and TokenLearner models. First- the ConvMixer model dynamically generates spatial attention maps using convolutional layers- enabling the extraction of patches from input images to minimize the number of input patches used in training.

HM Balaha- KM Ali- D Gondim- M Ghazal- ...,Harnessing Vision Transformers for Precise and Explainable Breast Cancer Diagnosis,This study presents a novel approach to enhance the accuracy of breast cancer detection from mammogram images through a hybrid feature selection and classification framework. Leveraging the power of XGBoost- a state-of-the-art machine learning algorithm- an embedded genetic algorithm is introduced for optimal feature selection. The genetic algorithm refines the feature set by iteratively evolving towards a subset that maximizes the discriminative power for breast cancer diagnosis. Subsequently- the selected features are fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture with Random Boolean Networks (RBN) for classification. The RNN-RBN model captures intricate temporal dependencies within the image data- providing a nuanced understanding of the complex patterns indicative of breast cancer. The synergistic coupling of the XGBoost-embedded genetic algorithm for feature selection and the RNN-RBN model for classification results in a robust and interpretable system for breast cancer detection. The proposed hybrid approach is evaluated on a comprehensive dataset of mammogram images- demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional methods. The combination of feature selection through XGBoost- embedded genetic algorithms and RNN-RBN classification showcases the potential for advanced- accurate- and efficient breast cancer diagnosis- holding promise for improving early detection rates and patient outcomes in clinical settings.
Yi-Ming Wang- Chi-Yuan Wang- Kuo-Ying Liu- Yung-Hui Huang- Tai-Been Chen- Kon-Ning Chiu- Chih-Yu Liang- Nan-Han Lu,CNN-Based Cross-Modality Fusion for Enhanced Breast Cancer Detection Using Mammography and Ultrasound,Breast cancer ranks as the second most prevalent cancer globally and is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women; therefore- early- automated- and precise detection is essential. Most AI-based techniques for breast cancer detection are complex and have high computational costs. Hence- to overcome this challenge- we have presented the innovative LightweightUNet hybrid deep learning (DL) classifier for the accurate classification of breast cancer. The proposed model boasts a low computational cost due to its smaller number of layers in its architecture- and its adaptive nature stems from its use of depth-wise separable convolution. We have employed a multimodal approach to validate the model's performance- using 13-000 images from two distinct modalities: mammogram imaging (MGI) and ultrasound imaging (USI). We collected the multimodal imaging datasets from seven different sources- including the benchmark datasets DDSM- MIAS- INbreast- BrEaST- BUSI- Thammasat- and HMSS. Since the datasets are from various sources- we have resized them to the uniform size of 256 â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšâ€ âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ¢â€¢ 256 pixels and normalized them using the Box-Cox transformation technique. Since the USI dataset is smaller- we have applied the StyleGAN3 model to generate 10-000 synthetic ultrasound images. In this work- we have performed two separate experiments: the first on a real dataset without augmentation and the second on a real + GAN-augmented dataset using our proposed method. During the experiments- we used a 5-fold cross-validation method- and our proposed model obtained good results on the real dataset (87.16% precision- 86.87% recall- 86.84% F1-score- and 86.87% accuracy) without adding any extra data. Similarly- the second experiment provides better performance on the real + GAN-augmented dataset (96.36% precision- 96.35% recall- 96.35% F1-score- and 96.35% accuracy). This multimodal approach- which utilizes LightweightUNet- enhances the performance by 9.20% in precision- 9.48% in recall- 9.51% in F1-score- and a 9.48% increase in accuracy on the combined dataset. The LightweightUNet model we proposed works very well thanks to a creative network design- adding fake images to the data- and a multimodal training method. These results show that the model has a lot of potential for use in clinical settings.

Gouveia,Breast tissue segmentation in MR images using deep-learning,Breast cancer is one of the malignancies that affects women. Breast cancer is a condition that is brought on by abnormal breast cells that multiply and form tumours. If left untreated- tumours have the capacity to grow throughout the body and become fatal. Early initiation and thorough completion of treatment is associated with better outcomes and greater patient tolerance for breast cancer patients. These days- early detection of breast cancer is quite helpful and will help the women who battle the illness. The earliest detection of breast cancer can be successfully achieved with the use of machine learning-based approaches. Breast cancer can be diagnosed with great accuracy using a number of machine learning techniques- including CNN- RF- SVM- NB- KNN- AB- and others. Thus- I am introducing a triple hybrid deep learning method for breast cancer diagnosis and prognosis. This is the CNN- GRU- and LSTM combination.

Timely detection of such cancer types is crucial- and recent research- employing deep learning techniques- shows promise in earlier detection. The research focuses on the early detection of such tumors using mammogram images with deep-learning models. The paper utilized four public databases where a similar amount of 986 mammograms each for three classes (normal- benign- malignant) are taken for evaluation.

Houmem Slimi- Sabeur Abid,Optimized Transfer Learning Models for Breast Cancer image classification,<title>Abstract</title> <p>Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) is a critical gene that serves as a receptor to transmit signals for aggressive cell division in cancer cells. Hence- testing of HER2 is important in treatment to indicate candidates for HER2-targeted therapy. However- in the current gold standard- i.e.- the immunohistochemistry (IHC) test- the scoring is based on the pathologistâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s analysis- which has an inter- and intra-observer variation chance due to variability in staining assessment. Automating HER2 scoring using hematoxyline eosin (HE) stained images can overcome these limitations- providing more accurate and consistent results- thereby reducing healthcare costs and enhancing patient outcomes. In this work- we have presented an automated framework for classifying HER2 scores of breast cancer using HE-stained images. The developed framework uses three fine-tuned deep learning models- namely GoogLeNet- ResNet-50- and Vision Transformer (ViT). It applies the proposed hybrid weighted individual voting ensemble (WIVE) to combine the confidence scores of all the constituent models. This approach comprises two independent techniques: the Model-Specific Weights Optimization (MSWO)- customizing weights for individual models- and the Class-Specific Weights Optimization (CSWO)- fine-tunes weights for specific classes using Probabilistic model-building genetic algorithms (PMBGAs). The proposed framework surpasses the existing methods in the literature. The CSWO approach achieves an accuracy of 99.42% and a precision of 99.54%- while the MSWO approach attains an accuracy of 99.07% and a precision of 99.21%. This study outlines an economically feasible and efficient prognostic model with the potential to provide clinically significant inputs. The use of this algorithm might offer a possibility for the replacement of IHC testing- minimizing the variability in HER2 scoring- as well as simplifying the diagnostic process.</p>
Aslâ€šÃ Ãœâˆšâ‰ Â¬Â¨Â¬Â±nur Albayrak- Kayhan Nuri Cengiz,Assessment of breast cancer awareness among female pharmacy students at a university in Turkey,Breast cancer remains a pressing global health concern- necessitating accurate diagnostics for effective interventions. Deep learning models (AlexNet- ResNet-50- VGG16- GoogLeNet) show remarkable microcalcification identification (>90%). However- distinct architectures and methodologies pose challenges. We propose an ensemble model- merging unique perspectives- enhancing precision- and understanding critical factors for breast cancer intervention. Evaluation favors GoogleNet and ResNet-50- driving their selection for combined functionalities- ensuring improved precision- and dependability in microcalcification detection in clinical settings. This study presents a comprehensive mammogram preprocessing framework using an optimized deep learning ensemble approach. The proposed framework begins with artifact removal using Otsu Segmentation and morphological operation. Subsequent steps include image resizing- adaptive median filtering- and deep convolutional neural network (D-CNN) development via transfer learning with ResNet-50 model. Hyperparameters are optimized- and ensemble optimization (AlexNet- GoogLeNet- VGG16- ResNet-50) are constructed to identify the localized area of microcalcification. Rigorous evaluation protocol validates the efficacy of individual models- culminating in the ensemble model demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Based on our analysis- the proposed ensemble model exhibited exceptional performance in the classification of microcalcifications. This was evidenced by the model's average confidence score- which indicated a high degree of dependability and certainty in differentiating these critical characteristics. The proposed model demonstrated a noteworthy average confidence level of 0.9305 in the classification of microcalcification- outperforming alternative models and providing substantial insights into the dependability of the model. The average confidence of the ensemble model in classifying normal cases was 0.8859- which strengthened the model's consistent and dependable predictions. In addition- the ensemble models attained remarkably high performances in terms of accuracy- precision- recall- F1-score- and area under the curve (AUC). The proposed model's thorough dataset integration and focus on average confidence ratings within classes improve clinical diagnosis accuracy and effectiveness for breast cancer. This study introduces a novel methodology that takes advantage of an ensemble model and rigorous evaluation standards to substantially improve the accuracy and dependability of breast cancer diagnostics- specifically in the detection of microcalcifications.
S R Sannasi Chakravarthy- N Bharanidharan- V Vinoth Kumar- T R Mahesh- Mohammed S Alqahtani- Suresh Guluwadi,Deep transfer learning with fuzzy ensemble approach for the early detection of breast cancer,The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor tissue can offer valuable insights into TIME- but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultrahigh-resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However- few study pay attention to the quantitative estimation of various tumor infiltration immune cells from pathology images. In this paper- we integrated contrastive learning and weakly supervised learning to infer tumor-associated macrophages and potential immunotherapy benefit from whole slide images (WSIs) of H &E stained pathological sections. We split the high-resolution WSIs into tiles and then apply contrastive learning to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level- we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that the computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells- particularly the infiltration level of macrophages- as well as the immune subtypes and potential immunotherapy benefit. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision- establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology- thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images.

Early detection and proper treatment reduce mortality rates. Histopathological images provide detailed information for diagnosing and staging breast cancer disease. Methods: The BreakHis dataset- which includes histopathological images- is used in this study. Medical images are prone to problems such as different textural backgrounds and overlapping cell structures- unbalanced class distribution- and insufficiently labeled data. In addition to these- the limitations of deep learning models in overfitting and insufficient feature extraction make it extremely difficult to obtain a high-performance model in this dataset. In this study- 20 state-of-the-art models are trained to diagnose eight types of breast cancer using the fine-tuning method. In addition- a comprehensive experimental study was conducted to determine the most successful new model- with 20 different custom models reported. As a result- we propose a novel model called MultiHisNet. Results: The most effective new model- which included a pointwise convolution layer- residual link- channel- and spatial attention module- achieved 94.69% accuracy in multi-class breast cancer classification. An ensemble model was created with the best-performing transfer learning and custom models obtained in the study- and model weights were determined with an Equilibrium Optimizer. The proposed ensemble model achieved 96.71% accuracy in eight-class breast cancer detection.

The objective of this study is to present an automated analysis and classification system for breast cancer using clinical markers such as tumor shape- orientation- margin- and surrounding tissue. The novelty and uniqueness of the study lie in the approach of considering medical features based on the diagnosis of radiologists. Methods Using clinical markers- a graph is generated where each feature is represented by a node- and the connection between them is represented by an edge which is derived through Pearson's correlation method. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model is proposed to classify breast tumors into benign and malignant- using the graph data. Several statistical tests are performed to assess the importance of the proposed features. The performance of the proposed GCN model is improved by experimenting with different layer configurations and hyper-parameter settings. Results Results show that the proposed model has a 98.73% test accuracy. The performance of the model is compared with a graph attention network- a one-dimensional convolutional neural network- and five transfer learning models- ten machine learning models- and three ensemble learning models. The performance of the model was further assessed with three supplementary breast cancer ultrasound image datasets- where the accuracies are 91.03%- 94.37%- and 89.62% for Dataset A- Dataset B- and Dataset C (combining Dataset A and Dataset B) respectively. Overfitting issues are assessed through k-fold cross-validation. Conclusion Several variants are utilized to present a more rigorous and fair evaluation of our work- especially the importance of extracting clinically relevant features. Moreover- a GCN model using graph data can be a promising solution for an automated feature-based breast image classification system.

Alhussein,Discriminative Dictionary Learning Using Penalized Rank-1 Approximation for Breast Cancer Classification With Imbalanced Dataset,Analysis of histopathological images (HIs) is crucial for detecting breast cancer (BR). However- because they vary- it is still very difficult to extract well-designed elements. Deep learning (DL) is a recent development that is used to extract high-level features. However- DL techniques continue to confront several difficult problems- such as the need for sufficient training data for DL models- which reduces the classification findings. In this study- an ensemble deep transfer convolutional neural network is presented to address this problem. The pre-trained models (ResNet50 and MobileNet) are employed to extract high-level features by freezing the front layer parameters while fine-tuning the last layers. In the proposed ensemble framework- KNN- SVM- logistic regression and neural networks are used as base classifiers. The majority vote and product approaches are used to integrate the predictions of each separate classifier. In the benchmark BreaKHis dataset- the suggested ensemble model is compared to some current approaches. It demonstrates that while the ensemble model obtains a considerable accuracy of 97.72% for the multiclass classification test- it achieves an accuracy of 99.2% for the binary task. The suggested ensemble modelâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬â€¢s effectiveness in extracting useful features for BR images is demonstrated by comparison with existing cutting-edge models.

Ayman Alsabry- Malek Algabri,Iterative Tuning of Tree-Ensemble-Based Models' parameters Using Bayesian Optimization for Breast Cancer Prediction,Breast cancer- a widespread malignancy predominantly affecting women aged 40 and above- presents a significant global health challenge with high mortality rates. The scarcity of medical data underscores the need for collaborative efforts among hospitals to enhance automated breast cancer detection. This research employs decentralized Federated Learning (FL) to facilitate cooperative learning across an interconnected smart hospital network- addressing data privacy- regulatory compliance- voluminous medical image data- and the necessity for distributed machine learning. Our innovative approach integrates Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) for hyperparameter fine-tuning and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in a collaborative framework for smart hospitals linked with decentralized edge intelligent networks. This optimization strategy significantly improves the performance of our breast cancer detection system. Through a comprehensive experimental study (including diverse datasets)- we classify Normal vs. Mass and Benign vs. Malignant regions in mammograms within a decentralized- federated collaborative learning environment. Empirical results consistently highlight the superiority of models trained using our method over individual hospital client-level training. Our method yielded significant improvements across evaluation measures: for Normal vs. Mass- achieving 92.6% sensitivity- 93.0% specificity- and 93.0% accuracy; for Benign vs. Malignant- achieving 89.6% sensitivity- 91.6% specificity- and 89.7% accuracy. Moreover- it has obtained a 6% and 5% increase in accuracy for Normal vs. Mass and Benign vs. Malignant cases- respectively- compared to the PSO-based HPO method. This evidence underscores the potential of collaborative approaches- emphasizing decentralized FL as a robust paradigm in medical research. The incorporation of ACO optimization reinforces the effectiveness of the proposed computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system- marking a noteworthy advancement in the ongoing fight against breast cancer.

Ziming Liu,Improving breast cancer classification using histopathology images through deep learning,The most fatal disease affecting women worldwide now is breast cancer. Early detection of breast cancer enhances the likelihood of a full recovery and lowers mortality. Based on medical imaging- researchers from all around the world are developing breast cancer screening technologies.

Rigorous evaluation protocol validates the efficacy of individual models- culminating in the ensemble model demonstrating superior predictive accuracy. Based on our analysis- the proposed ensemble model exhibited exceptional performance in the classification of microcalcifications. This was evidenced by the model's average confidence score- which indicated a high degree of dependability and certainty in differentiating these critical characteristics. The proposed model demonstrated a noteworthy average confidence level of 0.9305 in the classification of microcalcification- outperforming alternative models and providing substantial insights into the dependability of the model. The average confidence of the ensemble model in classifying normal cases was 0.8859- which strengthened the model's consistent and dependable predictions. In addition- the ensemble models attained remarkably high performances in terms of accuracy- precision- recall- F1-score- and area under the curve (AUC). The proposed model's thorough dataset integration and focus on average confidence ratings within classes improve clinical diagnosis accuracy and effectiveness for breast cancer. This study introduces a novel methodology that takes advantage of an ensemble model and rigorous evaluation standards to substantially improve the accuracy and dependability of breast cancer diagnostics- specifically in the detection of microcalcifications.
S R Sannasi Chakravarthy- N Bharanidharan- V Vinoth Kumar- T R Mahesh- Mohammed S Alqahtani- Suresh Guluwadi,Deep transfer learning with fuzzy ensemble approach for the early detection of breast cancer,The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors is significantly influenced by the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME). RNA sequencing of tumor tissue can offer valuable insights into TIME- but its high cost and long turnaround time seriously restrict its utility in routine clinical examinations. Several recent studies have suggested that ultrahigh-resolution pathology images can infer cellular and molecular characteristics. However- few study pay attention to the quantitative estimation of various tumor infiltration immune cells from pathology images. In this paper- we integrated contrastive learning and weakly supervised learning to infer tumor-associated macrophages and potential immunotherapy benefit from whole slide images (WSIs) of H &E stained pathological sections. We split the high-resolution WSIs into tiles and then apply contrastive learning to extract features of each tile. After aggregating the features at the tile level- we employ weak supervisory signals to fine-tune the encoder for various downstream tasks. Comprehensive experiments on two independent breast cancer cohorts and spatial transcriptomics data demonstrate that the computational pathological features accurately predict the proportion of tumor-infiltrating immune cells- particularly the infiltration level of macrophages- as well as the immune subtypes and potential immunotherapy benefit. These findings demonstrate that our model effectively captures pathological features beyond human vision- establishing a mapping relationship between cellular compositions and histological morphology- thus expanding the clinical applications of digital pathology images.

Alhussein,Discriminative Dictionary Learning Using Penalized Rank-1 Approximation for Breast Cancer Classification With Imbalanced Dataset,Analysis of histopathological images (HIs) is crucial for detecting breast cancer (BR). However- because they vary- it is still very difficult to extract well-designed elements. Deep learning (DL) is a recent development that is used to extract high-level features. However- DL techniques continue to confront several difficult problems- such as the need for sufficient training data for DL models- which reduces the classification findings. In this study- an ensemble deep transfer convolutional neural network is presented to address this problem. The pre-trained models (ResNet50 and MobileNet) are employed to extract high-level features by freezing the front layer parameters while fine-tuning the last layers. In the proposed ensemble framework- KNN- SVM- logistic regression and neural networks are used as base classifiers. The majority vote and product approaches are used to integrate the predictions of each separate classifier. In the benchmark BreaKHis dataset- the suggested ensemble model is compared to some current approaches. It demonstrates that while the ensemble model obtains a considerable accuracy of 97.72% for the multiclass classification test- it achieves an accuracy of 99.2% for the binary task.

Early detection and proper treatment reduce mortality rates. Histopathological images provide detailed information for diagnosing and staging breast cancer disease. Methods: The BreakHis dataset- which includes histopathological images- is used in this study. Medical images are prone to problems such as different textural backgrounds and overlapping cell structures- unbalanced class distribution- and insufficiently labeled data. In addition to these- the limitations of deep learning models in overfitting and insufficient feature extraction make it extremely difficult to obtain a high-performance model in this dataset. In this study- 20 state-of-the-art models are trained to diagnose eight types of breast cancer using the fine-tuning method. In addition- a comprehensive experimental study was conducted to determine the most successful new model- with 20 different custom models reported. As a result- we propose a novel model called MultiHisNet. Results: The most effective new model- which included a pointwise convolution layer- residual link- channel- and spatial attention module- achieved 94.69% accuracy in multi-class breast cancer classification. An ensemble model was created with the best-performing transfer learning and custom models obtained in the study- and model weights were determined with an Equilibrium Optimizer. The proposed ensemble model achieved 96.71% accuracy in eight-class breast cancer detection. Conclusions: The results show that the proposed model will support pathologists in successfully diagnosing breast cancer.

The objective of this study is to present an automated analysis and classification system for breast cancer using clinical markers such as tumor shape- orientation- margin- and surrounding tissue. The novelty and uniqueness of the study lie in the approach of considering medical features based on the diagnosis of radiologists. Methods Using clinical markers- a graph is generated where each feature is represented by a node- and the connection between them is represented by an edge which is derived through Pearson's correlation method. A graph convolutional network (GCN) model is proposed to classify breast tumors into benign and malignant- using the graph data. Several statistical tests are performed to assess the importance of the proposed features. The performance of the proposed GCN model is improved by experimenting with different layer configurations and hyper-parameter settings. Results Results show that the proposed model has a 98.73% test accuracy. The performance of the model is compared with a graph attention network- a one-dimensional convolutional neural network- and five transfer learning models- ten machine learning models- and three ensemble learning models. The performance of the model was further assessed with three supplementary breast cancer ultrasound image datasets- where the accuracies are 91.03%- 94.37%- and 89.62% for Dataset A- Dataset B- and Dataset C (combining Dataset A and Dataset B) respectively. Overfitting issues are assessed through k-fold cross-validation. Conclusion Several variants are utilized to present a more rigorous and fair evaluation of our work- especially the importance of extracting clinically relevant features. Moreover- a GCN model using graph data can be a promising solution for an automated feature-based breast image classification system.

Timely detection of such cancer types is crucial- and recent research- employing deep learning techniques- shows promise in earlier detection. The research focuses on the early detection of such tumors using mammogram images with deep-learning models. The paper utilized four public databases where a similar amount of 986 mammograms each for three classes (normal- benign- malignant) are taken for evaluation. Herein- three deep CNN models such as VGG-11- Inception v3- and ResNet50 are employed as base classifiers. The research adopts an ensemble method where the proposed approach makes use of the modified Gompertz function for building a fuzzy ranking of the base classification models and their decision scores are integrated in an adaptive manner for constructing the final prediction of results. The classification results of the proposed fuzzy ensemble approach outperform transfer learning models and other ensemble approaches such as weighted average and Sugeno integral techniques. The proposed ResNet50 ensemble network using the modified Gompertz function-based fuzzy ranking approach provides a superior classification accuracy of 98.986%.
Ziming Liu,Improving breast cancer classification using histopathology images through deep learning,The most fatal disease affecting women worldwide now is breast cancer. Early detection of breast cancer enhances the likelihood of a full recovery and lowers mortality. Based on medical imaging- researchers from all around the world are developing breast cancer screening technologies. Due to their rapid progress- deep learning algorithms have caught the interest of many in the field of medical imaging. This research proposes a novel method in mammogram image feature extraction with classification and optimization using machine learning in breast cancer detection. The input image has been processed for noise removal- smoothening- and normalization.

Rajon Dash- Md Saidur Rahman Kohinoor- Promise Ghosh Chowdhury,Comprehensive Analysis of Machine and Deep Learning Models for Breast Cancer Diagnosis and Risk Assessment with Diverse Datasets,Background: Accurate detection of axillary lymph node (ALN) metastases in breast cancer is crucial for clinical staging and treatment planning. This study aims to develop a deep learning model using clinical implication-applied preprocessed computed tomography (CT) images to enhance the prediction of ALN metastasis in breast cancer patients. Methods: A total of 1128 axial CT images of ALN (538 malignant and 590 benign lymph nodes) were collected from 523 breast cancer patients who underwent preoperative CT scans between January 2012 and July 2022 at Hallym University Medical Center. To develop an optimal deep learning model for distinguishing metastatic ALN from benign ALN- a CT image preprocessing protocol with clinical implications and two different cropping methods (fixed size crop [FSC] method and adjustable square crop [ASC] method) were employed. The images were analyzed using three different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures (ResNet- DenseNet- and EfficientNet). Ensemble methods involving and combining the selection of the two best-performing CNN architectures from each cropping method were applied to generate the final result. Results: For the two different cropping methods- DenseNet consistently outperformed ResNet and EfficientNet. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for DenseNet- using the FSC and ASC methods- was 0.934 and 0.939- respectively. The ensemble model- which combines the performance of the DenseNet121 architecture for both cropping methods- delivered outstanding results with an AUROC of 0.968- an accuracy of 0.938- a sensitivity of 0.980- and a specificity of 0.903. Furthermore- distinct trends observed in gradient-weighted class activation mapping images with the two cropping methods suggest that our deep learning model not only evaluates the lymph node itself- but also distinguishes subtler changes in lymph node margin and adjacent soft tissue- which often elude human interpretation. Conclusions: This research demonstrates the promising performance of a deep learning model in accurately detecting malignant ALNs in breast cancer patients using CT images. The integration of clinical considerations into image processing and the utilization of ensemble methods further improved diagnostic precision.

Deep learning models (AlexNet- ResNet-50- VGG16- GoogLeNet) show remarkable microcalcification identification (>90%). However- distinct architectures and methodologies pose challenges. We propose an ensemble model- merging unique perspectives- enhancing precision- and understanding critical factors for breast cancer intervention. Evaluation favors GoogleNet and ResNet-50- driving their selection for combined functionalities- ensuring improved precision- and dependability in microcalcification detection in clinical settings. This study presents a comprehensive mammogram preprocessing framework using an optimized deep learning ensemble approach.

Vahab Khoshdel- Nasrin Abharian- Amir Attar- Joe LoVetri,Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for Generating Tissue Type Breast Image Dataset,In medical imaging- the effective detection and classification of Breast Cancer (BC) is a current research important task because of the still existing difficulty to distinguish abnormalities from normal breast tissues due to their subtle appearance and ambiguous margins and distinguish abnormalities from the normal breast. Moreover- BC detection based on an automated detection model is needed- because manual diagnosis faces problems due to cost and shortage of skilled manpower- and also takes a very long time. Using deep learning and ensemble feature selection techniques- in this paper- a novel framework is introduced for classifying BC from histopathology images. The five primary steps of the suggested framework are as follows: 1) to make the largest original dataset and then deep learning model with data augmentation to improve the learning. 2) The best features are selected by an Ensemble Filter Feature selection Method (EFFM) which combines the best feature subsets to produce the final feature subsets. 3) Then the pruned Convolution Neural Network (CNN) model is utilized to extract the optimal features. 4) Finally- the classification is done through the Triplet Attention based Efficient Network (TAENet) classifier. The suggested model produces a 98% accuracy rate after being trained and tested on two different histopathology imaging datasets including images from four different data cohorts. Subsequently- the suggested strategy outperforms the conventional ones since the ensemble filter habitually acquires the best features- and experimental results demonstrate the importance of the proposed approach

We propose deep learning techniques along with image processing for the detection of tumors. The availability of online datasets and advances in graphical processing units (GPU) have promoted the application of deep learning models for the detection of breast cancer. In this paper- deep learning models using convolutional neural network (CNN) have been built to automatically classify mammograms into benign and malignant. Issues like overfitting and dataset imbalance are overcome. Experimentation has been done on two publicly available datasets- namely mammographic image analysis society (MIAS) database and digital database for screening mammography (DDSM). Robustness of the models is accomplished by merging the datasets. In our experimentation- MatConvNet has achieved an accuracy of 94.2% on the merged dataset- performing the best amongst all the CNN models used individually. Hungarian optimization algorithm is employed for selection of individual CNN models to form an ensemble. Ensemble of CNN models led to an improved performance- resulting in an accuracy of 95.7%.
Oluwatosin Seyi Oyebanji- Akinkunmi Rasheed APAMPA- Olugesun Afolabi- Samson Ohikhuare Eromonsei- Akeem Babalola,Performance benchmarking of convolutional neural networks and ensemble machine learning techniques for automated mammographic breast cancer detection: A comparative study,Abstract: Invasion of neighboring tissues is a cardinal feature of malignancy- notably observed in aggressive cancers like breast cancer- where it can lead to significant morbidity. To explore cancer invasion dynamics- the implementation of a three-dimensional (3D) tumor spheroid invasion assay offers a swift approach to mimicking a tumor micro-region or micro-metastasis. Differential Interference Contrast (DIC) time-lapse imaging was chosen for its fluorescence-free and non-destructive advantages in capturing live spheroid movement. However- the subsequent analysis posed challenges- including out-of-focus cells and a voluminous dataset with diverse microscope planes and time points. Our study introduces a segmentation framework featuring in-focus spatial stacking algorithm and novel training architecture that enabling in-depth automated analysis of 3D spheroid invasion behaviors within a microenvironment. Firstly- the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer spheroids were cultured in a microwell dish and then incorporated into a collagen type I matrix for the 3D spheroid invasion assay. Capturing spheroid invasion dynamics involved acquiring 15 z-plane images (spaced at 20 Â¬Â¨Â¬Â®Â¬Â¨Â¬Âµm intervals) per timepoint for each spheroid using DIC microscopy at 15-minute intervals over a 28-hour period- employing a 20X objective lens. We refined the Focus Stacking framework into Multiple Slices Blurry Stacking (MSB-Stack) by pre-filtering blurred areas before stacking images. This process produced 6390 slices consolidated into 426 labeled stacked images- highlighting Invasive area- Spheroid core- and Invasive cells post-invasion. We then enhanced Mask R-CNN (Region based-Convolutional Neural Networks) with a weak-to-strong augmentation mechanism- leveraging well-segmented samples from MSB-Stack for training on both fully stacked and blurred images. Blurry Consistency Mask R-CNN (BCMask R-CNN) demonstrates overall improvement across feature extractors- outperforming Mask R-CNN. Using Mean average precision (mAP) as the main metric for instance segmentation and detection- our proposed model achieves 73.0% and 65.2% on mAP @[0.5- 0.95]- showcasing robustness. Notably- our best results for mAP @0.5 reach 96.6% and 96.7% on both tasks- underscoring the effectiveness of consistency training in mitigating unclear boundary issues during preprocessing. In conclusion- our proposed method- MSB-Stack- effectively addresses the challenge of unclear boundaries in 3D breast cancer cell DIC microscopy datasets. The integration of weak-to-strong consistency training in our model- BCMask R-CNN- not only mitigates biases but also enhances performance across different backbones- setting the stage for future advancements in cell-tracking tasks and broader migratory analyses.

This study enrolled 512 female patients diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer through pathological validation at our institution from January 2016 to December 2021. Five distinct deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a deep ensemble (DE) approach were trained to classify axillary lymph node involvement (ALNM)- lymphovascular invasion (LVI)- and histological grade (HG). The efficacy of the models was evaluated based on accuracy- sensitivity- specificity- positive predictive value (PPV)- negative predictive value (NPV)- receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves- areas under the ROC curve (AUCs)- and heat maps. DeLong test was applied to compare differences in AUC among different models. The deep ensemble approach- as the most effective model- demonstrated AUCs and accuracy of 0.869 (95% CI: 0.802-0.936) and 69.7% in LVI- 0.973 (95% CI: 0.949-0.998) and 73.8% in HG- thus providing superior classification performance in the context of imbalanced data (pâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢<â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Â¬Â¢0.05 by the DeLong test). On ALNM- AUC and accuracy were 0.780 (95% CI: 0.688-0.873) and 77.5%- which were comparable to other single models. The pretreatment US-based DE model could hold promise as a clinical guidance for predicting pathological characteristics of patients with HER2-positive breast cancer- thereby providing benefit of facilitating timely adjustments in treatment strategies.

On the INbreast dataset- the ensemble model attained an accuracy of 90.1%- recall of 88.3%- and an F1-score of 89.1%. For the CBIS-DDSM dataset- the model reached 89.5% accuracy and 90.2% specificity. The ensemble method outperformed each individual CNN model- reducing both false positives and false negatives- thereby providing more reliable diagnostic results. Conclusions: The ensemble deep learning model demonstrated strong potential as a decision support tool for radiologists- offering more accurate and earlier detection of breast cancer. By leveraging the complementary strengths of multiple CNN architectures- this approach can improve clinical decision making and enhance the accessibility of high-quality breast cancer screening.

The study used clinical notes from 2010 to 2021 from a tertiary hospital in the USA. The notes were processed through various NLP techniques- including vectorisation methods (term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF)- Word2Vec- Doc2Vec) and classification models (support vector classification- K-nearest neighbours (KNN)- random forest (RF)). Feature selection and optimisation through random search and fivefold cross-validation were also conducted. The study annotated 100 out of 1000 clinical notes- using 970 notes to build the text corpus. TF-IDF and Doc2Vec combined with RF showed the highest performance- while Word2Vec was less effective. RF classifier demonstrated the best performance- although with lower recall rates- suggesting more false negatives. KNN showed lower recall due to its sensitivity to data noise. The study highlights the significance of using NLP in analysing clinical notes to understand breast cancer treatment outcomes in under-represented populations. The TF-IDF and Doc2Vec models were more effective in capturing relevant information than Word2Vec. The study observed lower recall rates in RF models- attributed to the dataset's imbalanced nature and the complexity of clinical notes. The study developed high-performing NLP pipeline to capture treatment outcomes for breast cancer in under-represented populations- demonstrating the importance of document-level vectorisation and ensemble methods in clinical notes analysis. The findings provide insights for more equitable healthcare strategies and show the potential for broader NLP applications in clinical settings.

The objective of this study is to contribute to the growing body of knowledge in breast cancer diagnosis- highlighting the potential of a range of classifier algorithms- soft and hard voting ensemble approaches- and neural networks as potent tools in medical applications. These models were utilized to assess the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository- consisting of 569 samples and 30 features. Besides- we utilized Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) techniques to perform feature selection and dimensionality reduction on the standardized and original features respectively. After conducting PCA analysis- a variety of classifier models- including k-nearest neighbors (KNN)- Lo-gistic Regression (LR)- Decision Tree (DT)- LightGBM (LGBM)- XGBoost (XGB)- Random Forest (RF)- and Naive Bayes (NB)- were employed. Moreover- after the VIF analysis- these classifier models and a Neural Network (NN) model were put into action. Subsequently- the best three and best five classifier algorithms were determined using accuracy metrics- then both soft and hard voting ensemble were executed on these algorithms. The neural network (NN) model underwent training for 500 epochs since beyond that point- the loss curves displayed nearly constant values. This model (NN) were compiled with â€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶â€šÃ Â´adamâ€šÃ„Ã¶âˆšÃ‘âˆšâˆ‚â€šÃ Ã¶âˆšÃ«â€šÃ Ã¶Å“Ã„ optimizer along with binary crossentropy as loss function. We observed our ensemble strategies demonstrated superior performance in accuracy compared to all existing methods.
